<h3>SCENE I.  Troy. Before Priam's palace.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter TROILUS armed, and PANDARUS</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TROILUS</li>
  <li>Call here my varlet; I'll unarm again:</li>
  <li>Why should I war without the walls of Troy,</li>
  <li>That find such cruel battle here within?</li>
  <li>Each Trojan that is master of his heart,</li>
  <li class="number">Let him to field; Troilus, alas! hath none.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>Will this gear ne'er be mended?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TROILUS</li>
  <li>The Greeks are strong and skilful to their strength,</li>
  <li>Fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant;</li>
  <li>But I am weaker than a woman's tear,</li>
  <li class="number">Tamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,</li>
  <li>Less valiant than the virgin in the night</li>
  <li>And skilless as unpractised infancy.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>Well, I have told you enough of this: for my part,</li>
  <li>I'll not meddle nor make no further. He that will</li>
  <li class="number">have a cake out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TROILUS</li>
  <li>Have I not tarried?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>Ay, the grinding; but you must tarry</li>
  <li>the bolting.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TROILUS</li>
  <li>Have I not tarried?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li class="number">Ay, the bolting, but you must tarry the leavening.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TROILUS</li>
  <li>Still have I tarried.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>Ay, to the leavening; but here's yet in the word</li>
  <li>'hereafter' the kneading, the making of the cake, the</li>
  <li>heating of the oven and the baking; nay, you must</li>
  <li class="number">stay the cooling too, or you may chance to burn your lips.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TROILUS</li>
  <li>Patience herself, what goddess e'er she be,</li>
  <li>Doth lesser blench at sufferance than I do.</li>
  <li>At Priam's royal table do I sit;</li>
  <li>And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts —  </li>
  <li class="number">So, traitor! 'When she comes!' When is she thence?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>Well, she looked yesternight fairer than ever I saw</li>
  <li>her look, or any woman else.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TROILUS</li>
  <li>I was about to tell thee: — when my heart,</li>
  <li>As wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,</li>
  <li class="number">Lest Hector or my father should perceive me,</li>
  <li>I have, as when the sun doth light a storm,</li>
  <li>Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile:</li>
  <li>But sorrow, that is couch'd in seeming gladness,</li>
  <li>Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li class="number">An her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen's — </li>
  <li>well, go to — there were no more comparison between</li>
  <li>the women: but, for my part, she is my kinswoman; I</li>
  <li>would not, as they term it, praise her: but I would</li>
  <li>somebody had heard her talk yesterday, as I did. I</li>
  <li class="number">will not dispraise your sister Cassandra's wit, but — </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TROILUS</li>
  <li>O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus —  </li>
  <li>When I do tell thee, there my hopes lie drown'd,</li>
  <li>Reply not in how many fathoms deep</li>
  <li>They lie indrench'd. I tell thee I am mad</li>
  <li class="number">In Cressid's love: thou answer'st 'she is fair;'</li>
  <li>Pour'st in the open ulcer of my heart</li>
  <li>Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,</li>
  <li>Handlest in thy discourse, O, that her hand,</li>
  <li>In whose comparison all whites are ink,</li>
  <li class="number">Writing their own reproach, to whose soft seizure</li>
  <li>The cygnet's down is harsh and spirit of sense</li>
  <li>Hard as the palm of ploughman: this thou tell'st me,</li>
  <li>As true thou tell'st me, when I say I love her;</li>
  <li>But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,</li>
  <li class="number">Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me</li>
  <li>The knife that made it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>I speak no more than truth.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TROILUS</li>
  <li>Thou dost not speak so much.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>Faith, I'll not meddle in't. Let her be as she is:</li>
  <li class="number">if she be fair, 'tis the better for her; an she be</li>
  <li>not, she has the mends in her own hands.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TROILUS</li>
  <li>Good Pandarus, how now, Pandarus!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>I have had my labour for my travail; ill-thought on of</li>
  <li>her and ill-thought on of you; gone between and</li>
  <li class="number">between, but small thanks for my labour.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TROILUS</li>
  <li>What, art thou angry, Pandarus? what, with me?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>Because she's kin to me, therefore she's not so fair</li>
  <li>as Helen: an she were not kin to me, she would be as</li>
  <li>fair on Friday as Helen is on Sunday. But what care</li>
  <li class="number">I? I care not an she were a black-a-moor; 'tis all one to me.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TROILUS</li>
  <li>Say I she is not fair?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>I do not care whether you do or no. She's a fool to</li>
  <li>stay behind her father; let her to the Greeks; and so</li>
  <li>I'll tell her the next time I see her: for my part,</li>
  <li class="number">I'll meddle nor make no more i' the matter.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TROILUS</li>
  <li>Pandarus —  </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>Not I.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TROILUS</li>
  <li>Sweet Pandarus —  </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>Pray you, speak no more to me: I will leave all as I</li>
  <li class="number">found it, and there an end.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit PANDARUS. An alarum</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TROILUS</li>
  <li>Peace, you ungracious clamours! peace, rude sounds!</li>
  <li>Fools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair,</li>
  <li>When with your blood you daily paint her thus.</li>
  <li>I cannot fight upon this argument;</li>
  <li class="number">It is too starved a subject for my sword.</li>
  <li>But Pandarus —  O gods, how do you plague me!</li>
  <li>I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar;</li>
  <li>And he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo.</li>
  <li>As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.</li>
  <li class="number">Tell me, Apollo, for thy Daphne's love,</li>
  <li>What Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we?</li>
  <li>Her bed is India; there she lies, a pearl:</li>
  <li>Between our Ilium and where she resides,</li>
  <li>Let it be call'd the wild and wandering flood,</li>
  <li class="number">Ourself the merchant, and this sailing Pandar</li>
  <li>Our doubtful hope, our convoy and our bark.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Alarum. Enter AENEAS</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AENEAS</li>
  <li>How now, Prince Troilus! wherefore not afield?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TROILUS</li>
  <li>Because not there: this woman's answer sorts,</li>
  <li>For womanish it is to be from thence.</li>
  <li class="number">What news, AEneas, from the field to-day?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AENEAS</li>
  <li>That Paris is returned home and hurt.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TROILUS</li>
  <li>By whom, AEneas?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AENEAS</li>
  <li>Troilus, by Menelaus.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TROILUS</li>
  <li>Let Paris bleed; 'tis but a scar to scorn;</li>
  <li class="number">Paris is gored with Menelaus' horn.</li>

  <li>Better at home, if 'would I might' were 'may.'</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  The Same. A street.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter CRESSIDA and ALEXANDER</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>Who were those went by?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ALEXANDER</li>
  <li>Queen Hecuba and Helen.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>And whither go they?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ALEXANDER</li>
  <li>Up to the eastern tower,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose height commands as subject all the vale,</li>
  <li>To see the battle. Hector, whose patience</li>
  <li>Is, as a virtue, fix'd, to-day was moved:</li>
  <li>He chid Andromache and struck his armourer,</li>
  <li>And, like as there were husbandry in war,</li>
  <li class="number">Before the sun rose he was harness'd light,</li>
  <li>And to the field goes he; where every flower</li>
  <li>Did, as a prophet, weep what it foresaw</li>
  <li>In Hector's wrath.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>What was his cause of anger?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ALEXANDER</li>
  <li class="number">The noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks</li>
  <li>A lord of Trojan blood, nephew to Hector;</li>
  <li>They call him Ajax.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>Good; and what of him?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ALEXANDER</li>
  <li>They say he is a very man per se,</li>
  <li class="number">And stands alone.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>So do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no legs.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ALEXANDER</li>
  <li>This man, lady, hath robbed many beasts of their</li>
  <li>particular additions; he is as valiant as the lion,</li>
  <li>churlish as the bear, slow as the elephant: a man</li>
  <li class="number">into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his</li>
  <li>valour is crushed into folly, his folly sauced with</li>
  <li>discretion: there is no man hath a virtue that he</li>
  <li>hath not a glimpse of, nor any man an attaint but he</li>
  <li>carries some stain of it: he is melancholy without</li>
  <li class="number">cause, and merry against the hair: he hath the</li>
  <li>joints of every thing, but everything so out of joint</li>
  <li>that he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and no use,</li>
  <li>or purblind Argus, all eyes and no sight.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>But how should this man, that makes</li>
  <li class="number">me smile, make Hector angry?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ALEXANDER</li>
  <li>They say he yesterday coped Hector in the battle and</li>
  <li>struck him down, the disdain and shame whereof hath</li>
  <li>ever since kept Hector fasting and waking.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>Who comes here?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ALEXANDER</li>
  <li class="number">Madam, your uncle Pandarus.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter PANDARUS</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>Hector's a gallant man.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ALEXANDER</li>
  <li>As may be in the world, lady.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>What's that? what's that?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>Good morrow, uncle Pandarus.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li class="number">Good morrow, cousin Cressid: what do you talk of?</li>
  <li>Good morrow, Alexander. How do you, cousin? When</li>
  <li>were you at Ilium?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>This morning, uncle.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>What were you talking of when I came? Was Hector</li>
  <li class="number">armed and gone ere ye came to Ilium? Helen was not</li>
  <li>up, was she?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>Hector was gone, but Helen was not up.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>Even so: Hector was stirring early.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>That were we talking of, and of his anger.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li class="number">Was he angry?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>So he says here.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>True, he was so: I know the cause too: he'll lay</li>
  <li>about him to-day, I can tell them that: and there's</li>
  <li>Troilus will not come far behind him: let them take</li>
  <li class="number">heed of Troilus, I can tell them that too.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>What, is he angry too?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>O Jupiter! there's no comparison.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>What, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know a</li>
  <li class="number">man if you see him?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>Well, I say Troilus is Troilus.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>Then you say as I say; for, I am sure, he is not Hector.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>No, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li class="number">'Tis just to each of them; he is himself.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>Himself! Alas, poor Troilus! I would he were.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>So he is.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>Condition, I had gone barefoot to India.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>He is not Hector.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li class="number">Himself! no, he's not himself: would a' were</li>
  <li>himself! Well, the gods are above; time must friend</li>
  <li>or end: well, Troilus, well: I would my heart were</li>
  <li>in her body. No, Hector is not a better man than Troilus.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>Excuse me.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li class="number">He is elder.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>Pardon me, pardon me.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>Th' other's not come to't; you shall tell me another</li>
  <li>tale, when th' other's come to't. Hector shall not</li>
  <li>have his wit this year.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li class="number">He shall not need it, if he have his own.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>Nor his qualities.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>No matter.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>Nor his beauty.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>'Twould not become him; his own's better.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li class="number">You have no judgment, niece: Helen</li>
  <li>herself swore th' other day, that Troilus, for</li>
  <li>a brown favour — for so 'tis, I must confess —  </li>
  <li>not brown neither —  </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>No, but brown.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li class="number">'Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>To say the truth, true and not true.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>She praised his complexion above Paris.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>Why, Paris hath colour enough.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>So he has.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li class="number">Then Troilus should have too much: if she praised</li>
  <li>him above, his complexion is higher than his; he</li>
  <li>having colour enough, and the other higher, is too</li>
  <li>flaming a praise for a good complexion. I had as</li>
  <li>lief Helen's golden tongue had commended Troilus for</li>
  <li class="number">a copper nose.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>I swear to you. I think Helen loves him better than Paris.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>Then she's a merry Greek indeed.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him th' other</li>
  <li>day into the compassed window —  and, you know, he</li>
  <li class="number">has not past three or four hairs on his chin —  </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>Indeed, a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring his</li>
  <li>particulars therein to a total.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>Why, he is very young: and yet will he, within</li>
  <li>three pound, lift as much as his brother Hector.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li class="number">Is he so young a man and so old a lifter?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came</li>
  <li>and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin — </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>Juno have mercy! how came it cloven?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>Why, you know 'tis dimpled: I think his smiling</li>
  <li class="number">becomes him better than any man in all Phrygia.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>O, he smiles valiantly.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>Does he not?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>O yes, an 'twere a cloud in autumn.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>Why, go to, then: but to prove to you that Helen</li>
  <li class="number">loves Troilus —  </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>Troilus will stand to the proof, if you'll</li>
  <li>prove it so.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>Troilus! why, he esteems her no more than I esteem</li>
  <li>an addle egg.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li class="number">If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle</li>
  <li>head, you would eat chickens i' the shell.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>I cannot choose but laugh, to think how she tickled</li>
  <li>his chin: indeed, she has a marvellous white hand, I</li>
  <li>must needs confess —  </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li class="number">Without the rack.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>Alas, poor chin! many a wart is richer.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>But there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba laughed</li>
  <li>that her eyes ran o'er.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li class="number">With mill-stones.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>And Cassandra laughed.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>But there was more temperate fire under the pot of</li>
  <li>her eyes: did her eyes run o'er too?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>And Hector laughed.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li class="number">At what was all this laughing?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>Marry, at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus' chin.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>An't had been a green hair, I should have laughed</li>
  <li>too.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>They laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li class="number">What was his answer?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>Quoth she, 'Here's but two and fifty hairs on your</li>
  <li>chin, and one of them is white.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>This is her question.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>That's true; make no question of that. 'Two and</li>
  <li class="number">fifty hairs' quoth he, 'and one white: that white</li>
  <li>hair is my father, and all the rest are his sons.'</li>
  <li>'Jupiter!' quoth she, 'which of these hairs is Paris,</li>
  <li>my husband? 'The forked one,' quoth he, 'pluck't</li>
  <li>out, and give it him.' But there was such laughing!</li>
  <li class="number">and Helen so blushed, an Paris so chafed, and all the</li>
  <li>rest so laughed, that it passed.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>So let it now; for it has been while going by.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>Well, cousin. I told you a thing yesterday; think on't.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>So I do.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li class="number">I'll be sworn 'tis true; he will weep you, an 'twere</li>
  <li>a man born in April.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>And I'll spring up in his tears, an 'twere a nettle</li>

<h3>SCENE III.  The Grecian camp. Before Agamemnon's tent.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Sennet. Enter AGAMEMNON, NESTOR, ULYSSES,
MENELAUS, and others</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AGAMEMNON</li>
  <li>Princes,</li>
  <li>What grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks?</li>
  <li>The ample proposition that hope makes</li>
  <li>In all designs begun on earth below</li>
  <li class="number">Fails in the promised largeness: cheques and disasters</li>
  <li>Grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd,</li>
  <li>As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,</li>
  <li>Infect the sound pine and divert his grain</li>
  <li>Tortive and errant from his course of growth.</li>
  <li class="number">Nor, princes, is it matter new to us</li>
  <li>That we come short of our suppose so far</li>
  <li>That after seven years' siege yet Troy walls stand;</li>
  <li>Sith every action that hath gone before,</li>
  <li>Whereof we have record, trial did draw</li>
  <li class="number">Bias and thwart, not answering the aim,</li>
  <li>And that unbodied figure of the thought</li>
  <li>That gave't surmised shape. Why then, you princes,</li>
  <li>Do you with cheeks abash'd behold our works,</li>
  <li>And call them shames? which are indeed nought else</li>
  <li class="number">But the protractive trials of great Jove</li>
  <li>To find persistive constancy in men:</li>
  <li>The fineness of which metal is not found</li>
  <li>In fortune's love; for then the bold and coward,</li>
  <li>The wise and fool, the artist and unread,</li>
  <li class="number">The hard and soft seem all affined and kin:</li>
  <li>But, in the wind and tempest of her frown,</li>
  <li>Distinction, with a broad and powerful fan,</li>
  <li>Puffing at all, winnows the light away;</li>
  <li>And what hath mass or matter, by itself</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NESTOR</li>
  <li>With due observance of thy godlike seat,</li>
  <li>Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply</li>
  <li>Thy latest words. In the reproof of chance</li>
  <li>Lies the true proof of men: the sea being smooth,</li>
  <li class="number">How many shallow bauble boats dare sail</li>
  <li>Upon her patient breast, making their way</li>
  <li>With those of nobler bulk!</li>
  <li>But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage</li>
  <li>The gentle Thetis, and anon behold</li>
  <li class="number">The strong-ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut,</li>
  <li>Bounding between the two moist elements,</li>
  <li>Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boat</li>
  <li>Whose weak untimber'd sides but even now</li>
  <li>Co-rivall'd greatness? Either to harbour fled,</li>
  <li class="number">Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so</li>
  <li>Doth valour's show and valour's worth divide</li>
  <li>In storms of fortune; for in her ray and brightness</li>
  <li>The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze</li>
  <li>Than by the tiger; but when the splitting wind</li>
  <li class="number">Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,</li>
  <li>And flies fled under shade, why, then the thing of courage</li>
  <li>As roused with rage with rage doth sympathize,</li>
  <li>And with an accent tuned in selfsame key</li>
  <li>Retorts to chiding fortune.</li>

  <li>Office and custom, in all line of order;</li>
  <li class="number">And therefore is the glorious planet Sol</li>
  <li>In noble eminence enthroned and sphered</li>

  <li>Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil,</li>
  <li>And posts, like the commandment of a king,</li>

  <li>Commotion in the winds! frights, changes, horrors,</li>
  <li class="number">Divert and crack, rend and deracinate</li>
  <li>The unity and married calm of states</li>
  <li>Quite from their fixure! O, when degree is shaked,</li>
  <li>Which is the ladder to all high designs,</li>
  <li>Then enterprise is sick! How could communities,</li>
  <li class="number">Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities,</li>
  <li>Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,</li>
  <li>The primogenitive and due of birth,</li>
  <li>Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,</li>
  <li>But by degree, stand in authentic place?</li>
  <li class="number">Take but degree away, untune that string,</li>
  <li>And, hark, what discord follows! each thing meets</li>
  <li>In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters</li>
  <li>Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores</li>
  <li>And make a sop of all this solid globe:</li>
  <li class="number">Strength should be lord of imbecility,</li>
  <li>And the rude son should strike his father dead:</li>
  <li>Force should be right; or rather, right and wrong,</li>
  <li>Between whose endless jar justice resides,</li>
  <li>Should lose their names, and so should justice too.</li>
  <li class="number">Then every thing includes itself in power,</li>
  <li>Power into will, will into appetite;</li>
  <li>And appetite, an universal wolf,</li>
  <li>So doubly seconded with will and power,</li>
  <li>Must make perforce an universal prey,</li>
  <li class="number">And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,</li>
  <li>This chaos, when degree is suffocate,</li>
  <li>Follows the choking.</li>
  <li>And this neglection of degree it is</li>
  <li>That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose</li>
  <li class="number">It hath to climb. The general's disdain'd</li>
  <li>By him one step below, he by the next,</li>
  <li>That next by him beneath; so every step,</li>
  <li>Exampled by the first pace that is sick</li>
  <li>Of his superior, grows to an envious fever</li>
  <li class="number">Of pale and bloodless emulation:</li>
  <li>And 'tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,</li>
  <li>Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,</li>
  <li>Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NESTOR</li>
  <li>Most wisely hath Ulysses here discover'd</li>
  <li class="number">The fever whereof all our power is sick.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AGAMEMNON</li>
  <li>The nature of the sickness found, Ulysses,</li>
  <li>What is the remedy?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ULYSSES</li>
  <li>The great Achilles, whom opinion crowns</li>
  <li>The sinew and the forehand of our host,</li>
  <li class="number">Having his ear full of his airy fame,</li>
  <li>Grows dainty of his worth, and in his tent</li>
  <li>Lies mocking our designs: with him Patroclus</li>
  <li>Upon a lazy bed the livelong day</li>
  <li>Breaks scurril jests;</li>
  <li class="number">And with ridiculous and awkward action,</li>
  <li>Which, slanderer, he imitation calls,</li>
  <li>He pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,</li>
  <li>Thy topless deputation he puts on,</li>
  <li>And, like a strutting player, whose conceit</li>
  <li class="number">Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich</li>
  <li>To hear the wooden dialogue and sound</li>
  <li>'Twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage —  </li>
  <li>Such to-be-pitied and o'er-wrested seeming</li>
  <li>He acts thy greatness in: and when he speaks,</li>
  <li class="number">'Tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquared,</li>
  <li>Which, from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp'd</li>
  <li>Would seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff</li>
  <li>The large Achilles, on his press'd bed lolling,</li>
  <li>From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause;</li>
  <li class="number">Cries 'Excellent! 'tis Agamemnon just.</li>
  <li>Now play me Nestor; hem, and stroke thy beard,</li>
  <li>As he being drest to some oration.'</li>
  <li>That's done, as near as the extremest ends</li>
  <li>Of parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife:</li>
  <li class="number">Yet god Achilles still cries 'Excellent!</li>
  <li>'Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,</li>
  <li>Arming to answer in a night alarm.'</li>
  <li>And then, forsooth, the faint defects of age</li>
  <li>Must be the scene of mirth; to cough and spit,</li>
  <li class="number">And, with a palsy-fumbling on his gorget,</li>
  <li>Shake in and out the rivet: and at this sport</li>
  <li>Sir Valour dies; cries 'O, enough, Patroclus;</li>
  <li>Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all</li>
  <li>In pleasure of my spleen.' And in this fashion,</li>
  <li class="number">All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,</li>
  <li>Severals and generals of grace exact,</li>
  <li>Achievements, plots, orders, preventions,</li>
  <li>Excitements to the field, or speech for truce,</li>
  <li>Success or loss, what is or is not, serves</li>
  <li class="number">As stuff for these two to make paradoxes.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NESTOR</li>
  <li>And in the imitation of these twain — </li>
  <li>Who, as Ulysses says, opinion crowns</li>
  <li>With an imperial voice — many are infect.</li>
  <li>Ajax is grown self-will'd, and bears his head</li>
  <li class="number">In such a rein, in full as proud a place</li>
  <li>As broad Achilles; keeps his tent like him;</li>
  <li>Makes factious feasts; rails on our state of war,</li>
  <li>Bold as an oracle, and sets Thersites,</li>
  <li>A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,</li>
  <li class="number">To match us in comparisons with dirt,</li>
  <li>To weaken and discredit our exposure,</li>
  <li>How rank soever rounded in with danger.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ULYSSES</li>
  <li>They tax our policy, and call it cowardice,</li>
  <li>Count wisdom as no member of the war,</li>
  <li class="number">Forestall prescience, and esteem no act</li>
  <li>But that of hand: the still and mental parts,</li>
  <li>That do contrive how many hands shall strike,</li>
  <li>When fitness calls them on, and know by measure</li>
  <li>Of their observant toil the enemies' weight —  </li>
  <li class="number">Why, this hath not a finger's dignity:</li>
  <li>They call this bed-work, mappery, closet-war;</li>
  <li>So that the ram that batters down the wall,</li>
  <li>For the great swing and rudeness of his poise,</li>
  <li>They place before his hand that made the engine,</li>
  <li class="number">Or those that with the fineness of their souls</li>
  <li>By reason guide his execution.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NESTOR</li>

  <li>If there be one among the fair'st of Greece</li>
  <li>That holds his honour higher than his ease,</li>

  <li>That knows his valour, and knows not his fear,</li>

  <li>Hector, in view of Trojans and of Greeks,</li>
  <li class="number">Shall make it good, or do his best to do it,</li>
  <li>He hath a lady, wiser, fairer, truer,</li>
  <li>Than ever Greek did compass in his arms,</li>

  <li>Midway between your tents and walls of Troy,</li>
  <li class="number">To rouse a Grecian that is true in love:</li>
  <li>If any come, Hector shall honour him;</li>
  <li>If none, he'll say in Troy when he retires,</li>
  <li>The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth</li>
  <li>The splinter of a lance. Even so much.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">

  <li class="number">If then one is, or hath, or means to be,</li>
  <li>That one meets Hector; if none else, I am he.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NESTOR</li>

  <li>When Hector's grandsire suck'd: he is old now;</li>
  <li>But if there be not in our Grecian host</li>
  <li class="number">One noble man that hath one spark of fire,</li>
  <li>To answer for his love, tell him from me</li>
  <li>I'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver</li>
  <li>And in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn,</li>
  <li>And meeting him will tell him that my lady</li>

  <li>What says Ulysses?</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ULYSSES</li>

  <li class="number">What is't?</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ULYSSES</li>
  <li>This 'tis:</li>
  <li>Blunt wedges rive hard knots: the seeded pride</li>
  <li>That hath to this maturity blown up</li>
  <li>In rank Achilles must or now be cropp'd,</li>
  <li class="number">Or, shedding, breed a nursery of like evil,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NESTOR</li>
  <li>Well, and how?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ULYSSES</li>
  <li>This challenge that the gallant Hector sends,</li>
  <li>However it is spread in general name,</li>
  <li class="number">Relates in purpose only to Achilles.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NESTOR</li>
  <li>The purpose is perspicuous even as substance,</li>
  <li>Whose grossness little characters sum up:</li>
  <li>And, in the publication, make no strain,</li>
  <li>But that Achilles, were his brain as barren</li>
  <li class="number">As banks of Libya —  though, Apollo knows,</li>
  <li>'Tis dry enough —  will, with great speed of judgment,</li>
  <li>Ay, with celerity, find Hector's purpose</li>
  <li>Pointing on him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ULYSSES</li>
  <li>And wake him to the answer, think you?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NESTOR</li>
  <li class="number">Yes, 'tis most meet: whom may you else oppose,</li>
  <li>That can from Hector bring his honour off,</li>
  <li>If not Achilles? Though't be a sportful combat,</li>
  <li>Yet in the trial much opinion dwells;</li>
  <li>For here the Trojans taste our dear'st repute</li>
  <li class="number">With their finest palate: and trust to me, Ulysses,</li>
  <li>Our imputation shall be oddly poised</li>
  <li>In this wild action; for the success,</li>
  <li>Although particular, shall give a scantling</li>
  <li>Of good or bad unto the general;</li>
  <li class="number">And in such indexes, although small pricks</li>
  <li>To their subsequent volumes, there is seen</li>
  <li>The baby figure of the giant mass</li>
  <li>Of things to come at large. It is supposed</li>
  <li>He that meets Hector issues from our choice</li>
  <li class="number">And choice, being mutual act of all our souls,</li>
  <li>Makes merit her election, and doth boil,</li>
  <li>As 'twere from us all, a man distill'd</li>
  <li>Out of our virtues; who miscarrying,</li>
  <li>What heart receives from hence the conquering part,</li>
  <li class="number">To steel a strong opinion to themselves?</li>
  <li>Which entertain'd, limbs are his instruments,</li>
  <li>In no less working than are swords and bows</li>
  <li>Directive by the limbs.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ULYSSES</li>
  <li>Give pardon to my speech:</li>
  <li class="number">Therefore 'tis meet Achilles meet not Hector.</li>
  <li>Let us, like merchants, show our foulest wares,</li>
  <li>And think, perchance, they'll sell; if not,</li>
  <li>The lustre of the better yet to show,</li>
  <li>Shall show the better. Do not consent</li>
  <li class="number">That ever Hector and Achilles meet;</li>
  <li>For both our honour and our shame in this</li>
  <li>Are dogg'd with two strange followers.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NESTOR</li>
  <li>I see them not with my old eyes: what are they?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ULYSSES</li>
  <li>What glory our Achilles shares from Hector,</li>
  <li class="number">Were he not proud, we all should share with him:</li>
  <li>But he already is too insolent;</li>
  <li>And we were better parch in Afric sun</li>
  <li>Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes,</li>
  <li>Should he 'scape Hector fair: if he were foil'd,</li>
  <li class="number">Why then, we did our main opinion crush</li>
  <li>In taint of our best man. No, make a lottery;</li>
  <li>And, by device, let blockish Ajax draw</li>
  <li>The sort to fight with Hector: among ourselves</li>
  <li>Give him allowance for the better man;</li>
  <li class="number">For that will physic the great Myrmidon</li>
  <li>Who broils in loud applause, and make him fall</li>
  <li>His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.</li>
  <li>If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,</li>
  <li>We'll dress him up in voices: if he fail,</li>
  <li class="number">Yet go we under our opinion still</li>
  <li>That we have better men. But, hit or miss,</li>
  <li>Our project's life this shape of sense assumes:</li>
  <li>Ajax employ'd plucks down Achilles' plumes.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NESTOR</li>
  <li>Ulysses,</li>
  <li class="number">Now I begin to relish thy advice;</li>
  <li>And I will give a taste of it forthwith</li>
  <li>To Agamemnon: go we to him straight.</li>
  <li>Two curs shall tame each other: pride alone</li>
  <li>Must tarre the mastiffs on, as 'twere their bone.</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  Troy. A room in Priam's palace.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter PRIAM, HECTOR, TROILUS, PARIS, and HELENUS</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRIAM</li>
  <li>After so many hours, lives, speeches spent,</li>
  <li>Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks:</li>
  <li>'Deliver Helen, and all damage else — </li>
  <li>As honour, loss of time, travail, expense,</li>
  <li class="number">Wounds, friends, and what else dear that is consumed</li>
  <li>In hot digestion of this cormorant war — </li>
  <li>Shall be struck off.' Hector, what say you to't?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HECTOR</li>
  <li>Though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I</li>
  <li>As far as toucheth my particular,</li>
  <li class="number">Yet, dread Priam,</li>
  <li>There is no lady of more softer bowels,</li>
  <li>More spongy to suck in the sense of fear,</li>
  <li>More ready to cry out 'Who knows what follows?'</li>
  <li>Than Hector is: the wound of peace is surety,</li>
  <li class="number">Surety secure; but modest doubt is call'd</li>
  <li>The beacon of the wise, the tent that searches</li>
  <li>To the bottom of the worst. Let Helen go:</li>
  <li>Since the first sword was drawn about this question,</li>
  <li>Every tithe soul, 'mongst many thousand dismes,</li>
  <li class="number">Hath been as dear as Helen; I mean, of ours:</li>
  <li>If we have lost so many tenths of ours,</li>
  <li>To guard a thing not ours nor worth to us,</li>
  <li>Had it our name, the value of one ten,</li>
  <li>What merit's in that reason which denies</li>
  <li class="number">The yielding of her up?</li>

  <li>Fie, fie, my brother!</li>

  <li class="number">The past proportion of his infinite?</li>
  <li>And buckle in a waist most fathomless</li>
  <li>With spans and inches so diminutive</li>
  <li>As fears and reasons? fie, for godly shame!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HELENUS</li>
  <li>No marvel, though you bite so sharp at reasons,</li>

  <li>Because your speech hath none that tells him so?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TROILUS</li>
  <li>You are for dreams and slumbers, brother priest;</li>
  <li>You fur your gloves with reason. Here are</li>
  <li class="number">your reasons:</li>
  <li>You know an enemy intends you harm;</li>
  <li>You know a sword employ'd is perilous,</li>
  <li>And reason flies the object of all harm:</li>
  <li>Who marvels then, when Helenus beholds</li>
  <li class="number">A Grecian and his sword, if he do set</li>
  <li>The very wings of reason to his heels</li>
  <li>And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove,</li>
  <li>Or like a star disorb'd? Nay, if we talk of reason,</li>
  <li>Let's shut our gates and sleep: manhood and honour</li>
  <li class="number">Should have hare-hearts, would they but fat</li>

  <li class="number">Although my will distaste what it elected,</li>
  <li>The wife I chose? there can be no evasion</li>
  <li>To blench from this and to stand firm by honour:</li>
  <li>We turn not back the silks upon the merchant,</li>
  <li>When we have soil'd them, nor the remainder viands</li>
  <li class="number">We do not throw in unrespective sieve,</li>
  <li>Because we now are full. It was thought meet</li>
  <li>Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks:</li>
  <li>Your breath of full consent bellied his sails;</li>
  <li>The seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truce</li>
  <li class="number">And did him service: he touch'd the ports desired,</li>
  <li>And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive,</li>
  <li>He brought a Grecian queen, whose youth and freshness</li>
  <li>Wrinkles Apollo's, and makes stale the morning.</li>
  <li>Why keep we her? the Grecians keep our aunt:</li>
  <li class="number">Is she worth keeping? why, she is a pearl,</li>
  <li>Whose price hath launch'd above a thousand ships,</li>
  <li>And turn'd crown'd kings to merchants.</li>
  <li>If you'll avouch 'twas wisdom Paris went — </li>
  <li>As you must needs, for you all cried 'Go, go,' — </li>
  <li class="number">If you'll confess he brought home noble prize — </li>

  <li>And cried 'Inestimable!' — why do you now</li>
  <li>The issue of your proper wisdoms rate,</li>

  <li>Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base,</li>

  <li>Such things as might offend the weakest spleen</li>

  <li>Else might the world convince of levity</li>

  <li>Gave wings to my propension and cut off</li>
  <li class="number">All fears attending on so dire a project.</li>
  <li>For what, alas, can these my single arms?</li>
  <li>What Propugnation is in one man's valour,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PARIS</li>
  <li>Sir, I propose not merely to myself</li>
  <li>The pleasures such a beauty brings with it;</li>
  <li class="number">But I would have the soil of her fair rape</li>
  <li>Wiped off, in honourable keeping her.</li>
  <li>What treason were it to the ransack'd queen,</li>
  <li>Disgrace to your great worths and shame to me,</li>
  <li>Now to deliver her possession up</li>
  <li class="number">On terms of base compulsion! Can it be</li>
  <li>That so degenerate a strain as this</li>

  <li>There's not the meanest spirit on our party</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HECTOR</li>
  <li class="number">Paris and Troilus, you have both said well,</li>
  <li>And on the cause and question now in hand</li>
  <li>Have glozed, but superficially: not much</li>
  <li>Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought</li>
  <li>Unfit to hear moral philosophy:</li>
  <li class="number">The reasons you allege do more conduce</li>
  <li>To the hot passion of distemper'd blood</li>
  <li>Than to make up a free determination</li>
  <li>'Twixt right and wrong, for pleasure and revenge</li>
  <li>Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice</li>
  <li class="number">Of any true decision. Nature craves</li>
  <li>All dues be render'd to their owners: now,</li>
  <li>What nearer debt in all humanity</li>
  <li>Than wife is to the husband? If this law</li>
  <li>Of nature be corrupted through affection,</li>
  <li class="number">And that great minds, of partial indulgence</li>
  <li>To their benumbed wills, resist the same,</li>
  <li>There is a law in each well-order'd nation</li>
  <li>To curb those raging appetites that are</li>
  <li>Most disobedient and refractory.</li>
  <li class="number">If Helen then be wife to Sparta's king,</li>
  <li>As it is known she is, these moral laws</li>
  <li>Of nature and of nations speak aloud</li>
  <li>To have her back return'd: thus to persist</li>
  <li>In doing wrong extenuates not wrong,</li>
  <li class="number">But makes it much more heavy. Hector's opinion</li>
  <li>Is this in way of truth; yet ne'ertheless,</li>
  <li>My spritely brethren, I propend to you</li>
  <li>In resolution to keep Helen still,</li>
  <li>For 'tis a cause that hath no mean dependance</li>
  <li class="number">Upon our joint and several dignities.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TROILUS</li>
  <li>Why, there you touch'd the life of our design:</li>
  <li>Were it not glory that we more affected</li>
  <li>Than the performance of our heaving spleens,</li>
  <li>I would not wish a drop of Trojan blood</li>
  <li class="number">Spent more in her defence. But, worthy Hector,</li>
  <li>She is a theme of honour and renown,</li>
  <li>A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,</li>
  <li>Whose present courage may beat down our foes,</li>
  <li>And fame in time to come canonize us;</li>
  <li class="number">For, I presume, brave Hector would not lose</li>
  <li>So rich advantage of a promised glory</li>
  <li>As smiles upon the forehead of this action</li>
  <li>For the wide world's revenue.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">

  <li>I have a roisting challenge sent amongst</li>

  <li class="number">whilst he railed at me. 'Sfoot, I'll learn to</li>

  <li>my spiteful execrations. Then there's Achilles, a</li>
  <li>rare enginer! If Troy be not taken till these two</li>

  <li>scarce, it will not in circumvention deliver a fly</li>

  <li>whole camp! or rather, the bone-ache! for that,</li>

  <li>for a placket. I have said my prayers and devil Envy</li>

  <li>Prince Troilus, I have loved you night and day</li>
  <li class="number">For many weary months.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TROILUS</li>
  <li>Why was my Cressid then so hard to win?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>Hard to seem won: but I was won, my lord,</li>
  <li>With the first glance that ever — pardon me — </li>
  <li>If I confess much, you will play the tyrant.</li>
  <li class="number">I love you now; but not, till now, so much</li>
  <li>But I might master it: in faith, I lie;</li>
  <li>My thoughts were like unbridled children, grown</li>
  <li>Too headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!</li>
  <li>Why have I blabb'd? who shall be true to us,</li>
  <li class="number">When we are so unsecret to ourselves?</li>
  <li>But, though I loved you well, I woo'd you not;</li>
  <li>And yet, good faith, I wish'd myself a man,</li>
  <li>Or that we women had men's privilege</li>
  <li>Of speaking first. Sweet, bid me hold my tongue,</li>
  <li class="number">For in this rapture I shall surely speak</li>
  <li>The thing I shall repent. See, see, your silence,</li>
  <li>Cunning in dumbness, from my weakness draws</li>
  <li>My very soul of counsel! stop my mouth.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TROILUS</li>
  <li>And shall, albeit sweet music issues thence.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li class="number">Pretty, i' faith.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>My lord, I do beseech you, pardon me;</li>
  <li>'Twas not my purpose, thus to beg a kiss:</li>
  <li>I am ashamed. O heavens! what have I done?</li>
  <li>For this time will I take my leave, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TROILUS</li>
  <li class="number">Your leave, sweet Cressid!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>Leave! an you take leave till to-morrow morning —  </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>Pray you, content you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TROILUS</li>
  <li>What offends you, lady?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>Sir, mine own company.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TROILUS</li>
  <li class="number">You cannot shun Yourself.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>Let me go and try:</li>
  <li>I have a kind of self resides with you;</li>
  <li>But an unkind self, that itself will leave,</li>
  <li>To be another's fool. I would be gone:</li>
  <li class="number">Where is my wit? I know not what I speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TROILUS</li>
  <li>Well know they what they speak that speak so wisely.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>Perchance, my lord, I show more craft than love;</li>
  <li>And fell so roundly to a large confession,</li>
  <li>To angle for your thoughts: but you are wise,</li>
  <li class="number">Or else you love not, for to be wise and love</li>
  <li>Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TROILUS</li>
  <li>O that I thought it could be in a woman — </li>
  <li>As, if it can, I will presume in you — </li>
  <li>To feed for aye her ramp and flames of love;</li>
  <li class="number">To keep her constancy in plight and youth,</li>
  <li>Outliving beauty's outward, with a mind</li>
  <li>That doth renew swifter than blood decays!</li>
  <li>Or that persuasion could but thus convince me,</li>
  <li>That my integrity and truth to you</li>
  <li class="number">Might be affronted with the match and weight</li>
  <li>Of such a winnow'd purity in love;</li>
  <li>How were I then uplifted! but, alas!</li>
  <li>I am as true as truth's simplicity</li>
  <li>And simpler than the infancy of truth.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li class="number">In that I'll war with you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TROILUS</li>
  <li>O virtuous fight,</li>
  <li>When right with right wars who shall be most right!</li>
  <li>True swains in love shall in the world to come</li>
  <li>Approve their truths by Troilus: when their rhymes,</li>
  <li class="number">Full of protest, of oath and big compare,</li>
  <li>Want similes, truth tired with iteration,</li>
  <li>As true as steel, as plantage to the moon,</li>
  <li>As sun to day, as turtle to her mate,</li>
  <li>As iron to adamant, as earth to the centre,</li>
  <li class="number">Yet, after all comparisons of truth,</li>
  <li>As truth's authentic author to be cited,</li>
  <li>'As true as Troilus' shall crown up the verse,</li>
  <li>And sanctify the numbers.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>Prophet may you be!</li>
  <li class="number">If I be false, or swerve a hair from truth,</li>
  <li>When time is old and hath forgot itself,</li>
  <li>When waterdrops have worn the stones of Troy,</li>
  <li>And blind oblivion swallow'd cities up,</li>
  <li>And mighty states characterless are grated</li>
  <li class="number">To dusty nothing, yet let memory,</li>
  <li>From false to false, among false maids in love,</li>
  <li>Upbraid my falsehood! when they've said 'as false</li>
  <li>As air, as water, wind, or sandy earth,</li>
  <li>As fox to lamb, as wolf to heifer's calf,</li>
  <li class="number">Pard to the hind, or stepdame to her son,'</li>
  <li>'Yea,' let them say, to stick the heart of falsehood,</li>
  <li>'As false as Cressid.'</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>Go to, a bargain made: seal it, seal it; I'll be the</li>
  <li>witness. Here I hold your hand, here my cousin's.</li>
  <li class="number">If ever you prove false one to another, since I have</li>
  <li>taken such pains to bring you together, let all</li>
  <li>pitiful goers-between be called to the world's end</li>
  <li>after my name; call them all Pandars; let all</li>
  <li>constant men be Troiluses, all false women Cressids,</li>
  <li class="number">and all brokers-between Pandars! say, amen.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">TROILUS</li>
  <li>Amen.</li>

  <li class="speaker">CRESSIDA</li>
  <li>Amen.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PANDARUS</li>
  <li>Amen. Whereupon I will show you a chamber with a</li>
  <li>bed; which bed, because it shall not speak of your</li>
  <li class="number">pretty encounters, press it to death: away!</li>
  <li>And Cupid grant all tongue-tied maidens here</li>
  <li>Bed, chamber, Pandar to provide this gear!</li>

  <li class="speaker">CALCHAS</li>
  <li>Now, princes, for the service I have done you,</li>
  <li>The advantage of the time prompts me aloud</li>
  <li>To call for recompense. Appear it to your mind</li>
  <li>That, through the sight I bear in things to love,</li>
  <li class="number">I have abandon'd Troy, left my possession,</li>
  <li>Incurr'd a traitor's name; exposed myself,</li>
  <li>From certain and possess'd conveniences,</li>
  <li>To doubtful fortunes; sequestering from me all</li>
  <li>That time, acquaintance, custom and condition</li>
  <li class="number">Made tame and most familiar to my nature,</li>
  <li>And here, to do you service, am become</li>
  <li>As new into the world, strange, unacquainted:</li>
  <li>I do beseech you, as in way of taste,</li>
  <li>To give me now a little benefit,</li>
  <li class="number">Out of those many register'd in promise,</li>

  <li class="speaker">AGAMEMNON</li>
  <li>What wouldst thou of us, Trojan? make demand.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">CALCHAS</li>
  <li>You have a Trojan prisoner, call'd Antenor,</li>
  <li>Yesterday took: Troy holds him very dear.</li>
  <li class="number">Oft have you — often have you thanks therefore — </li>
  <li>Desired my Cressid in right great exchange,</li>
  <li>Whom Troy hath still denied: but this Antenor,</li>
  <li>I know, is such a wrest in their affairs</li>
  <li>That their negotiations all must slack,</li>
  <li class="number">Wanting his manage; and they will almost</li>
  <li>Give us a prince of blood, a son of Priam,</li>
  <li>In change of him: let him be sent, great princes,</li>
  <li>And he shall buy my daughter; and her presence</li>
  <li>Shall quite strike off all service I have done,</li>
  <li class="number">In most accepted pain.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AGAMEMNON</li>
  <li>Let Diomedes bear him,</li>
  <li>And bring us Cressid hither: Calchas shall have</li>
  <li>What he requests of us. Good Diomed,</li>
  <li>Furnish you fairly for this interchange:</li>

  <li>Be answer'd in his challenge: Ajax is ready.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ULYSSES</li>
  <li>Achilles stands i' the entrance of his tent:</li>
  <li class="number">Please it our general to pass strangely by him,</li>
  <li>As if he were forgot; and, princes all,</li>
  <li>Lay negligent and loose regard upon him:</li>
  <li>I will come last. 'Tis like he'll question me</li>
  <li>Why such unplausive eyes are bent on him:</li>
  <li class="number">If so, I have derision medicinable,</li>
  <li>To use between your strangeness and his pride,</li>
  <li>Which his own will shall have desire to drink:</li>
  <li>It may be good: pride hath no other glass</li>
  <li>To show itself but pride, for supple knees</li>
  <li class="number">Feed arrogance and are the proud man's fees.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AGAMEMNON</li>
  <li>We'll execute your purpose, and put on</li>
  <li>A form of strangeness as we pass along:</li>
  <li>So do each lord, and either greet him not,</li>
  <li>Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him more</li>
  <li class="number">Than if not look'd on. I will lead the way.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ACHILLES</li>
  <li>What, comes the general to speak with me?</li>
  <li>You know my mind, I'll fight no more 'gainst Troy.</li>

  <li>What mean these fellows? Know they not Achilles?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PATROCLUS</li>
  <li>They pass by strangely: they were used to bend</li>
  <li>To send their smiles before them to Achilles;</li>
  <li>To come as humbly as they used to creep</li>
  <li class="number">To holy altars.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ACHILLES</li>
  <li>What, am I poor of late?</li>
  <li>'Tis certain, greatness, once fall'n out with fortune,</li>
  <li>Must fall out with men too: what the declined is</li>
  <li>He shall as soon read in the eyes of others</li>
  <li class="number">As feel in his own fall; for men, like butterflies,</li>
  <li>Show not their mealy wings but to the summer,</li>
  <li>And not a man, for being simply man,</li>
  <li>Hath any honour, but honour for those honours</li>
  <li>That are without him, as place, riches, favour,</li>
  <li class="number">Prizes of accident as oft as merit:</li>
  <li>Which when they fall, as being slippery standers,</li>
  <li>The love that lean'd on them as slippery too,</li>
  <li>Do one pluck down another and together</li>
  <li>Die in the fall. But 'tis not so with me:</li>
  <li class="number">Fortune and I are friends: I do enjoy</li>
  <li>At ample point all that I did possess,</li>
  <li>Save these men's looks; who do, methinks, find out</li>
  <li>Something not worth in me such rich beholding</li>
  <li>As they have often given. Here is Ulysses;</li>
  <li class="number">I'll interrupt his reading.</li>
  <li>How now Ulysses!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ULYSSES</li>
  <li>Now, great Thetis' son!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ACHILLES</li>
  <li>What are you reading?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ULYSSES</li>
  <li>A strange fellow here</li>
  <li class="number">Writes me: 'That man, how dearly ever parted,</li>
  <li>How much in having, or without or in,</li>
  <li>Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,</li>
  <li>Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection;</li>
  <li>As when his virtues shining upon others</li>
  <li class="number">Heat them and they retort that heat again</li>
  <li>To the first giver.'</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ACHILLES</li>
  <li>This is not strange, Ulysses.</li>
  <li>The beauty that is borne here in the face</li>
  <li>The bearer knows not, but commends itself</li>
  <li class="number">To others' eyes; nor doth the eye itself,</li>
  <li>That most pure spirit of sense, behold itself,</li>
  <li>Not going from itself; but eye to eye opposed</li>
  <li>Salutes each other with each other's form;</li>
  <li>For speculation turns not to itself,</li>
  <li class="number">Till it hath travell'd and is mirror'd there</li>
  <li>Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ULYSSES</li>
  <li>I do not strain at the position —  </li>
  <li>It is familiar —  but at the author's drift;</li>
  <li>Who, in his circumstance, expressly proves</li>
  <li class="number">That no man is the lord of any thing,</li>
  <li>Though in and of him there be much consisting,</li>
  <li>Till he communicate his parts to others:</li>
  <li>Nor doth he of himself know them for aught</li>
  <li>Till he behold them form'd in the applause</li>
  <li class="number">Where they're extended; who, like an arch,</li>
  <li>reverberates</li>
  <li>The voice again, or, like a gate of steel</li>
  <li>Fronting the sun, receives and renders back</li>
  <li>His figure and his heat.  I was much wrapt in this;</li>
  <li class="number">And apprehended here immediately</li>
  <li>The unknown Ajax.</li>
  <li>Heavens, what a man is there! a very horse,</li>
  <li>That has he knows not what. Nature, what things there are</li>
  <li>Most abject in regard and dear in use!</li>
  <li class="number">What things again most dear in the esteem</li>
  <li>And poor in worth! Now shall we see to-morrow — </li>
  <li>An act that very chance doth throw upon him — </li>
  <li>Ajax renown'd. O heavens, what some men do,</li>
  <li>While some men leave to do!</li>
  <li class="number">How some men creep in skittish fortune's hall,</li>
  <li>Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!</li>
  <li>How one man eats into another's pride,</li>
  <li>While pride is fasting in his wantonness!</li>
  <li>To see these Grecian lords! — why, even already</li>
  <li class="number">They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,</li>
  <li>As if his foot were on brave Hector's breast</li>
  <li>And great Troy shrieking.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ACHILLES</li>
  <li>I do believe it; for they pass'd by me</li>
  <li>As misers do by beggars, neither gave to me</li>
  <li class="number">Good word nor look: what, are my deeds forgot?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ULYSSES</li>
  <li>Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,</li>
  <li>Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,</li>
  <li>A great-sized monster of ingratitudes:</li>
  <li>Those scraps are good deeds past; which are devour'd</li>
  <li class="number">As fast as they are made, forgot as soon</li>
  <li>As done: perseverance, dear my lord,</li>
  <li>Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hang</li>
  <li>Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail</li>
  <li>In monumental mockery. Take the instant way;</li>
  <li class="number">For honour travels in a strait so narrow,</li>
  <li>Where one but goes abreast: keep then the path;</li>
  <li>For emulation hath a thousand sons</li>
  <li>That one by one pursue: if you give way,</li>
  <li>Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,</li>
  <li class="number">Like to an enter'd tide, they all rush by</li>
  <li>And leave you hindmost;</li>
  <li>Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,</li>
  <li>Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,</li>
  <li>O'er-run and trampled on: then what they do in present,</li>
  <li class="number">Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours;</li>
  <li>For time is like a fashionable host</li>
  <li>That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,</li>
  <li>And with his arms outstretch'd, as he would fly,</li>
  <li>Grasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles,</li>
  <li class="number">And farewell goes out sighing. O, let not</li>
  <li>virtue seek</li>
  <li>Remuneration for the thing it was;</li>
  <li>For beauty, wit,</li>
  <li>High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,</li>
  <li class="number">Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all</li>
  <li>To envious and calumniating time.</li>
  <li>One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,</li>
  <li>That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,</li>
  <li>Though they are made and moulded of things past,</li>
  <li class="number">And give to dust that is a little gilt</li>
  <li>More laud than gilt o'er-dusted.</li>
  <li>The present eye praises the present object.</li>
  <li>Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,</li>
  <li>That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax;</li>
  <li class="number">Since things in motion sooner catch the eye</li>
  <li>Than what not stirs. The cry went once on thee,</li>
  <li>And still it might, and yet it may again,</li>
  <li>If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive</li>
  <li>And case thy reputation in thy tent;</li>
  <li class="number">Whose glorious deeds, but in these fields of late,</li>
  <li>Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselves</li>
  <li>And drave great Mars to faction.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ACHILLES</li>
  <li>Of this my privacy</li>
  <li>I have strong reasons.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ULYSSES</li>
  <li class="number">But 'gainst your privacy</li>
  <li>The reasons are more potent and heroical:</li>

  <li>With one of Priam's daughters.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ULYSSES</li>
  <li class="number">Is that a wonder?</li>
  <li>The providence that's in a watchful state</li>
  <li>Knows almost every grain of Plutus' gold,</li>
  <li>Finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps,</li>
  <li>Keeps place with thought and almost, like the gods,</li>
  <li class="number">Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.</li>
  <li>There is a mystery — with whom relation</li>
  <li>Durst never meddle — in the soul of state;</li>
  <li>Which hath an operation more divine</li>
  <li>Than breath or pen can give expressure to:</li>
  <li class="number">All the commerce that you have had with Troy</li>
  <li>As perfectly is ours as yours, my lord;</li>
  <li>And better would it fit Achilles much</li>
  <li>To throw down Hector than Polyxena:</li>
  <li>But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home,</li>
  <li class="number">When fame shall in our islands sound her trump,</li>
  <li>And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing,</li>
  <li>'Great Hector's sister did Achilles win,</li>

  <li class="number">O, then, beware;</li>
  <li>Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves:</li>
  <li>Omission to do what is necessary</li>
  <li>Seals a commission to a blank of danger;</li>

  <li class="number">Even then when we sit idly in the sun.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ACHILLES</li>
  <li>Go call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus:</li>
  <li>I'll send the fool to Ajax and desire him</li>
  <li>To invite the Trojan lords after the combat</li>
  <li>To see us here unarm'd: I have a woman's longing,</li>
  <li class="number">An appetite that I am sick withal,</li>

  <li>A labour saved!</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">THERSITES</li>
  <li class="number">A wonder!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ACHILLES</li>
  <li>What?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">THERSITES</li>
  <li>Ajax goes up and down the field, asking for himself.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ACHILLES</li>
  <li>How so?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">THERSITES</li>
  <li>He must fight singly to-morrow with Hector, and is so</li>
  <li class="number">prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he</li>
  <li>raves in saying nothing.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ACHILLES</li>
  <li>How can that be?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">THERSITES</li>
  <li>Why, he stalks up and down like a peacock —  a stride</li>
  <li>and a stand: ruminates like an hostess that hath no</li>
  <li class="number">arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning:</li>
  <li>bites his lip with a politic regard, as who should</li>
  <li>say 'There were wit in this head, an 'twould out;'</li>
  <li>and so there is, but it lies as coldly in him as fire</li>
  <li>in a flint, which will not show without knocking.</li>
  <li class="number">The man's undone forever; for if Hector break not his</li>
  <li>neck i' the combat, he'll break 't himself in</li>
  <li>vain-glory. He knows not me: I said 'Good morrow,</li>
  <li>Ajax;' and he replies 'Thanks, Agamemnon.' What think</li>
  <li>you of this man that takes me for the general? He's</li>
  <li class="number">grown a very land-fish, language-less, a monster.</li>
  <li>A plague of opinion! a man may wear it on both</li>
  <li>sides, like a leather jerkin.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ACHILLES</li>
  <li>Thou must be my ambassador to him, Thersites.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">THERSITES</li>
  <li>Who, I? why, he'll answer nobody; he professes not</li>
  <li class="number">answering: speaking is for beggars; he wears his</li>
  <li>tongue in's arms. I will put on his presence: let</li>
  <li>Patroclus make demands to me, you shall see the</li>
  <li>pageant of Ajax.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ACHILLES</li>
  <li>To him, Patroclus; tell him I humbly desire the</li>
  <li class="number">valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector</li>
  <li>to come unarmed to my tent, and to procure</li>
  <li>safe-conduct for his person of the magnanimous</li>
  <li>and most illustrious six-or-seven-times-honoured</li>
  <li>captain-general of the Grecian army, Agamemnon,</li>

  <li class="number">No, but he's out o' tune thus. What music will be in</li>

  <li>not; but, I am sure, none, unless the fiddler Apollo</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DEIPHOBUS</li>
  <li>It is the Lord AEneas.</li>

  <li>Had I so good occasion to lie long</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DIOMEDES</li>
  <li>That's my mind too. Good morrow, Lord AEneas.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PARIS</li>
  <li>A valiant Greek, AEneas —  take his hand —  </li>
  <li>Witness the process of your speech, wherein</li>
  <li class="number">You told how Diomed, a whole week by days,</li>
  <li>Did haunt you in the field.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AENEAS</li>
  <li>Health to you, valiant sir,</li>
  <li>During all question of the gentle truce;</li>
  <li>But when I meet you arm'd, as black defiance</li>
  <li class="number">As heart can think or courage execute.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DIOMEDES</li>
  <li>The one and other Diomed embraces.</li>
  <li>Our bloods are now in calm; and, so long, health!</li>
  <li>But when contention and occasion meet,</li>
  <li>By Jove, I'll play the hunter for thy life</li>
  <li class="number">With all my force, pursuit and policy.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AENEAS</li>
  <li>And thou shalt hunt a lion, that will fly</li>
  <li>With his face backward. In humane gentleness,</li>
  <li>Welcome to Troy! now, by Anchises' life,</li>
  <li>Welcome, indeed! By Venus' hand I swear,</li>
  <li class="number">No man alive can love in such a sort</li>
  <li>The thing he means to kill more excellently.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DIOMEDES</li>
  <li>We sympathize: Jove, let AEneas live,</li>
  <li>If to my sword his fate be not the glory,</li>
  <li>A thousand complete courses of the sun!</li>
  <li class="number">But, in mine emulous honour, let him die,</li>
  <li>With every joint a wound, and that to-morrow!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AENEAS</li>
  <li>We know each other well.</li>

  <li>We do; and long to know each other worse.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PARIS</li>
  <li>This is the most despiteful gentle greeting,</li>
  <li class="number">The noblest hateful love, that e'er I heard of.</li>
  <li>What business, lord, so early?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AENEAS</li>
  <li>I was sent for to the king; but why, I know not.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PARIS</li>
  <li>His purpose meets you: 'twas to bring this Greek</li>
  <li>To Calchas' house, and there to render him,</li>
  <li class="number">For the enfreed Antenor, the fair Cressid:</li>
  <li>Let's have your company, or, if you please,</li>
  <li>Haste there before us: I constantly do think — </li>
  <li>Or rather, call my thought a certain knowledge — </li>
  <li>My brother Troilus lodges there to-night:</li>
  <li class="number">Rouse him and give him note of our approach.</li>
  <li>With the whole quality wherefore: I fear</li>
  <li>We shall be much unwelcome.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AENEAS</li>
  <li>That I assure you:</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PARIS</li>

  <li>Not palating the taste of her dishonour,</li>
  <li class="number">With such a costly loss of wealth and friends:</li>
  <li>He, like a puling cuckold, would drink up</li>

  <li>You, like a lecher, out of whorish loins</li>

  <li class="speaker">PARIS</li>
  <li>You are too bitter to your countrywoman.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">DIOMEDES</li>
  <li>She's bitter to her country: hear me, Paris:</li>
  <li>For every false drop in her bawdy veins</li>
  <li class="number">A Grecian's life hath sunk; for every scruple</li>
  <li>Of her contaminated carrion weight,</li>
  <li>A Trojan hath been slain: since she could speak,</li>
  <li>She hath not given so many good words breath</li>
  <li>As for her Greeks and Trojans suffer'd death.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PARIS</li>
  <li class="number">Fair Diomed, you do as chapmen do,</li>
  <li>Dispraise the thing that you desire to buy:</li>

  <li class="number">By any voice or order of the field?</li>
  <li>Hector bade ask.</li>

  <li>'Tis done like Hector; but securely done,</li>

  <li>The knight opposed.</li>

  <li>In the extremity of great and little,</li>
  <li>Valour and pride excel themselves in Hector;</li>
  <li>The one almost as infinite as all,</li>
  <li>The other blank as nothing. Weigh him well,</li>
  <li class="number">And that which looks like pride is courtesy.</li>
  <li>This Ajax is half made of Hector's blood:</li>
  <li>In love whereof, half Hector stays at home;</li>
  <li>Half heart, half hand, half Hector comes to seek</li>
  <li>This blended knight, half Trojan and half Greek.</li>

  <li>The youngest son of Priam, a true knight,</li>

  <li>Not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calm'd:</li>
  <li>His heart and hand both open and both free;</li>
  <li>For what he has he gives, what thinks he shows;</li>
  <li class="number">Yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty,</li>
  <li>Nor dignifies an impure thought with breath;</li>
  <li>Manly as Hector, but more dangerous;</li>
  <li>For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes</li>
  <li>To tender objects, but he in heat of action</li>
  <li class="number">Is more vindicative than jealous love:</li>
  <li>They call him Troilus, and on him erect</li>
  <li>A second hope, as fairly built as Hector.</li>
  <li>Thus says AEneas; one that knows the youth</li>
  <li>Even to his inches, and with private soul</li>

  <li>Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member</li>

  <li>I have, thou gallant Trojan, seen thee oft</li>
  <li>Labouring for destiny make cruel way</li>
  <li class="number">Through ranks of Greekish youth, and I have seen thee,</li>
  <li>As hot as Perseus, spur thy Phrygian steed,</li>
  <li>Despising many forfeits and subduements,</li>
  <li>When thou hast hung thy advanced sword i' the air,</li>
  <li>Not letting it decline on the declined,</li>
  <li class="number">That I have said to some my standers by</li>
  <li>'Lo, Jupiter is yonder, dealing life!'</li>

  <li>Like an Olympian wrestling: this have I seen;</li>
  <li class="number">But this thy countenance, still lock'd in steel,</li>
  <li>I never saw till now. I knew thy grandsire,</li>
  <li>And once fought with him: he was a soldier good;</li>
  <li>But, by great Mars, the captain of us all,</li>
  <li>Never saw like thee. Let an old man embrace thee;</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ULYSSES</li>

  <li>I know your favour, Lord Ulysses, well.</li>
  <li>Ah, sir, there's many a Greek and Trojan dead,</li>
  <li class="number">Since first I saw yourself and Diomed</li>
  <li>In Ilion, on your Greekish embassy.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ULYSSES</li>
  <li>Sir, I foretold you then what would ensue:</li>
  <li>My prophecy is but half his journey yet;</li>
  <li>For yonder walls, that pertly front your town,</li>
  <li class="number">Yond towers, whose wanton tops do buss the clouds,</li>
  <li>Must kiss their own feet.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HECTOR</li>
  <li>I must not believe you:</li>
  <li>There they stand yet, and modestly I think,</li>
  <li>The fall of every Phrygian stone will cost</li>
  <li class="number">A drop of Grecian blood: the end crowns all,</li>
  <li>And that old common arbitrator, Time,</li>
  <li>Will one day end it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ULYSSES</li>
  <li>So to him we leave it.</li>
  <li>Most gentle and most valiant Hector, welcome:</li>

  <li>To feast with me and see me at my tent.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ACHILLES</li>
  <li>I shall forestall thee, Lord Ulysses, thou!</li>
  <li>Now, Hector, I have fed mine eyes on thee;</li>
  <li>I have with exact view perused thee, Hector,</li>
  <li class="number">And quoted joint by joint.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HECTOR</li>
  <li>Is this Achilles?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ACHILLES</li>
  <li>I am Achilles.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HECTOR</li>
  <li>Stand fair, I pray thee: let me look on thee.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HECTOR</li>
  <li class="number">Nay, I have done already.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ACHILLES</li>
  <li>Thou art too brief: I will the second time,</li>
  <li>As I would buy thee, view thee limb by limb.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HECTOR</li>
  <li>O, like a book of sport thou'lt read me o'er;</li>
  <li>But there's more in me than thou understand'st.</li>
  <li class="number">Why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ACHILLES</li>
  <li>Tell me, you heavens, in which part of his body</li>
  <li>Shall I destroy him? whether there, or there, or there?</li>
  <li>That I may give the local wound a name</li>
  <li>And make distinct the very breach whereout</li>
  <li class="number">Hector's great spirit flew: answer me, heavens!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HECTOR</li>
  <li>It would discredit the blest gods, proud man,</li>
  <li>To answer such a question: stand again:</li>
  <li>Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly</li>
  <li>As to prenominate in nice conjecture</li>
  <li class="number">Where thou wilt hit me dead?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ACHILLES</li>
  <li>I tell thee, yea.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HECTOR</li>
  <li>Wert thou an oracle to tell me so,</li>
  <li>I'd not believe thee. Henceforth guard thee well;</li>
  <li>For I'll not kill thee there, nor there, nor there;</li>
  <li class="number">But, by the forge that stithied Mars his helm,</li>
  <li>I'll kill thee every where, yea, o'er and o'er.</li>
  <li>You wisest Grecians, pardon me this brag;</li>
  <li>His insolence draws folly from my lips;</li>
  <li>But I'll endeavour deeds to match these words,</li>
  <li class="number">Or may I never — </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">AJAX</li>
  <li>Do not chafe thee, cousin:</li>
  <li>And you, Achilles, let these threats alone,</li>
  <li>Till accident or purpose bring you to't:</li>
  <li>You may have every day enough of Hector</li>
  <li class="number">If you have stomach; the general state, I fear,</li>
  <li>Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HECTOR</li>
  <li>I pray you, let us see you in the field:</li>
  <li>We have had pelting wars, since you refused</li>
  <li>The Grecians' cause.</li>

  <li>To-morrow do I meet thee, fell as death;</li>
  <li>To-night all friends.</li>

  <li class="speaker">HECTOR</li>
  <li>Thy hand upon that match.</li>

  <li>First, all you peers of Greece, go to my tent;</li>
  <li class="number">There in the full convive we: afterwards,</li>
