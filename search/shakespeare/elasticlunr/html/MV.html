<section class="scene">

<h3>SCENE I.  Venice. A street.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter ANTONIO, SALARINO, and SALANIO</div>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:</li>
  <li>It wearies me; you say it wearies you;</li>
  <li>But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,</li>
  <li>What stuff ’tis made of, whereof it is born,</li>
  <li class="number">I am to learn;</li>
  <li>And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,</li>
  <li>That I have much ado to know myself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALARINO">
  <li>Your mind is tossing on the ocean;</li>
  <li>There, where your argosies with portly sail,</li>
  <li class="number">Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,</li>
  <li>Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,</li>
  <li>Do overpeer the petty traffickers,</li>
  <li>That curtsy to them, do them reverence,</li>
  <li>As they fly by them with their woven wings.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALANIO">
  <li class="number">Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,</li>
  <li>The better part of my affections would</li>
  <li>Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still</li>
  <li>Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,</li>
  <li>Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;</li>
  <li class="number">And every object that might make me fear</li>
  <li>Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt</li>
  <li>Would make me sad.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALARINO">
  <li>My wind cooling my broth</li>
  <li>Would blow me to an ague, when I thought</li>
  <li class="number">What harm a wind too great at sea might do.</li>
  <li>I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,</li>
  <li>But I should think of shallows and of flats,</li>
  <li>And see my wealthy Andrew dock’d in sand,</li>
  <li>Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs</li>
  <li class="number">To kiss her burial. Should I go to church</li>
  <li>And see the holy edifice of stone,</li>
  <li>And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,</li>
  <li>Which touching but my gentle vessel’s side,</li>
  <li>Would scatter all her spices on the stream,</li>
  <li class="number">Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,</li>
  <li>And, in a word, but even now worth this,</li>
  <li>And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought</li>
  <li>To think on this, and shall I lack the thought</li>
  <li>That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?</li>
  <li class="number">But tell not me; I know, Antonio</li>
  <li>Is sad to think upon his merchandise.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,</li>
  <li>My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,</li>
  <li>Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate</li>
  <li class="number">Upon the fortune of this present year:</li>
  <li>Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALARINO">
  <li>Why, then you are in love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>Fie, fie!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALARINO">
  <li>Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad,</li>
  <li class="number">Because you are not merry: and ’twere as easy</li>
  <li>For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,</li>
  <li>Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,</li>
  <li>Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:</li>
  <li>Some that will evermore peep through their eyes</li>
  <li class="number">And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,</li>
  <li>And other of such vinegar aspect</li>
  <li>That they’ll not show their teeth in way of smile,</li>
  <li>Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter BASSANIO, LORENZO, and GRATIANO</div>

<ol data-speaker="SALANIO">
  <li>Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,</li>
  <li class="number">Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye well:</li>
  <li>We leave you now with better company.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALARINO">
  <li>I would have stay’d till I had made you merry,</li>
  <li>If worthier friends had not prevented me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>Your worth is very dear in my regard.</li>
  <li class="number">I take it, your own business calls on you</li>
  <li>And you embrace the occasion to depart.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALARINO">
  <li>Good morrow, my good lords.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? say, when?</li>
  <li>You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALARINO">
  <li class="number">We’ll make our leisures to attend on yours.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt Salarino and Salanio</div>

<ol data-speaker="LORENZO">
  <li>My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,</li>
  <li>We two will leave you: but at dinner-time,</li>
  <li>I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>I will not fail you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRATIANO">
  <li class="number">You look not well, Signior Antonio;</li>
  <li>You have too much respect upon the world:</li>
  <li>They lose it that do buy it with much care:</li>
  <li>Believe me, you are marvellously changed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;</li>
  <li class="number">A stage where every man must play a part,</li>
  <li>And mine a sad one.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRATIANO">
  <li>Let me play the fool:</li>
  <li>With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,</li>
  <li>And let my liver rather heat with wine</li>
  <li class="number">Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.</li>
  <li>Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,</li>
  <li>Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?</li>
  <li>Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice</li>
  <li>By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio — </li>
  <li class="number">I love thee, and it is my love that speaks — </li>
  <li>There are a sort of men whose visages</li>
  <li>Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,</li>
  <li>And do a wilful stillness entertain,</li>
  <li>With purpose to be dress’d in an opinion</li>
  <li class="number">Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,</li>
  <li>As who should say ’I am Sir Oracle,</li>
  <li>And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!’</li>
  <li>O my Antonio, I do know of these</li>
  <li>That therefore only are reputed wise</li>
  <li class="number">For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,</li>
  <li>If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,</li>
  <li>Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.</li>
  <li>I’ll tell thee more of this another time:</li>
  <li>But fish not, with this melancholy bait,</li>
  <li class="number">For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.</li>
  <li>Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile:</li>
  <li>I’ll end my exhortation after dinner.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORENZO">
  <li>Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time:</li>
  <li>I must be one of these same dumb wise men,</li>
  <li class="number">For Gratiano never lets me speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRATIANO">
  <li>Well, keep me company but two years moe,</li>
  <li>Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>Farewell: I’ll grow a talker for this gear.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRATIANO">
  <li>Thanks, i’ faith, for silence is only commendable</li>
  <li class="number">In a neat’s tongue dried and a maid not vendible.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt GRATIANO and LORENZO</div>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>Is that any thing now?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more</li>
  <li>than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two</li>
  <li>grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you</li>
  <li class="number">shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you</li>
  <li>have them, they are not worth the search.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>Well, tell me now what lady is the same</li>
  <li>To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,</li>
  <li>That you to-day promised to tell me of?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li class="number">’Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,</li>
  <li>How much I have disabled mine estate,</li>
  <li>By something showing a more swelling port</li>
  <li>Than my faint means would grant continuance:</li>
  <li>Nor do I now make moan to be abridged</li>
  <li class="number">From such a noble rate; but my chief care</li>
  <li>Is to come fairly off from the great debts</li>
  <li>Wherein my time something too prodigal</li>
  <li>Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,</li>
  <li>I owe the most, in money and in love,</li>
  <li class="number">And from your love I have a warranty</li>
  <li>To unburden all my plots and purposes</li>
  <li>How to get clear of all the debts I owe.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;</li>
  <li>And if it stand, as you yourself still do,</li>
  <li class="number">Within the eye of honour, be assured,</li>
  <li>My purse, my person, my extremest means,</li>
  <li>Lie all unlock’d to your occasions.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,</li>
  <li>I shot his fellow of the self-same flight</li>
  <li class="number">The self-same way with more advised watch,</li>
  <li>To find the other forth, and by adventuring both</li>
  <li>I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,</li>
  <li>Because what follows is pure innocence.</li>
  <li>I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,</li>
  <li class="number">That which I owe is lost; but if you please</li>
  <li>To shoot another arrow that self way</li>
  <li>Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,</li>
  <li>As I will watch the aim, or to find both</li>
  <li>Or bring your latter hazard back again</li>
  <li class="number">And thankfully rest debtor for the first.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>You know me well, and herein spend but time</li>
  <li>To wind about my love with circumstance;</li>
  <li>And out of doubt you do me now more wrong</li>
  <li>In making question of my uttermost</li>
  <li class="number">Than if you had made waste of all I have:</li>
  <li>Then do but say to me what I should do</li>
  <li>That in your knowledge may by me be done,</li>
  <li>And I am prest unto it: therefore, speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>In Belmont is a lady richly left;</li>
  <li class="number">And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,</li>
  <li>Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes</li>
  <li>I did receive fair speechless messages:</li>
  <li>Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued</li>
  <li>To Cato’s daughter, Brutus’ Portia:</li>
  <li class="number">Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,</li>
  <li>For the four winds blow in from every coast</li>
  <li>Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks</li>
  <li>Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;</li>
  <li>Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos’ strand,</li>
  <li class="number">And many Jasons come in quest of her.</li>
  <li>O my Antonio, had I but the means</li>
  <li>To hold a rival place with one of them,</li>
  <li>I have a mind presages me such thrift,</li>
  <li>That I should questionless be fortunate!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li class="number">Thou know’st that all my fortunes are at sea;</li>
  <li>Neither have I money nor commodity</li>
  <li>To raise a present sum: therefore go forth;</li>
  <li>Try what my credit can in Venice do:</li>
  <li>That shall be rack’d, even to the uttermost,</li>
  <li class="number">To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia.</li>
  <li>Go, presently inquire, and so will I,</li>
  <li>Where money is, and I no question make</li>
  <li>To have it of my trust or for my sake.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt</div>

<h3>SCENE II: Belmont. A room in PORTIA’S house.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter PORTIA and NERISSA</div>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of</li>
  <li>this great world.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NERISSA">
  <li>You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in</li>
  <li>the same abundance as your good fortunes are: and</li>
  <li class="number">yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit</li>
  <li>with too much as they that starve with nothing. It</li>
  <li>is no mean happiness therefore, to be seated in the</li>
  <li>mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but</li>
  <li>competency lives longer.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li class="number">Good sentences and well pronounced.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NERISSA">
  <li>They would be better, if well followed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>If to do were as easy as to know what were good to</li>
  <li>do, chapels had been churches and poor men’s</li>
  <li>cottages princes’ palaces. It is a good divine that</li>
  <li class="number">follows his own instructions: I can easier teach</li>
  <li>twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the</li>
  <li>twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may</li>
  <li>devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps</li>
  <li>o’er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the</li>
  <li class="number">youth, to skip o’er the meshes of good counsel the</li>
  <li>cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to</li>
  <li>choose me a husband. O me, the word ’choose!’ I may</li>
  <li>neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I</li>
  <li>dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curbed</li>
  <li class="number">by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard,</li>
  <li>Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NERISSA">
  <li>Your father was ever virtuous; and holy men at their</li>
  <li>death have good inspirations: therefore the lottery,</li>
  <li>that he hath devised in these three chests of gold,</li>
  <li class="number">silver and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning</li>
  <li>chooses you, will, no doubt, never be chosen by any</li>
  <li>rightly but one who shall rightly love. But what</li>
  <li>warmth is there in your affection towards any of</li>
  <li>these princely suitors that are already come?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li class="number">I pray thee, over-name them; and as thou namest</li>
  <li>them, I will describe them; and, according to my</li>
  <li>description, level at my affection.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NERISSA">
  <li>First, there is the Neapolitan prince.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>Ay, that’s a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but</li>
  <li class="number">talk of his horse; and he makes it a great</li>
  <li>appropriation to his own good parts, that he can</li>
  <li>shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his</li>
  <li>mother played false with a smith.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NERISSA">
  <li>Then there is the County Palatine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li class="number">He doth nothing but frown, as who should say ’If you</li>
  <li>will not have me, choose:’ he hears merry tales and</li>
  <li>smiles not: I fear he will prove the weeping</li>
  <li>philosopher when he grows old, being so full of</li>
  <li>unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be</li>
  <li class="number">married to a death’s-head with a bone in his mouth</li>
  <li>than to either of these. God defend me from these</li>
  <li>two!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NERISSA">
  <li>How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man.</li>
  <li class="number">In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker: but,</li>
  <li>he! why, he hath a horse better than the</li>
  <li>Neapolitan’s, a better bad habit of frowning than</li>
  <li>the Count Palatine; he is every man in no man; if a</li>
  <li>throstle sing, he falls straight a capering: he will</li>
  <li class="number">fence with his own shadow: if I should marry him, I</li>
  <li>should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me</li>
  <li>I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I</li>
  <li>shall never requite him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NERISSA">
  <li>What say you, then, to Falconbridge, the young baron</li>
  <li class="number">of England?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>You know I say nothing to him, for he understands</li>
  <li>not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French,</li>
  <li>nor Italian, and you will come into the court and</li>
  <li>swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English.</li>
  <li class="number">He is a proper man’s picture, but, alas, who can</li>
  <li>converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited!</li>
  <li>I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round</li>
  <li>hose in France, his bonnet in Germany and his</li>
  <li>behavior every where.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NERISSA">
  <li class="number">What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he</li>
  <li>borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and</li>
  <li>swore he would pay him again when he was able: I</li>
  <li>think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed</li>
  <li class="number">under for another.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NERISSA">
  <li>How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony’s nephew?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober, and</li>
  <li>most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk: when</li>
  <li>he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and</li>
  <li class="number">when he is worst, he is little better than a beast:</li>
  <li>and the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall</li>
  <li>make shift to go without him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NERISSA">
  <li>If he should offer to choose, and choose the right</li>
  <li>casket, you should refuse to perform your father’s</li>
  <li class="number">will, if you should refuse to accept him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee, set a</li>
  <li>deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket,</li>
  <li>for if the devil be within and that temptation</li>
  <li>without, I know he will choose it. I will do any</li>
  <li class="number">thing, Nerissa, ere I’ll be married to a sponge.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NERISSA">
  <li>You need not fear, lady, the having any of these</li>
  <li>lords: they have acquainted me with their</li>
  <li>determinations; which is, indeed, to return to their</li>
  <li>home and to trouble you with no more suit, unless</li>
  <li class="number">you may be won by some other sort than your father’s</li>
  <li>imposition depending on the caskets.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as</li>
  <li>chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner</li>
  <li>of my father’s will. I am glad this parcel of wooers</li>
  <li class="number">are so reasonable, for there is not one among them</li>
  <li>but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God grant</li>
  <li>them a fair departure.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NERISSA">
  <li>Do you not remember, lady, in your father’s time, a</li>
  <li>Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither</li>
  <li class="number">in company of the Marquis of Montferrat?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, he was so called.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NERISSA">
  <li>True, madam: he, of all the men that ever my foolish</li>
  <li>eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of</li>
  <li class="number">thy praise.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter a Serving-man</li>
  <li>How now! what news?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Servant">
  <li>The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take</li>
  <li>their leave: and there is a forerunner come from a</li>
  <li>fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the</li>
  <li class="number">prince his master will be here to-night.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a</li>
  <li>heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should</li>
  <li>be glad of his approach: if he have the condition</li>
  <li>of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had</li>
  <li class="number">rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come,</li>
  <li>Nerissa. Sirrah, go before.</li>
  <li>Whiles we shut the gates</li>
  <li>upon one wooer, another knocks at the door.</li>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li>For three months; well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li class="number">Antonio shall become bound; well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>May you stead me? will you pleasure me? shall I</li>
  <li>know your answer?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li>Three thousand ducats for three months and Antonio bound.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>Your answer to that.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li class="number">Antonio is a good man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li>Oh, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a</li>
  <li>good man is to have you understand me that he is</li>
  <li>sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he</li>
  <li class="number">hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the</li>
  <li>Indies; I understand moreover, upon the Rialto, he</li>
  <li>hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and</li>
  <li>other ventures he hath, squandered abroad. But ships</li>
  <li>are but boards, sailors but men: there be land-rats</li>
  <li class="number">and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves, I</li>
  <li>mean pirates, and then there is the peril of waters,</li>
  <li>winds and rocks. The man is, notwithstanding,</li>
  <li>sufficient. Three thousand ducats; I think I may</li>
  <li>take his bond.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li class="number">Be assured you may.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li>I will be assured I may; and, that I may be assured,</li>
  <li>I will bethink me. May I speak with Antonio?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>If it please you to dine with us.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li>Yes, to smell pork; to eat of the habitation which</li>
  <li class="number">your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into. I</li>
  <li>will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you,</li>
  <li>walk with you, and so following, but I will not eat</li>
  <li>with you, drink with you, nor pray with you. What</li>
  <li>news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter ANTONIO</div>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li class="number">This is Signior Antonio.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li><span class="stage-direction">Aside</span>  How like a fawning publican he looks!</li>
  <li>I hate him for he is a Christian,</li>
  <li>But more for that in low simplicity</li>
  <li>He lends out money gratis and brings down</li>
  <li class="number">The rate of usance here with us in Venice.</li>
  <li>If I can catch him once upon the hip,</li>
  <li>I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.</li>
  <li>He hates our sacred nation, and he rails,</li>
  <li>Even there where merchants most do congregate,</li>
  <li class="number">On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,</li>
  <li>Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe,</li>
  <li>If I forgive him!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>Shylock, do you hear?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li>I am debating of my present store,</li>
  <li class="number">And, by the near guess of my memory,</li>
  <li>I cannot instantly raise up the gross</li>
  <li>Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?</li>
  <li>Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,</li>
  <li>Will furnish me. But soft! how many months</li>
  <li class="number">Do you desire?</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">To ANTONIO</li>
  <li>Rest you fair, good signior;</li>
  <li>Your worship was the last man in our mouths.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>Shylock, although I neither lend nor borrow</li>
  <li>By taking nor by giving of excess,</li>
  <li class="number">Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,</li>
  <li>I’ll break a custom. Is he yet possess’d</li>
  <li>How much ye would?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li>Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>And for three months.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li class="number">I had forgot; three months; you told me so.</li>
  <li>Well then, your bond; and let me see; but hear you;</li>
  <li>Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow</li>
  <li>Upon advantage.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>I do never use it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li class="number">When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban’s sheep — </li>
  <li>This Jacob from our holy Abram was,</li>
  <li>As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,</li>
  <li>The third possessor; ay, he was the third — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>And what of him? did he take interest?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li class="number">No, not take interest, not, as you would say,</li>
  <li>Directly interest: mark what Jacob did.</li>
  <li>When Laban and himself were compromised</li>
  <li>That all the eanlings which were streak’d and pied</li>
  <li>Should fall as Jacob’s hire, the ewes, being rank,</li>
  <li class="number">In the end of autumn turned to the rams,</li>
  <li>And, when the work of generation was</li>
  <li>Between these woolly breeders in the act,</li>
  <li>The skilful shepherd peel’d me certain wands,</li>
  <li>And, in the doing of the deed of kind,</li>
  <li class="number">He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,</li>
  <li>Who then conceiving did in eaning time</li>
  <li>Fall parti-colour’d lambs, and those were Jacob’s.</li>
  <li>This was a way to thrive, and he was blest:</li>
  <li>And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li class="number">This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served for;</li>
  <li>A thing not in his power to bring to pass,</li>
  <li>But sway’d and fashion’d by the hand of heaven.</li>
  <li>Was this inserted to make interest good?</li>
  <li>Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li class="number">I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast:</li>
  <li>But note me, signior.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>Mark you this, Bassanio,</li>
  <li>The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.</li>
  <li>An evil soul producing holy witness</li>
  <li class="number">Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,</li>
  <li>A goodly apple rotten at the heart:</li>
  <li>O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li>Three thousand ducats; ’tis a good round sum.</li>
  <li>Three months from twelve; then, let me see; the rate — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li class="number">Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li>Signior Antonio, many a time and oft</li>
  <li>In the Rialto you have rated me</li>
  <li>About my moneys and my usances:</li>
  <li>Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,</li>
  <li class="number">For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.</li>
  <li>You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,</li>
  <li>And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,</li>
  <li>And all for use of that which is mine own.</li>
  <li>Well then, it now appears you need my help:</li>
  <li class="number">Go to, then; you come to me, and you say</li>
  <li>’Shylock, we would have moneys:’ you say so;</li>
  <li>You, that did void your rheum upon my beard</li>
  <li>And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur</li>
  <li>Over your threshold: moneys is your suit</li>
  <li class="number">What should I say to you? Should I not say</li>
  <li>’Hath a dog money? is it possible</li>
  <li>A cur can lend three thousand ducats?’ Or</li>
  <li>Shall I bend low and in a bondman’s key,</li>
  <li>With bated breath and whispering humbleness, Say this;</li>
  <li class="number">’Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last;</li>
  <li>You spurn’d me such a day; another time</li>
  <li>You call’d me dog; and for these courtesies</li>
  <li>I’ll lend you thus much moneys’?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>I am as like to call thee so again,</li>
  <li class="number">To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too.</li>
  <li>If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not</li>
  <li>As to thy friends; for when did friendship take</li>
  <li>A breed for barren metal of his friend?</li>
  <li>But lend it rather to thine enemy,</li>
  <li class="number">Who, if he break, thou mayst with better face</li>
  <li>Exact the penalty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li>Why, look you, how you storm!</li>
  <li>I would be friends with you and have your love,</li>
  <li>Forget the shames that you have stain’d me with,</li>
  <li class="number">Supply your present wants and take no doit</li>
  <li>Of usance for my moneys, and you’ll not hear me:</li>
  <li>This is kind I offer.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>This were kindness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li>This kindness will I show.</li>
  <li class="number">Go with me to a notary, seal me there</li>
  <li>Your single bond; and, in a merry sport,</li>
  <li>If you repay me not on such a day,</li>
  <li>In such a place, such sum or sums as are</li>
  <li>Express’d in the condition, let the forfeit</li>
  <li class="number">Be nominated for an equal pound</li>
  <li>Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken</li>
  <li>In what part of your body pleaseth me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>Content, i’ faith: I’ll seal to such a bond</li>
  <li>And say there is much kindness in the Jew.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li class="number">You shall not seal to such a bond for me:</li>
  <li>I’ll rather dwell in my necessity.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it:</li>
  <li>Within these two months, that’s a month before</li>
  <li>This bond expires, I do expect return</li>
  <li class="number">Of thrice three times the value of this bond.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li>O father Abram, what these Christians are,</li>
  <li>Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect</li>
  <li>The thoughts of others! Pray you, tell me this;</li>
  <li>If he should break his day, what should I gain</li>
  <li class="number">By the exaction of the forfeiture?</li>
  <li>A pound of man’s flesh taken from a man</li>
  <li>Is not so estimable, profitable neither,</li>
  <li>As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say,</li>
  <li>To buy his favour, I extend this friendship:</li>
  <li class="number">If he will take it, so; if not, adieu;</li>
  <li>And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>Yes Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li>Then meet me forthwith at the notary’s;</li>
  <li>Give him direction for this merry bond,</li>
  <li class="number">And I will go and purse the ducats straight,</li>
  <li>See to my house, left in the fearful guard</li>
  <li>Of an unthrifty knave, and presently</li>
  <li>I will be with you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>Hie thee, gentle Jew.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exit Shylock</li>
  <li class="number">The Hebrew will turn Christian: he grows kind.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>I like not fair terms and a villain’s mind.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>Come on: in this there can be no dismay;</li>
  <li>My ships come home a month before the day.</li>

  <li class="number">The best-regarded virgins of our clime</li>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>In terms of choice I am not solely led</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  Venice. A street.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter LAUNCELOT</div>

<ol data-speaker="LAUNCELOT">
  <li>Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from</li>
  <li>this Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow and</li>
  <li>tempts me saying to me ’Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good</li>
  <li>Launcelot,’ or ’good Gobbo,’ or good Launcelot</li>
  <li class="number">Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away. My</li>
  <li>conscience says ’No; take heed,’ honest Launcelot;</li>
  <li>take heed, honest Gobbo, or, as aforesaid, ’honest</li>
  <li>Launcelot Gobbo; do not run; scorn running with thy</li>
  <li>heels.’ Well, the most courageous fiend bids me</li>
  <li class="number">pack: ’Via!’ says the fiend; ’away!’ says the</li>
  <li>fiend; ’for the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,’</li>
  <li>says the fiend, ’and run.’ Well, my conscience,</li>
  <li>hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely</li>
  <li>to me ’My honest friend Launcelot, being an honest</li>
  <li class="number">man’s son,’ or rather an honest woman’s son; for,</li>
  <li>indeed, my father did something smack, something</li>
  <li>grow to, he had a kind of taste; well, my conscience</li>
  <li>says ’Launcelot, budge not.’ ’Budge,’ says the</li>
  <li>fiend. ’Budge not,’ says my conscience.</li>
  <li class="number">’Conscience,’ say I, ’you counsel well;’ ’ Fiend,’</li>
  <li>say I, ’you counsel well:’ to be ruled by my</li>

  <li>who, God bless the mark, is a kind of devil; and, to</li>
  <li>run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the</li>
  <li class="number">fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the devil</li>
  <li>himself. Certainly the Jew is the very devil</li>
  <li>incarnal; and, in my conscience, my conscience is</li>
  <li>but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel</li>
  <li>me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more</li>
  <li class="number">friendly counsel: I will run, fiend; my heels are</li>
  <li>at your command; I will run.</li>

  <li>Alack, sir, I am sand-blind; I know you not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAUNCELOT">
  <li>Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of</li>
  <li>the knowing me: it is a wise father that knows his</li>
  <li class="number">own child. Well, old man, I will tell you news of</li>
  <li>your son: give me your blessing: truth will come</li>
  <li>to light; murder cannot be hid long; a man’s son</li>
  <li>may, but at the length truth will out.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GOBBO">

<ol data-speaker="LAUNCELOT">
  <li>Pray you, let’s have no more fooling about it, but</li>

<ol data-speaker="GOBBO">
  <li>Her name is Margery, indeed: I’ll be sworn, if thou</li>

  <li>Lord worshipped might he be! what a beard hast thou</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAUNCELOT">
  <li>It should seem, then, that Dobbin’s tail grows</li>

<ol data-speaker="LAUNCELOT">
  <li class="number">Well, well: but, for mine own part, as I have set</li>
  <li>up my rest to run away, so I will not rest till I</li>

  <li>him a present! give him a halter: I am famished in</li>
  <li>his service; you may tell every finger I have with</li>

  <li>I’ll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.</li>
  <li>What says the silver with her virgin hue?</li>
  <li>’Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.’</li>
  <li>As much as he deserves! Pause there, Morocco,</li>
  <li class="number">And weigh thy value with an even hand:</li>
  <li>If thou be’st rated by thy estimation,</li>
  <li>Thou dost deserve enough; and yet enough</li>
  <li>May not extend so far as to the lady:</li>
  <li>And yet to be afeard of my deserving</li>
  <li class="number">Were but a weak disabling of myself.</li>
  <li>As much as I deserve! Why, that’s the lady:</li>
  <li>I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,</li>
  <li>In graces and in qualities of breeding;</li>
  <li>But more than these, in love I do deserve.</li>
  <li class="number">What if I stray’d no further, but chose here?</li>
  <li>Let’s see once more this saying graved in gold</li>
  <li>’Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.’</li>
  <li>Why, that’s the lady; all the world desires her;</li>
  <li>From the four corners of the earth they come,</li>
  <li class="number">To kiss this shrine, this mortal-breathing saint:</li>
  <li>The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds</li>
  <li>Of wide Arabia are as thoroughfares now</li>
  <li>For princes to come view fair Portia:</li>
  <li>The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head</li>
  <li class="number">Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar</li>
  <li>To stop the foreign spirits, but they come,</li>
  <li>As o’er a brook, to see fair Portia.</li>
  <li>One of these three contains her heavenly picture.</li>
  <li>Is’t like that lead contains her? ’Twere damnation</li>
  <li class="number">To think so base a thought: it were too gross</li>
  <li>To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.</li>
  <li>Or shall I think in silver she’s immured,</li>
  <li>Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?</li>
  <li>O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem</li>
  <li class="number">Was set in worse than gold. They have in England</li>
  <li>A coin that bears the figure of an angel</li>
  <li>Stamped in gold, but that’s insculp’d upon;</li>
  <li>But here an angel in a golden bed</li>
  <li>Lies all within. Deliver me the key:</li>

  <li>The villain Jew with outcries raised the duke,</li>

<ol data-speaker="SALARINO">
  <li>He came too late, the ship was under sail:</li>
  <li>But there the duke was given to understand</li>
  <li>That in a gondola were seen together</li>
  <li>Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica:</li>

  <li>They were not with Bassanio in his ship.</li>

<ol data-speaker="SALANIO">
  <li>Now, what news on the Rialto?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALARINO">
  <li>Why, yet it lives there uncheck’d that Antonio hath</li>
  <li>a ship of rich lading wrecked on the narrow seas;</li>
  <li>the Goodwins, I think they call the place; a very</li>
  <li class="number">dangerous flat and fatal, where the carcasses of many</li>
  <li>a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossip</li>
  <li>Report be an honest woman of her word.</li>

<ol data-speaker="SALANIO">
  <li>I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever</li>
  <li>knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she</li>
  <li class="number">wept for the death of a third husband. But it is</li>
  <li>true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing the</li>
  <li>plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio, the</li>
  <li>honest Antonio — O that I had a title good enough</li>
  <li>to keep his name company! — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALARINO">
  <li class="number">Come, the full stop.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALANIO">
  <li>Ha! what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath</li>
  <li>lost a ship.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALARINO">
  <li>I would it might prove the end of his losses.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALANIO">
  <li>Let me say ’amen’ betimes, lest the devil cross my</li>

  <li class="stage-direction">Enter SHYLOCK</li>
  <li>How now, Shylock! what news among the merchants?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li>You know, none so well, none so well as you, of my</li>
  <li>daughter’s flight.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALARINO">
  <li>That’s certain: I, for my part, knew the tailor</li>
  <li class="number">that made the wings she flew withal.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALANIO">
  <li>And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was</li>
  <li>fledged; and then it is the complexion of them all</li>
  <li>to leave the dam.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li>She is damned for it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALANIO">

  <li>Out upon it, old carrion! rebels it at these years?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li>I say, my daughter is my flesh and blood.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALARINO">
  <li>There is more difference between thy flesh and hers</li>
  <li class="number">than between jet and ivory; more between your bloods</li>
  <li>than there is between red wine and rhenish. But</li>
  <li>tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any</li>
  <li>loss at sea or no?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li>There I have another bad match: a bankrupt, a</li>
  <li class="number">prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the</li>
  <li>Rialto; a beggar, that was used to come so smug upon</li>
  <li>the mart; let him look to his bond: he was wont to</li>
  <li>call me usurer; let him look to his bond: he was</li>
  <li>wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy; let him</li>
  <li class="number">look to his bond.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALARINO">
  <li>Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not take</li>
  <li>his flesh: what’s that good for?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li>To bait fish withal: if it will feed nothing else,</li>
  <li>it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me, and</li>
  <li class="number">hindered me half a million; laughed at my losses,</li>
  <li>mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my</li>
  <li>bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine</li>
  <li>enemies; and what’s his reason? I am a Jew. Hath</li>
  <li>not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs,</li>
  <li class="number">dimensions, senses, affections, passions? fed with</li>
  <li>the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject</li>
  <li>to the same diseases, healed by the same means,</li>
  <li>warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as</li>
  <li>a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed?</li>
  <li class="number">if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison</li>
  <li>us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not</li>
  <li>revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will</li>
  <li>resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian,</li>
  <li>what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian</li>
  <li class="number">wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by</li>
  <li>Christian example? Why, revenge. The villany you</li>
  <li>teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I</li>

  <li>cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfort! The curse</li>
  <li>never fell upon our nation till now; I never felt it</li>
  <li class="number">till now: two thousand ducats in that; and other</li>
  <li>precious, precious jewels. I would my daughter</li>
  <li>were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear!</li>
  <li>would she were hearsed at my foot, and the ducats in</li>

  <li class="number">not what’s spent in the search: why, thou loss upon</li>
  <li>loss! the thief gone with so much, and so much to</li>
  <li>find the thief; and no satisfaction, no revenge:</li>
  <li>nor no in luck stirring but what lights on my</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TUBAL">
  <li>Yes, other men have ill luck too: Antonio, as I</li>
  <li>heard in Genoa — </li>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li>What, what, what? ill luck, ill luck?</li>

<ol data-speaker="TUBAL">
  <li>I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck.</li>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li>I thank thee, good Tubal: good news, good news!</li>
  <li>ha, ha! where? in Genoa?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TUBAL">
  <li>Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, in one</li>
  <li class="number">night fourscore ducats.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li>Thou stickest a dagger in me: I shall never see my</li>
  <li>gold again: fourscore ducats at a sitting!</li>
  <li>fourscore ducats!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TUBAL">
  <li>There came divers of Antonio’s creditors in my</li>
  <li class="number">company to Venice, that swear he cannot choose but break.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li>I am very glad of it: I’ll plague him; I’ll torture</li>
  <li>him: I am glad of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TUBAL">
  <li>One of them showed me a ring that he had of your</li>
  <li>daughter for a monkey.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li class="number">Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal: it was my</li>
  <li>turquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor:</li>
  <li>I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TUBAL">
  <li>But Antonio is certainly undone.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li>Nay, that’s true, that’s very true. Go, Tubal, fee</li>
  <li class="number">me an officer; bespeak him a fortnight before. I</li>
  <li>will have the heart of him, if he forfeit; for, were</li>
  <li>he out of Venice, I can make what merchandise I</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter BASSANIO, PORTIA, GRATIANO, NERISSA, and
Attendants</div>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>I pray you, tarry: pause a day or two</li>
  <li>Before you hazard; for, in choosing wrong,</li>
  <li>I lose your company: therefore forbear awhile.</li>
  <li>There’s something tells me, but it is not love,</li>
  <li class="number">I would not lose you; and you know yourself,</li>
  <li>Hate counsels not in such a quality.</li>
  <li>But lest you should not understand me well — </li>
  <li>And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought — </li>
  <li>I would detain you here some month or two</li>
  <li class="number">Before you venture for me. I could teach you</li>
  <li>How to choose right, but I am then forsworn;</li>
  <li>So will I never be: so may you miss me;</li>
  <li>But if you do, you’ll make me wish a sin,</li>
  <li>That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,</li>
  <li class="number">They have o’erlook’d me and divided me;</li>
  <li>One half of me is yours, the other half yours,</li>
  <li>Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,</li>
  <li>And so all yours. O, these naughty times</li>
  <li>Put bars between the owners and their rights!</li>
  <li class="number">And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so,</li>
  <li>Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.</li>
  <li>I speak too long; but ’tis to peize the time,</li>
  <li>To eke it and to draw it out in length,</li>
  <li>To stay you from election.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li class="number">Let me choose</li>
  <li>For as I am, I live upon the rack.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>Upon the rack, Bassanio! then confess</li>
  <li>What treason there is mingled with your love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>None but that ugly treason of mistrust,</li>
  <li class="number">Which makes me fear the enjoying of my love:</li>
  <li>There may as well be amity and life</li>
  <li>’Tween snow and fire, as treason and my love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack,</li>
  <li>Where men enforced do speak anything.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li class="number">Promise me life, and I’ll confess the truth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>Well then, confess and live.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>’Confess’ and ’love’</li>
  <li>Had been the very sum of my confession:</li>
  <li>O happy torment, when my torturer</li>
  <li class="number">Doth teach me answers for deliverance!</li>
  <li>But let me to my fortune and the caskets.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>Away, then! I am lock’d in one of them:</li>
  <li>If you do love me, you will find me out.</li>
  <li>Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.</li>
  <li class="number">Let music sound while he doth make his choice;</li>
  <li>Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,</li>
  <li>Fading in music: that the comparison</li>
  <li>May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream</li>
  <li>And watery death-bed for him. He may win;</li>
  <li class="number">And what is music then? Then music is</li>
  <li>Even as the flourish when true subjects bow</li>
  <li>To a new-crowned monarch: such it is</li>
  <li>As are those dulcet sounds in break of day</li>
  <li>That creep into the dreaming bridegroom’s ear,</li>
  <li class="number">And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,</li>
  <li>With no less presence, but with much more love,</li>
  <li>Than young Alcides, when he did redeem</li>
  <li>The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy</li>
  <li>To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice</li>
  <li class="number">The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,</li>
  <li>With bleared visages, come forth to view</li>
  <li>The issue of the exploit. Go, Hercules!</li>
  <li>Live thou, I live: with much, much more dismay</li>
  <li>I view the fight than thou that makest the fray.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Music, whilst BASSANIO comments on the caskets to himself</li>
  <li class="subhead">SONG.</li>
  <li class="number">Tell me where is fancy bred,</li>
  <li>Or in the heart, or in the head?</li>
  <li>How begot, how nourished?</li>
  <li>Reply, reply.</li>
  <li>It is engender’d in the eyes,</li>
  <li class="number">With gazing fed; and fancy dies</li>
  <li>In the cradle where it lies.</li>
  <li>Let us all ring fancy’s knell</li>
  <li>I’ll begin it — Ding, dong, bell.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALL">
  <li>Ding, dong, bell.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li class="number">So may the outward shows be least themselves:</li>
  <li>The world is still deceived with ornament.</li>
  <li>In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt,</li>
  <li>But, being seasoned with a gracious voice,</li>
  <li>Obscures the show of evil? In religion,</li>
  <li class="number">What damned error, but some sober brow</li>
  <li>Will bless it and approve it with a text,</li>
  <li>Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?</li>
  <li>There is no vice so simple but assumes</li>
  <li>Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:</li>
  <li class="number">How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false</li>
  <li>As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins</li>
  <li>The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars;</li>
  <li>Who, inward search’d, have livers white as milk;</li>
  <li>And these assume but valour’s excrement</li>
  <li class="number">To render them redoubted! Look on beauty,</li>
  <li>And you shall see ’tis purchased by the weight;</li>
  <li>Which therein works a miracle in nature,</li>
  <li>Making them lightest that wear most of it:</li>
  <li>So are those crisped snaky golden locks</li>
  <li class="number">Which make such wanton gambols with the wind,</li>
  <li>Upon supposed fairness, often known</li>
  <li>To be the dowry of a second head,</li>
  <li>The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.</li>
  <li>Thus ornament is but the guiled shore</li>
  <li class="number">To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf</li>
  <li>Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,</li>
  <li>The seeming truth which cunning times put on</li>
  <li>To entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold,</li>
  <li>Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee;</li>
  <li class="number">Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge</li>
  <li>’Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead,</li>
  <li>Which rather threatenest than dost promise aught,</li>
  <li>Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence;</li>
  <li>And here choose I; joy be the consequence!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li class="number"><span class="stage-direction">Aside</span>  How all the other passions fleet to air,</li>
  <li>As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embraced despair,</li>
  <li>And shuddering fear, and green-eyed jealousy! O love,</li>
  <li>Be moderate; allay thy ecstasy,</li>
  <li>In measure rein thy joy; scant this excess.</li>
  <li class="number">I feel too much thy blessing: make it less,</li>
  <li>For fear I surfeit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>What find I here?</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Opening the leaden casket</li>
  <li>Fair Portia’s counterfeit! What demi-god</li>
  <li>Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes?</li>
  <li class="number">Or whether, riding on the balls of mine,</li>
  <li>Seem they in motion? Here are sever’d lips,</li>
  <li>Parted with sugar breath: so sweet a bar</li>
  <li>Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs</li>
  <li>The painter plays the spider and hath woven</li>
  <li class="number">A golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men,</li>
  <li>Faster than gnats in cobwebs; but her eyes — </li>
  <li>How could he see to do them? having made one,</li>
  <li>Methinks it should have power to steal both his</li>
  <li>And leave itself unfurnish’d. Yet look, how far</li>
  <li class="number">The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow</li>
  <li>In underprizing it, so far this shadow</li>
  <li>Doth limp behind the substance. Here’s the scroll,</li>
  <li>The continent and summary of my fortune.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Reads</li>
  <li>You that choose not by the view,</li>
  <li class="number">Chance as fair and choose as true!</li>
  <li>Since this fortune falls to you,</li>
  <li>Be content and seek no new,</li>
  <li>If you be well pleased with this</li>
  <li>And hold your fortune for your bliss,</li>
  <li class="number">Turn you where your lady is</li>
  <li>And claim her with a loving kiss.</li>
  <li>A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave;</li>
  <li>I come by note, to give and to receive.</li>
  <li>Like one of two contending in a prize,</li>
  <li class="number">That thinks he hath done well in people’s eyes,</li>
  <li>Hearing applause and universal shout,</li>
  <li>Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt</li>
  <li>Whether these pearls of praise be his or no;</li>
  <li>So, thrice fair lady, stand I, even so;</li>
  <li class="number">As doubtful whether what I see be true,</li>
  <li>Until confirm’d, sign’d, ratified by you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,</li>
  <li>Such as I am: though for myself alone</li>
  <li>I would not be ambitious in my wish,</li>
  <li class="number">To wish myself much better; yet, for you</li>
  <li>I would be trebled twenty times myself;</li>
  <li>A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich;</li>
  <li>That only to stand high in your account,</li>
  <li>I might in virtue, beauties, livings, friends,</li>
  <li class="number">Exceed account; but the full sum of me</li>
  <li>Is sum of something, which, to term in gross,</li>
  <li>Is an unlesson’d girl, unschool’d, unpractised;</li>
  <li>Happy in this, she is not yet so old</li>
  <li>But she may learn; happier than this,</li>
  <li class="number">She is not bred so dull but she can learn;</li>
  <li>Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit</li>
  <li>Commits itself to yours to be directed,</li>
  <li>As from her lord, her governor, her king.</li>
  <li>Myself and what is mine to you and yours</li>
  <li class="number">Is now converted: but now I was the lord</li>
  <li>Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,</li>
  <li>Queen o’er myself: and even now, but now,</li>
  <li>This house, these servants and this same myself</li>
  <li>Are yours, my lord: I give them with this ring;</li>
  <li class="number">Which when you part from, lose, or give away,</li>
  <li>Let it presage the ruin of your love</li>
  <li>And be my vantage to exclaim on you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>Madam, you have bereft me of all words,</li>
  <li>Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;</li>
  <li class="number">And there is such confusion in my powers,</li>
  <li>As after some oration fairly spoke</li>
  <li>By a beloved prince, there doth appear</li>
  <li>Among the buzzing pleased multitude;</li>
  <li>Where every something, being blent together,</li>
  <li class="number">Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy,</li>
  <li>Express’d and not express’d. But when this ring</li>
  <li>Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence:</li>
  <li>O, then be bold to say Bassanio’s dead!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NERISSA">
  <li>My lord and lady, it is now our time,</li>
  <li class="number">That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper,</li>
  <li>To cry, good joy: good joy, my lord and lady!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRATIANO">
  <li>My lord Bassanio and my gentle lady,</li>
  <li>I wish you all the joy that you can wish;</li>
  <li>For I am sure you can wish none from me:</li>
  <li class="number">And when your honours mean to solemnize</li>
  <li>The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you,</li>
  <li>Even at that time I may be married too.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRATIANO">
  <li>I thank your lordship, you have got me one.</li>
  <li class="number">My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:</li>
  <li>You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid;</li>
  <li>You loved, I loved for intermission.</li>
  <li>No more pertains to me, my lord, than you.</li>
  <li>Your fortune stood upon the casket there,</li>
  <li class="number">And so did mine too, as the matter falls;</li>
  <li>For wooing here until I sweat again,</li>
  <li>And sweating until my very roof was dry</li>
  <li>With oaths of love, at last, if promise last,</li>
  <li>I got a promise of this fair one here</li>
  <li class="number">To have her love, provided that your fortune</li>
  <li>Achieved her mistress.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>Is this true, Nerissa?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NERISSA">
  <li>Madam, it is, so you stand pleased withal.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRATIANO">
  <li class="number">Yes, faith, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>Our feast shall be much honour’d in your marriage.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRATIANO">
  <li>We’ll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NERISSA">
  <li>What, and stake down?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRATIANO">
  <li>No; we shall ne’er win at that sport, and stake down.</li>
  <li class="number">But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel? What,</li>
  <li>and my old Venetian friend Salerio?</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter LORENZO, JESSICA, and SALERIO, a Messenger
from Venice</div>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither;</li>
  <li>If that the youth of my new interest here</li>
  <li>Have power to bid you welcome. By your leave,</li>
  <li class="number">I bid my very friends and countrymen,</li>
  <li>Sweet Portia, welcome.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>So do I, my lord:</li>
  <li>They are entirely welcome.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORENZO">
  <li>I thank your honour. For my part, my lord,</li>
  <li class="number">My purpose was not to have seen you here;</li>
  <li>But meeting with Salerio by the way,</li>
  <li>He did entreat me, past all saying nay,</li>
  <li>To come with him along.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALERIO">
  <li>I did, my lord;</li>
  <li class="number">And I have reason for it. Signior Antonio</li>
  <li>Commends him to you.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Gives Bassanio a letter</div>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>Ere I ope his letter,</li>
  <li>I pray you, tell me how my good friend doth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALERIO">
  <li>Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind;</li>
  <li class="number">Nor well, unless in mind: his letter there</li>
  <li>Will show you his estate.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRATIANO">
  <li>Nerissa, cheer yon stranger; bid her welcome.</li>
  <li>Your hand, Salerio: what’s the news from Venice?</li>
  <li>How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?</li>
  <li class="number">I know he will be glad of our success;</li>
  <li>We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALERIO">
  <li>I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>There are some shrewd contents in yon same paper,</li>
  <li>That steals the colour from Bassanio’s cheek:</li>
  <li class="number">Some dear friend dead; else nothing in the world</li>
  <li>Could turn so much the constitution</li>
  <li>Of any constant man. What, worse and worse!</li>
  <li>With leave, Bassanio: I am half yourself,</li>
  <li>And I must freely have the half of anything</li>
  <li class="number">That this same paper brings you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>O sweet Portia,</li>
  <li>Here are a few of the unpleasant’st words</li>
  <li>That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,</li>
  <li>When I did first impart my love to you,</li>
  <li class="number">I freely told you, all the wealth I had</li>
  <li>Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman;</li>
  <li>And then I told you true: and yet, dear lady,</li>
  <li>Rating myself at nothing, you shall see</li>
  <li>How much I was a braggart. When I told you</li>
  <li class="number">My state was nothing, I should then have told you</li>
  <li>That I was worse than nothing; for, indeed,</li>
  <li>I have engaged myself to a dear friend,</li>
  <li>Engaged my friend to his mere enemy,</li>
  <li>To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady;</li>
  <li class="number">The paper as the body of my friend,</li>
  <li>And every word in it a gaping wound,</li>
  <li>Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?</li>
  <li>Have all his ventures fail’d? What, not one hit?</li>
  <li>From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,</li>
  <li class="number">From Lisbon, Barbary and India?</li>
  <li>And not one vessel ’scape the dreadful touch</li>
  <li>Of merchant-marring rocks?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALERIO">
  <li>Not one, my lord.</li>
  <li>Besides, it should appear, that if he had</li>
  <li class="number">The present money to discharge the Jew,</li>
  <li>He would not take it. Never did I know</li>
  <li>A creature, that did bear the shape of man,</li>
  <li>So keen and greedy to confound a man:</li>
  <li>He plies the duke at morning and at night,</li>
  <li class="number">And doth impeach the freedom of the state,</li>
  <li>If they deny him justice: twenty merchants,</li>
  <li>The duke himself, and the magnificoes</li>
  <li>Of greatest port, have all persuaded with him;</li>
  <li>But none can drive him from the envious plea</li>
  <li class="number">Of forfeiture, of justice and his bond.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JESSICA">
  <li>When I was with him I have heard him swear</li>
  <li>To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,</li>
  <li>That he would rather have Antonio’s flesh</li>
  <li>Than twenty times the value of the sum</li>
  <li class="number">That he did owe him: and I know, my lord,</li>
  <li>If law, authority and power deny not,</li>
  <li>It will go hard with poor Antonio.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,</li>
  <li class="number">The best-condition’d and unwearied spirit</li>
  <li>In doing courtesies, and one in whom</li>
  <li>The ancient Roman honour more appears</li>
  <li>Than any that draws breath in Italy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>What sum owes he the Jew?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li class="number">For me three thousand ducats.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>What, no more?</li>
  <li>Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond;</li>
  <li>Double six thousand, and then treble that,</li>
  <li>Before a friend of this description</li>
  <li class="number">Shall lose a hair through Bassanio’s fault.</li>
  <li>First go with me to church and call me wife,</li>
  <li>And then away to Venice to your friend;</li>
  <li>For never shall you lie by Portia’s side</li>
  <li>With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold</li>
  <li class="number">To pay the petty debt twenty times over:</li>
  <li>When it is paid, bring your true friend along.</li>
  <li>My maid Nerissa and myself meantime</li>
  <li>Will live as maids and widows. Come, away!</li>
  <li>For you shall hence upon your wedding-day:</li>
  <li class="number">Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer:</li>
  <li>Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear.</li>
  <li>But let me hear the letter of your friend.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li><span class="stage-direction">Reads</span>  Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all</li>
  <li>miscarried, my creditors grow cruel, my estate is</li>
  <li class="number">very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit; and since</li>
  <li>in paying it, it is impossible I should live, all</li>
  <li>debts are cleared between you and I, if I might but</li>
  <li>see you at my death. Notwithstanding, use your</li>
  <li>pleasure: if your love do not persuade you to come,</li>
  <li class="number">let not my letter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>O love, dispatch all business, and be gone!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>Since I have your good leave to go away,</li>
  <li>I will make haste: but, till I come again,</li>
  <li>No bed shall e’er be guilty of my stay,</li>
  <li class="number">No rest be interposer ’twixt us twain.</li>

<h3>SCENE III.  Venice. A street.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter SHYLOCK, SALARINO, ANTONIO, and Gaoler</div>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">

  <li>Thou call’dst me dog before thou hadst a cause;</li>
  <li>But, since I am a dog, beware my fangs:</li>
  <li>The duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder,</li>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>I pray thee, hear me speak.</li>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li>I’ll have my bond; I will not hear thee speak:</li>
  <li>I’ll have my bond; and therefore speak no more.</li>

  <li>He seeks my life; his reason well I know:</li>

  <li>Therefore he hates me.</li>

<ol data-speaker="SALARINO">
  <li>I am sure the duke</li>

  <li>The duke cannot deny the course of law:</li>
  <li class="number">For the commodity that strangers have</li>
  <li>With us in Venice, if it be denied,</li>

  <li>Madam, although I speak it in your presence,</li>
  <li>You have a noble and a true conceit</li>
  <li>Of godlike amity; which appears most strongly</li>
  <li>In bearing thus the absence of your lord.</li>
  <li class="number">But if you knew to whom you show this honour,</li>
  <li>How true a gentleman you send relief,</li>
  <li>How dear a lover of my lord your husband,</li>

  <li>Than customary bounty can enforce you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li class="number">I never did repent for doing good,</li>
  <li>Nor shall not now: for in companions</li>
  <li>That do converse and waste the time together,</li>
  <li>Whose souls do bear an equal yoke Of love,</li>
  <li>There must be needs a like proportion</li>
  <li class="number">Of lineaments, of manners and of spirit;</li>
  <li>Which makes me think that this Antonio,</li>
  <li>Being the bosom lover of my lord,</li>
  <li>Must needs be like my lord. If it be so,</li>
  <li>How little is the cost I have bestow’d</li>
  <li class="number">In purchasing the semblance of my soul</li>
  <li>From out the state of hellish misery!</li>
  <li>This comes too near the praising of myself;</li>
  <li>Therefore no more of it: hear other things.</li>
  <li>Lorenzo, I commit into your hands</li>
  <li class="number">The husbandry and manage of my house</li>
  <li>Until my lord’s return: for mine own part,</li>

  <li>I could not do withal; then I’ll repent,</li>
  <li class="number">And wish for all that, that I had not killed them;</li>
  <li>And twenty of these puny lies I’ll tell,</li>

<ol data-speaker="LAUNCELOT">
  <li>Yes, truly; for, look you, the sins of the father</li>
  <li>are to be laid upon the children: therefore, I</li>
  <li>promise ye, I fear you. I was always plain with</li>
  <li>you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter:</li>
  <li class="number">therefore be of good cheer, for truly I think you</li>
  <li>are damned. There is but one hope in it that can do</li>
  <li>you any good; and that is but a kind of bastard</li>
  <li>hope neither.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JESSICA">
  <li>And what hope is that, I pray thee?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAUNCELOT">
  <li class="number">Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you</li>
  <li>not, that you are not the Jew’s daughter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JESSICA">
  <li>That were a kind of bastard hope, indeed: so the</li>
  <li>sins of my mother should be visited upon me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAUNCELOT">
  <li>Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and</li>
  <li class="number">mother: thus when I shun Scylla, your father, I</li>
  <li>fall into Charybdis, your mother: well, you are</li>
  <li>gone both ways.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JESSICA">
  <li>I shall be saved by my husband; he hath made me a</li>
  <li>Christian.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAUNCELOT">
  <li class="number">Truly, the more to blame he: we were Christians</li>
  <li>enow before; e’en as many as could well live, one by</li>
  <li>another. This making Christians will raise the</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter LORENZO</div>

  <li>you thus get my wife into corners.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JESSICA">
  <li>Nay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo: Launcelot and I</li>
  <li>are out. He tells me flatly, there is no mercy for</li>
  <li class="number">me in heaven, because I am a Jew’s daughter: and he</li>
  <li>says, you are no good member of the commonwealth,</li>
  <li>for in converting Jews to Christians, you raise the</li>
  <li>price of pork.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORENZO">
  <li>I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAUNCELOT">
  <li>It is much that the Moor should be more than reason:</li>
  <li>but if she be less than an honest woman, she is</li>

<ol data-speaker="LORENZO">
  <li class="number">How every fool can play upon the word! I think the</li>

  <li>That is done, sir; they have all stomachs.</li>

  <li>That is done too, sir; only ’cover’ is the word.</li>

<ol data-speaker="LAUNCELOT">
  <li>Not so, sir, neither; I know my duty.</li>

<ol data-speaker="LORENZO">
  <li class="number">Yet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show</li>
  <li>the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant? I pray</li>
  <li>tree, understand a plain man in his plain meaning:</li>
  <li>go to thy fellows; bid them cover the table, serve</li>
  <li>in the meat, and we will come in to dinner.</li>

  <li>I am sorry for thee: thou art come to answer</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>I have heard</li>

  <li>Out of his envy’s reach, I do oppose</li>

  <li>Make room, and let him stand before our face.</li>
  <li>Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,</li>
  <li>That thou but lead’st this fashion of thy malice</li>
  <li class="number">To the last hour of act; and then ’tis thought</li>
  <li>Thou’lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange</li>
  <li>Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;</li>
  <li>And where thou now exact’st the penalty,</li>
  <li>Which is a pound of this poor merchant’s flesh,</li>
  <li class="number">Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,</li>
  <li>But, touch’d with human gentleness and love,</li>
  <li>Forgive a moiety of the principal;</li>
  <li>Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,</li>
  <li>That have of late so huddled on his back,</li>
  <li class="number">Enow to press a royal merchant down</li>
  <li>And pluck commiseration of his state</li>
  <li>From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,</li>
  <li>From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never train’d</li>
  <li>To offices of tender courtesy.</li>
  <li class="number">We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li>I have possess’d your grace of what I purpose;</li>
  <li>And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn</li>
  <li>To have the due and forfeit of my bond:</li>
  <li>If you deny it, let the danger light</li>
  <li class="number">Upon your charter and your city’s freedom.</li>
  <li>You’ll ask me, why I rather choose to have</li>
  <li>A weight of carrion flesh than to receive</li>
  <li>Three thousand ducats: I’ll not answer that:</li>
  <li>But, say, it is my humour: is it answer’d?</li>
  <li class="number">What if my house be troubled with a rat</li>
  <li>And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats</li>
  <li>To have it baned? What, are you answer’d yet?</li>
  <li>Some men there are love not a gaping pig;</li>
  <li>Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;</li>
  <li class="number">And others, when the bagpipe sings i’ the nose,</li>
  <li>Cannot contain their urine: for affection,</li>
  <li>Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood</li>
  <li>Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:</li>
  <li>As there is no firm reason to be render’d,</li>
  <li class="number">Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;</li>
  <li>Why he, a harmless necessary cat;</li>
  <li>Why he, a woollen bagpipe; but of force</li>
  <li>Must yield to such inevitable shame</li>
  <li>As to offend, himself being offended;</li>
  <li class="number">So can I give no reason, nor I will not,</li>
  <li>More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing</li>
  <li>I bear Antonio, that I follow thus</li>
  <li>A losing suit against him. Are you answer’d?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,</li>

  <li>I pray you, think you question with the Jew:</li>

  <li>You may as well use question with the wolf</li>
  <li class="number">Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;</li>
  <li>You may as well forbid the mountain pines</li>
  <li>To wag their high tops and to make no noise,</li>
  <li>When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;</li>
  <li>You may as well do anything most hard,</li>
  <li class="number">As seek to soften that — than which what’s harder? — </li>
  <li>His Jewish heart: therefore, I do beseech you,</li>
  <li>Make no more offers, use no farther means,</li>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li class="number">What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?</li>
  <li>You have among you many a purchased slave,</li>

  <li>Because you bought them: shall I say to you,</li>

  <li>Why sweat they under burthens? let their beds</li>

  <li>’The slaves are ours:’ so do I answer you:</li>
  <li class="number">The pound of flesh, which I demand of him,</li>
  <li>Is dearly bought; ’tis mine and I will have it.</li>
  <li>If you deny me, fie upon your law!</li>

  <li>Thou almost makest me waver in my faith</li>

  <li>acceptance, whose trial shall better publish his</li>
  <li>commendation.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE">
  <li class="number">You hear the learn’d Bellario, what he writes:</li>
  <li>And here, I take it, is the doctor come.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter PORTIA, dressed like a doctor of laws</li>
  <li>Give me your hand. Come you from old Bellario?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>I did, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE">
  <li>You are welcome: take your place.</li>
  <li class="number">Are you acquainted with the difference</li>
  <li>That holds this present question in the court?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>I am informed thoroughly of the cause.</li>
  <li>Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE">
  <li>Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li class="number">Is your name Shylock?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li>Shylock is my name.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;</li>
  <li>Yet in such rule that the Venetian law</li>
  <li>Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.</li>
  <li class="number">You stand within his danger, do you not?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>Ay, so he says.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>Do you confess the bond?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>I do.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>Then must the Jew be merciful.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li class="number">On what compulsion must I? tell me that.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>The quality of mercy is not strain’d,</li>
  <li>It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven</li>
  <li>Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest;</li>
  <li>It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:</li>
  <li class="number">’Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes</li>
  <li>The throned monarch better than his crown;</li>
  <li>His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,</li>
  <li>The attribute to awe and majesty,</li>
  <li>Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;</li>
  <li class="number">But mercy is above this sceptred sway;</li>
  <li>It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,</li>
  <li>It is an attribute to God himself;</li>
  <li>And earthly power doth then show likest God’s</li>
  <li>When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,</li>
  <li class="number">Though justice be thy plea, consider this,</li>
  <li>That, in the course of justice, none of us</li>
  <li>Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;</li>
  <li>And that same prayer doth teach us all to render</li>
  <li>The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much</li>
  <li class="number">To mitigate the justice of thy plea;</li>
  <li>Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice</li>
  <li>Must needs give sentence ’gainst the merchant there.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li>My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,</li>
  <li>The penalty and forfeit of my bond.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li class="number">Is he not able to discharge the money?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>Yes, here I tender it for him in the court;</li>
  <li>Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,</li>
  <li>I will be bound to pay it ten times o’er,</li>
  <li>On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:</li>
  <li class="number">If this will not suffice, it must appear</li>
  <li>That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,</li>
  <li>Wrest once the law to your authority:</li>
  <li>To do a great right, do a little wrong,</li>
  <li>And curb this cruel devil of his will.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li class="number">It must not be; there is no power in Venice</li>
  <li>Can alter a decree established:</li>
  <li>’Twill be recorded for a precedent,</li>
  <li>And many an error by the same example</li>
  <li>Will rush into the state: it cannot be.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li class="number">A Daniel come to judgment! yea, a Daniel!</li>
  <li>O wise young judge, how I do honour thee!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>I pray you, let me look upon the bond.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li>Here ’tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>Shylock, there’s thrice thy money offer’d thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li class="number">An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven:</li>
  <li>Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?</li>
  <li>No, not for Venice.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>Why, this bond is forfeit;</li>
  <li>And lawfully by this the Jew may claim</li>
  <li class="number">A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off</li>
  <li>Nearest the merchant’s heart. Be merciful:</li>
  <li>Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li>When it is paid according to the tenor.</li>
  <li>It doth appear you are a worthy judge;</li>
  <li class="number">You know the law, your exposition</li>
  <li>Hath been most sound: I charge you by the law,</li>
  <li>Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,</li>
  <li>Proceed to judgment: by my soul I swear</li>
  <li>There is no power in the tongue of man</li>
  <li class="number">To alter me: I stay here on my bond.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>Most heartily I do beseech the court</li>
  <li>To give the judgment.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>Why then, thus it is:</li>
  <li>You must prepare your bosom for his knife.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li class="number">O noble judge! O excellent young man!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>For the intent and purpose of the law</li>
  <li>Hath full relation to the penalty,</li>
  <li>Which here appeareth due upon the bond.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li>’Tis very true: O wise and upright judge!</li>
  <li class="number">How much more elder art thou than thy looks!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>Therefore lay bare your bosom.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li>Ay, his breast:</li>
  <li>So says the bond: doth it not, noble judge?</li>
  <li>’Nearest his heart:’ those are the very words.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li class="number">It is so. Are there balance here to weigh</li>
  <li>The flesh?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li>I have them ready.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,</li>
  <li>To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li class="number">Is it so nominated in the bond?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>It is not so express’d: but what of that?</li>
  <li>’Twere good you do so much for charity.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li>I cannot find it; ’tis not in the bond.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>You, merchant, have you any thing to say?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li class="number">But little: I am arm’d and well prepared.</li>
  <li>Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well!</li>
  <li>Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;</li>
  <li>For herein Fortune shows herself more kind</li>
  <li>Than is her custom: it is still her use</li>
  <li class="number">To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,</li>
  <li>To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow</li>
  <li>An age of poverty; from which lingering penance</li>
  <li>Of such misery doth she cut me off.</li>
  <li>Commend me to your honourable wife:</li>
  <li class="number">Tell her the process of Antonio’s end;</li>
  <li>Say how I loved you, speak me fair in death;</li>
  <li>And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge</li>
  <li>Whether Bassanio had not once a love.</li>
  <li>Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,</li>
  <li class="number">And he repents not that he pays your debt;</li>
  <li>For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,</li>
  <li>I’ll pay it presently with all my heart.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>Antonio, I am married to a wife</li>
  <li>Which is as dear to me as life itself;</li>
  <li class="number">But life itself, my wife, and all the world,</li>
  <li>Are not with me esteem’d above thy life:</li>
  <li>I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all</li>
  <li>Here to this devil, to deliver you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>Your wife would give you little thanks for that,</li>
  <li class="number">If she were by, to hear you make the offer.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRATIANO">
  <li>I have a wife, whom, I protest, I love:</li>
  <li>I would she were in heaven, so she could</li>
  <li>Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NERISSA">
  <li>’Tis well you offer it behind her back;</li>
  <li class="number">The wish would make else an unquiet house.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li>These be the Christian husbands. I have a daughter;</li>
  <li>Would any of the stock of Barrabas</li>
  <li>Had been her husband rather than a Christian!</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Aside</li>
  <li>We trifle time: I pray thee, pursue sentence.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li class="number">A pound of that same merchant’s flesh is thine:</li>
  <li>The court awards it, and the law doth give it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li>Most rightful judge!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>And you must cut this flesh from off his breast:</li>
  <li>The law allows it, and the court awards it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li class="number">Most learned judge! A sentence! Come, prepare!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>Tarry a little; there is something else.</li>
  <li>This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood;</li>
  <li>The words expressly are ’a pound of flesh:’</li>
  <li>Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh;</li>
  <li class="number">But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed</li>
  <li>One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods</li>
  <li>Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate</li>
  <li>Unto the state of Venice.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRATIANO">
  <li>O upright judge! Mark, Jew: O learned judge!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li class="number">Is that the law?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>Thyself shalt see the act:</li>
  <li>For, as thou urgest justice, be assured</li>
  <li>Thou shalt have justice, more than thou desirest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRATIANO">
  <li>O learned judge! Mark, Jew: a learned judge!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li class="number">I take this offer, then; pay the bond thrice</li>
  <li>And let the Christian go.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>Here is the money.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>Soft!</li>
  <li>The Jew shall have all justice; soft! no haste:</li>
  <li class="number">He shall have nothing but the penalty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRATIANO">
  <li>O Jew! an upright judge, a learned judge!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.</li>
  <li>Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more</li>
  <li>But just a pound of flesh: if thou cut’st more</li>
  <li class="number">Or less than a just pound, be it but so much</li>
  <li>As makes it light or heavy in the substance,</li>
  <li>Or the division of the twentieth part</li>
  <li>Of one poor scruple, nay, if the scale do turn</li>
  <li>But in the estimation of a hair,</li>
  <li class="number">Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRATIANO">
  <li>A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!</li>
  <li>Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>Why doth the Jew pause? take thy forfeiture.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li>Give me my principal, and let me go.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li class="number">I have it ready for thee; here it is.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>He hath refused it in the open court:</li>
  <li>He shall have merely justice and his bond.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRATIANO">
  <li>A Daniel, still say I, a second Daniel!</li>
  <li>I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li class="number">Shall I not have barely my principal?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture,</li>
  <li>To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li>Why, then the devil give him good of it!</li>
  <li>I’ll stay no longer question.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li class="number">Tarry, Jew:</li>
  <li>The law hath yet another hold on you.</li>
  <li>It is enacted in the laws of Venice,</li>
  <li>If it be proved against an alien</li>
  <li>That by direct or indirect attempts</li>
  <li class="number">He seek the life of any citizen,</li>
  <li>The party ’gainst the which he doth contrive</li>
  <li>Shall seize one half his goods; the other half</li>
  <li>Comes to the privy coffer of the state;</li>
  <li>And the offender’s life lies in the mercy</li>
  <li class="number">Of the duke only, ’gainst all other voice.</li>
  <li>In which predicament, I say, thou stand’st;</li>
  <li>For it appears, by manifest proceeding,</li>
  <li>That indirectly and directly too</li>
  <li>Thou hast contrived against the very life</li>
  <li class="number">Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr’d</li>
  <li>The danger formerly by me rehearsed.</li>
  <li>Down therefore and beg mercy of the duke.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRATIANO">
  <li>Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself:</li>
  <li>And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state,</li>
  <li class="number">Thou hast not left the value of a cord;</li>
  <li>Therefore thou must be hang’d at the state’s charge.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE">
  <li>That thou shalt see the difference of our spirits,</li>
  <li>I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it:</li>
  <li>For half thy wealth, it is Antonio’s;</li>
  <li class="number">The other half comes to the general state,</li>
  <li>Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>Ay, for the state, not for Antonio.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li>Nay, take my life and all; pardon not that:</li>
  <li>You take my house when you do take the prop</li>
  <li class="number">That doth sustain my house; you take my life</li>
  <li>When you do take the means whereby I live.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>What mercy can you render him, Antonio?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRATIANO">
  <li>A halter gratis; nothing else, for God’s sake.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>So please my lord the duke and all the court</li>
  <li class="number">To quit the fine for one half of his goods,</li>
  <li>I am content; so he will let me have</li>
  <li>The other half in use, to render it,</li>
  <li>Upon his death, unto the gentleman</li>
  <li>That lately stole his daughter:</li>
  <li class="number">Two things provided more, that, for this favour,</li>
  <li>He presently become a Christian;</li>
  <li>The other, that he do record a gift,</li>
  <li>Here in the court, of all he dies possess’d,</li>
  <li>Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE">
  <li class="number">He shall do this, or else I do recant</li>
  <li>The pardon that I late pronounced here.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>Art thou contented, Jew? what dost thou say?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li>I am content.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>Clerk, draw a deed of gift.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHYLOCK">
  <li class="number">I pray you, give me leave to go from hence;</li>
  <li>I am not well: send the deed after me,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE">
  <li>Get thee gone, but do it.</li>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further:</li>

  <li>Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife;</li>

<ol data-speaker="LORENZO">
  <li>The moon shines bright: in such a night as this,</li>
  <li>When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees</li>
  <li>And they did make no noise, in such a night</li>
  <li>Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls</li>
  <li class="number">And sigh’d his soul toward the Grecian tents,</li>
  <li>Where Cressid lay that night.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JESSICA">
  <li>In such a night</li>
  <li>Did Thisbe fearfully o’ertrip the dew</li>
  <li>And saw the lion’s shadow ere himself</li>
  <li class="number">And ran dismay’d away.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORENZO">
  <li>In such a night</li>
  <li>Stood Dido with a willow in her hand</li>
  <li>Upon the wild sea banks and waft her love</li>
  <li>To come again to Carthage.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JESSICA">
  <li class="number">In such a night</li>
  <li>Medea gather’d the enchanted herbs</li>
  <li>That did renew old AEson.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORENZO">
  <li>In such a night</li>
  <li>Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew</li>
  <li class="number">And with an unthrift love did run from Venice</li>
  <li>As far as Belmont.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JESSICA">
  <li>In such a night</li>
  <li>Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well,</li>
  <li>Stealing her soul with many vows of faith</li>
  <li class="number">And ne’er a true one.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORENZO">
  <li>In such a night</li>
  <li>Did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew,</li>
  <li>Slander her love, and he forgave it her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JESSICA">
  <li>I would out-night you, did no body come;</li>
  <li class="number">But, hark, I hear the footing of a man.</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter STEPHANO</div>

<ol data-speaker="LORENZO">
  <li>Who comes so fast in silence of the night?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="STEPHANO">
  <li>A friend.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORENZO">
  <li>A friend! what friend? your name, I pray you, friend?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="STEPHANO">
  <li>Stephano is my name; and I bring word</li>
  <li class="number">My mistress will before the break of day</li>
  <li>Be here at Belmont; she doth stray about</li>
  <li>By holy crosses, where she kneels and prays</li>
  <li>For happy wedlock hours.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORENZO">
  <li>Who comes with her?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="STEPHANO">
  <li class="number">None but a holy hermit and her maid.</li>
  <li>I pray you, is my master yet return’d?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORENZO">
  <li>He is not, nor we have not heard from him.</li>
  <li>But go we in, I pray thee, Jessica,</li>
  <li>And ceremoniously let us prepare</li>
  <li class="number">Some welcome for the mistress of the house.</li>

  <li>Sola! did you see Master Lorenzo?</li>
  <li>Master Lorenzo, sola, sola!</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAUNCELOT">
  <li>Sola! where? where?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORENZO">
  <li>Here.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAUNCELOT">
  <li>Tell him there’s a post come from my master, with</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<ol data-speaker="LORENZO">
  <li>Sweet soul, let’s in, and there expect their coming.</li>
  <li>And yet no matter: why should we go in?</li>
  <li>My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you,</li>
  <li>Within the house, your mistress is at hand;</li>
  <li class="number">And bring your music forth into the air.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exit Stephano</li>
  <li>How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!</li>
  <li>Here will we sit and let the sounds of music</li>
  <li>Creep in our ears: soft stillness and the night</li>
  <li>Become the touches of sweet harmony.</li>
  <li class="number">Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven</li>
  <li>Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold:</li>
  <li>There’s not the smallest orb which thou behold’st</li>
  <li>But in his motion like an angel sings,</li>
  <li>Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins;</li>
  <li class="number">Such harmony is in immortal souls;</li>
  <li>But whilst this muddy vesture of decay</li>
  <li>Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter Musicians</li>
  <li>Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn!</li>
  <li>With sweetest touches pierce your mistress’ ear,</li>
  <li class="number">And draw her home with music.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Music</div>

<ol data-speaker="JESSICA">
  <li>I am never merry when I hear sweet music.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORENZO">
  <li>The reason is, your spirits are attentive:</li>
  <li>For do but note a wild and wanton herd,</li>
  <li>Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,</li>
  <li class="number">Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,</li>
  <li>Which is the hot condition of their blood;</li>
  <li>If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,</li>
  <li>Or any air of music touch their ears,</li>
  <li>You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,</li>
  <li class="number">Their savage eyes turn’d to a modest gaze</li>
  <li>By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet</li>
  <li>Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones and floods;</li>
  <li>Since nought so stockish, hard and full of rage,</li>
  <li>But music for the time doth change his nature.</li>
  <li class="number">The man that hath no music in himself,</li>
  <li>Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,</li>
  <li>Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils;</li>
  <li>The motions of his spirit are dull as night</li>
  <li>And his affections dark as Erebus:</li>
  <li class="number">Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter PORTIA and NERISSA</div>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>That light we see is burning in my hall.</li>
  <li>How far that little candle throws his beams!</li>
  <li>So shines a good deed in a naughty world.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NERISSA">
  <li>When the moon shone, we did not see the candle.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li class="number">So doth the greater glory dim the less:</li>
  <li>A substitute shines brightly as a king</li>
  <li>Unto the king be by, and then his state</li>
  <li>Empties itself, as doth an inland brook</li>
  <li>Into the main of waters. Music! hark!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NERISSA">
  <li class="number">It is your music, madam, of the house.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>Nothing is good, I see, without respect:</li>
  <li>Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NERISSA">
  <li>Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark,</li>
  <li class="number">When neither is attended, and I think</li>
  <li>The nightingale, if she should sing by day,</li>
  <li>When every goose is cackling, would be thought</li>
  <li>No better a musician than the wren.</li>
  <li>How many things by season season’d are</li>
  <li class="number">To their right praise and true perfection!</li>
  <li>Peace, ho! the moon sleeps with Endymion</li>
  <li>And would not be awaked.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Music ceases</div>

<ol data-speaker="LORENZO">
  <li>That is the voice,</li>
  <li>Or I am much deceived, of Portia.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li class="number">He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo,</li>
  <li>By the bad voice.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORENZO">
  <li>Dear lady, welcome home.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>We have been praying for our husbands’ healths,</li>
  <li>Which speed, we hope, the better for our words.</li>
  <li class="number">Are they return’d?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORENZO">
  <li>Madam, they are not yet;</li>
  <li>But there is come a messenger before,</li>
  <li>To signify their coming.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>Go in, Nerissa;</li>
  <li class="number">Give order to my servants that they take</li>
  <li>No note at all of our being absent hence;</li>
  <li>Nor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">A tucket sounds</div>

<ol data-speaker="LORENZO">
  <li>Your husband is at hand; I hear his trumpet:</li>
  <li>We are no tell-tales, madam; fear you not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li class="number">This night methinks is but the daylight sick;</li>
  <li>It looks a little paler: ’tis a day,</li>
  <li>Such as the day is when the sun is hid.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter BASSANIO, ANTONIO, GRATIANO, and
their followers</div>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>We should hold day with the Antipodes,</li>
  <li>If you would walk in absence of the sun.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li class="number">Let me give light, but let me not be light;</li>
  <li>For a light wife doth make a heavy husband,</li>
  <li>And never be Bassanio so for me:</li>
  <li>But God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>I thank you, madam. Give welcome to my friend.</li>
  <li class="number">This is the man, this is Antonio,</li>
  <li>To whom I am so infinitely bound.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>You should in all sense be much bound to him.</li>
  <li>For, as I hear, he was much bound for you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>No more than I am well acquitted of.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li class="number">Sir, you are very welcome to our house:</li>
  <li>It must appear in other ways than words,</li>
  <li>Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRATIANO">
  <li><stagedir>To NERISSA</stagedir>  By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong;</li>
  <li>In faith, I gave it to the judge’s clerk:</li>
  <li class="number">Would he were gelt that had it, for my part,</li>
  <li>Since you do take it, love, so much at heart.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>A quarrel, ho, already! what’s the matter?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRATIANO">
  <li>About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring</li>
  <li>That she did give me, whose posy was</li>
  <li class="number">For all the world like cutler’s poetry</li>
  <li>Upon a knife, ’Love me, and leave me not.’</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NERISSA">
  <li>What talk you of the posy or the value?</li>
  <li>You swore to me, when I did give it you,</li>
  <li>That you would wear it till your hour of death</li>
  <li class="number">And that it should lie with you in your grave:</li>
  <li>Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,</li>
  <li>You should have been respective and have kept it.</li>
  <li>Gave it a judge’s clerk! no, God’s my judge,</li>
  <li>The clerk will ne’er wear hair on’s face that had it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRATIANO">
  <li class="number">He will, an if he live to be a man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NERISSA">
  <li>Ay, if a woman live to be a man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRATIANO">
  <li>Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,</li>
  <li>A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy,</li>
  <li>No higher than thyself; the judge’s clerk,</li>
  <li class="number">A prating boy, that begg’d it as a fee:</li>
  <li>I could not for my heart deny it him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>You were to blame, I must be plain with you,</li>
  <li>To part so slightly with your wife’s first gift:</li>
  <li>A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger</li>
  <li class="number">And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.</li>
  <li>I gave my love a ring and made him swear</li>
  <li>Never to part with it; and here he stands;</li>
  <li>I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it</li>
  <li>Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth</li>
  <li class="number">That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano,</li>
  <li>You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief:</li>
  <li>An ’twere to me, I should be mad at it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li><span class="stage-direction">Aside</span>  Why, I were best to cut my left hand off</li>
  <li>And swear I lost the ring defending it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRATIANO">
  <li class="number">My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away</li>
  <li>Unto the judge that begg’d it and indeed</li>
  <li>Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,</li>
  <li>That took some pains in writing, he begg’d mine;</li>
  <li>And neither man nor master would take aught</li>
  <li class="number">But the two rings.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>What ring gave you my lord?</li>
  <li>Not that, I hope, which you received of me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>If I could add a lie unto a fault,</li>
  <li>I would deny it; but you see my finger</li>
  <li class="number">Hath not the ring upon it; it is gone.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>Even so void is your false heart of truth.</li>
  <li>By heaven, I will ne’er come in your bed</li>
  <li>Until I see the ring.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NERISSA">
  <li>Nor I in yours</li>
  <li class="number">Till I again see mine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>Sweet Portia,</li>
  <li>If you did know to whom I gave the ring,</li>
  <li>If you did know for whom I gave the ring</li>
  <li>And would conceive for what I gave the ring</li>
  <li class="number">And how unwillingly I left the ring,</li>
  <li>When nought would be accepted but the ring,</li>
  <li>You would abate the strength of your displeasure.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>If you had known the virtue of the ring,</li>
  <li>Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,</li>
  <li class="number">Or your own honour to contain the ring,</li>
  <li>You would not then have parted with the ring.</li>
  <li>What man is there so much unreasonable,</li>
  <li>If you had pleased to have defended it</li>
  <li>With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty</li>
  <li class="number">To urge the thing held as a ceremony?</li>
  <li>Nerissa teaches me what to believe:</li>
  <li>I’ll die for’t but some woman had the ring.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,</li>
  <li>No woman had it, but a civil doctor,</li>
  <li class="number">Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me</li>
  <li>And begg’d the ring; the which I did deny him</li>
  <li>And suffer’d him to go displeased away;</li>
  <li>Even he that did uphold the very life</li>
  <li>Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?</li>
  <li class="number">I was enforced to send it after him;</li>
  <li>I was beset with shame and courtesy;</li>
  <li>My honour would not let ingratitude</li>
  <li>So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady;</li>
  <li>For, by these blessed candles of the night,</li>
  <li class="number">Had you been there, I think you would have begg’d</li>
  <li>The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>Let not that doctor e’er come near my house:</li>
  <li>Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,</li>
  <li>And that which you did swear to keep for me,</li>
  <li class="number">I will become as liberal as you;</li>
  <li>I’ll not deny him any thing I have,</li>
  <li>No, not my body nor my husband’s bed:</li>
  <li>Know him I shall, I am well sure of it:</li>
  <li>Lie not a night from home; watch me like Argus:</li>
  <li class="number">If you do not, if I be left alone,</li>
  <li>Now, by mine honour, which is yet mine own,</li>
  <li>I’ll have that doctor for my bedfellow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NERISSA">
  <li>And I his clerk; therefore be well advised</li>
  <li>How you do leave me to mine own protection.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRATIANO">
  <li class="number">Well, do you so; let not me take him, then;</li>
  <li>For if I do, I’ll mar the young clerk’s pen.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>Sir, grieve not you; you are welcome notwithstanding.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong;</li>
  <li class="number">And, in the hearing of these many friends,</li>
  <li>I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,</li>
  <li>Wherein I see myself — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>Mark you but that!</li>
  <li>In both my eyes he doubly sees himself;</li>
  <li class="number">In each eye, one: swear by your double self,</li>
  <li>And there’s an oath of credit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>Nay, but hear me:</li>
  <li>Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear</li>
  <li>I never more will break an oath with thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li class="number">I once did lend my body for his wealth;</li>
  <li>Which, but for him that had your husband’s ring,</li>
  <li>Had quite miscarried: I dare be bound again,</li>
  <li>My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord</li>
  <li>Will never more break faith advisedly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li class="number">Then you shall be his surety. Give him this</li>
  <li>And bid him keep it better than the other.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>Here, Lord Bassanio; swear to keep this ring.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio;</li>
  <li class="number">For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NERISSA">
  <li>And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano;</li>
  <li>For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor’s clerk,</li>
  <li>In lieu of this last night did lie with me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRATIANO">
  <li>Why, this is like the mending of highways</li>
  <li class="number">In summer, where the ways are fair enough:</li>
  <li>What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>Speak not so grossly. You are all amazed:</li>
  <li>Here is a letter; read it at your leisure;</li>
  <li>It comes from Padua, from Bellario:</li>
  <li class="number">There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,</li>
  <li>Nerissa there her clerk: Lorenzo here</li>
  <li>Shall witness I set forth as soon as you</li>
  <li>And even but now return’d; I have not yet</li>
  <li>Enter’d my house. Antonio, you are welcome;</li>
  <li class="number">And I have better news in store for you</li>
  <li>Than you expect: unseal this letter soon;</li>
  <li>There you shall find three of your argosies</li>
  <li>Are richly come to harbour suddenly:</li>
  <li>You shall not know by what strange accident</li>
  <li class="number">I chanced on this letter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>I am dumb.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>Were you the doctor and I knew you not?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRATIANO">
  <li>Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NERISSA">
  <li>Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,</li>
  <li class="number">Unless he live until he be a man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSANIO">
  <li>Sweet doctor, you shall be my bed-fellow:</li>
  <li>When I am absent, then lie with my wife.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;</li>
  <li>For here I read for certain that my ships</li>
  <li class="number">Are safely come to road.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>How now, Lorenzo!</li>
  <li>My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NERISSA">
  <li>Ay, and I’ll give them him without a fee.</li>
  <li>There do I give to you and Jessica,</li>
  <li class="number">From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,</li>
  <li>After his death, of all he dies possess’d of.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORENZO">
  <li>Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way</li>
  <li>Of starved people.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORTIA">
  <li>It is almost morning,</li>
  <li class="number">And yet I am sure you are not satisfied</li>
  <li>Of these events at full. Let us go in;</li>
  <li>And charge us there upon inter’gatories,</li>
  <li>And we will answer all things faithfully.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRATIANO">
  <li>Let it be so: the first inter’gatory</li>
  <li class="number">That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,</li>
  <li>Whether till the next night she had rather stay,</li>
  <li>Or go to bed now, being two hours to day:</li>
  <li>But were the day come, I should wish it dark,</li>
  <li>That I were couching with the doctor’s clerk.</li>
  <li class="number">Well, while I live I’ll fear no other thing</li>
  <li>So sore as keeping safe Nerissa’s ring.</li>
