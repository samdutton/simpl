<div class="stage-direction">FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO</div>

<ol data-speaker="BERNARDO">
  <li>Who’s there?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FRANCISCO">
  <li>Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BERNARDO">
  <li>Long live the king!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FRANCISCO">
  <li>Bernardo?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BERNARDO">
  <li class="number">He.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FRANCISCO">
  <li>You come most carefully upon your hour.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BERNARDO">
  <li>’Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FRANCISCO">
  <li>For this relief much thanks: ’tis bitter cold,</li>
  <li>And I am sick at heart.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BERNARDO">
  <li class="number">Have you had quiet guard?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FRANCISCO">
  <li>Not a mouse stirring.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BERNARDO">
  <li>Well, good night.</li>
  <li>If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,</li>
  <li>The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.</li>

<ol data-speaker="FRANCISCO">
  <li class="number">I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who’s there?</li>

  <li>O, farewell, honest soldier:</li>
  <li class="number">Who hath relieved you?</li>

<ol data-speaker="FRANCISCO">
  <li>Bernardo has my place.</li>
  <li>Give you good night.</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<ol data-speaker="MARCELLUS">
  <li>Holla! Bernardo!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BERNARDO">
  <li>Say,</li>
  <li class="number">What, is Horatio there?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORATIO">
  <li>A piece of him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BERNARDO">
  <li>Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCELLUS">
  <li>What, has this thing appear’d again to-night?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BERNARDO">
  <li>I have seen nothing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCELLUS">
  <li class="number">Horatio says ’tis but our fantasy,</li>
  <li>And will not let belief take hold of him</li>
  <li>Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:</li>
  <li>Therefore I have entreated him along</li>
  <li>With us to watch the minutes of this night;</li>
  <li class="number">That if again this apparition come,</li>
  <li>He may approve our eyes and speak to it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORATIO">
  <li>Tush, tush, ’twill not appear.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BERNARDO">
  <li>Sit down awhile;</li>
  <li>And let us once again assail your ears,</li>
  <li class="number">That are so fortified against our story</li>
  <li>What we have two nights seen.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORATIO">
  <li>Well, sit we down,</li>
  <li>And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BERNARDO">
  <li>Last night of all,</li>
  <li class="number">When yond same star that’s westward from the pole</li>
  <li>Had made his course to illume that part of heaven</li>
  <li>Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,</li>
  <li>The bell then beating one — </li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter Ghost</div>

<ol data-speaker="MARCELLUS">
  <li>Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BERNARDO">
  <li class="number">In the same figure, like the king that’s dead.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCELLUS">
  <li>Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BERNARDO">
  <li>Looks it not like the king?  mark it, Horatio.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORATIO">
  <li>Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BERNARDO">
  <li>It would be spoke to.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCELLUS">
  <li class="number">Question it, Horatio.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORATIO">
  <li>What art thou that usurp’st this time of night,</li>
  <li>Together with that fair and warlike form</li>
  <li>In which the majesty of buried Denmark</li>
  <li>Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCELLUS">
  <li class="number">It is offended.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BERNARDO">
  <li>See, it stalks away!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORATIO">
  <li>Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit Ghost</div>

<ol data-speaker="MARCELLUS">
  <li>’Tis gone, and will not answer.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BERNARDO">
  <li>How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:</li>
  <li class="number">Is not this something more than fantasy?</li>
  <li>What think you on’t?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORATIO">
  <li>Before my God, I might not this believe</li>
  <li>Without the sensible and true avouch</li>
  <li>Of mine own eyes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCELLUS">
  <li class="number">Is it not like the king?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORATIO">
  <li>As thou art to thyself:</li>
  <li>Such was the very armour he had on</li>
  <li>When he the ambitious Norway combated;</li>
  <li>So frown’d he once, when, in an angry parle,</li>
  <li class="number">He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.</li>
  <li>’Tis strange.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCELLUS">
  <li>Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,</li>
  <li>With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORATIO">
  <li>In what particular thought to work I know not;</li>
  <li class="number">But in the gross and scope of my opinion,</li>
  <li>This bodes some strange eruption to our state.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCELLUS">
  <li>Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,</li>
  <li>Why this same strict and most observant watch</li>
  <li>So nightly toils the subject of the land,</li>
  <li class="number">And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,</li>
  <li>And foreign mart for implements of war;</li>
  <li>Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task</li>
  <li>Does not divide the Sunday from the week;</li>
  <li>What might be toward, that this sweaty haste</li>
  <li class="number">Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:</li>
  <li>Who is’t that can inform me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORATIO">
  <li>That can I;</li>
  <li>At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,</li>
  <li>Whose image even but now appear’d to us,</li>
  <li class="number">Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,</li>
  <li>Thereto prick’d on by a most emulate pride,</li>
  <li>Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet — </li>
  <li>For so this side of our known world esteem’d him — </li>
  <li>Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal’d compact,</li>
  <li class="number">Well ratified by law and heraldry,</li>
  <li>Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands</li>
  <li>Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:</li>
  <li>Against the which, a moiety competent</li>
  <li>Was gaged by our king; which had return’d</li>
  <li class="number">To the inheritance of Fortinbras,</li>
  <li>Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,</li>
  <li>And carriage of the article design’d,</li>
  <li>His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,</li>
  <li>Of unimproved mettle hot and full,</li>
  <li class="number">Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there</li>
  <li>Shark’d up a list of lawless resolutes,</li>
  <li>For food and diet, to some enterprise</li>
  <li>That hath a stomach in’t; which is no other — </li>
  <li>As it doth well appear unto our state — </li>
  <li class="number">But to recover of us, by strong hand</li>
  <li>And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands</li>
  <li>So by his father lost: and this, I take it,</li>
  <li>Is the main motive of our preparations,</li>
  <li>The source of this our watch and the chief head</li>
  <li class="number">Of this post-haste and romage in the land.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BERNARDO">
  <li>I think it be no other but e’en so:</li>
  <li>Well may it sort that this portentous figure</li>
  <li>Comes armed through our watch; so like the king</li>
  <li>That was and is the question of these wars.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORATIO">
  <li class="number">A mote it is to trouble the mind’s eye.</li>
  <li>In the most high and palmy state of Rome,</li>
  <li>A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,</li>
  <li>The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead</li>
  <li>Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:</li>
  <li class="number">As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,</li>
  <li>Disasters in the sun; and the moist star</li>
  <li>Upon whose influence Neptune’s empire stands</li>
  <li>Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:</li>
  <li>And even the like precurse of fierce events,</li>
  <li class="number">As harbingers preceding still the fates</li>
  <li>And prologue to the omen coming on,</li>
  <li>Have heaven and earth together demonstrated</li>
  <li>Unto our climatures and countrymen. — </li>
  <li>But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Re-enter Ghost</li>
  <li class="number">I’ll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!</li>
  <li>If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,</li>
  <li>Speak to me:</li>
  <li>If there be any good thing to be done,</li>
  <li>That may to thee do ease and grace to me,</li>
  <li class="number">Speak to me:</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Cock crows</li>
  <li>If thou art privy to thy country’s fate,</li>
  <li>Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!</li>
  <li>Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life</li>
  <li>Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,</li>
  <li class="number">For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,</li>
  <li>Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCELLUS">
  <li>Shall I strike at it with my partisan?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORATIO">
  <li>Do, if it will not stand.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BERNARDO">
  <li>’Tis here!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORATIO">
  <li class="number">’Tis here!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCELLUS">
  <li>’Tis gone!</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exit Ghost</li>
  <li>We do it wrong, being so majestical,</li>
  <li>To offer it the show of violence;</li>
  <li>For it is, as the air, invulnerable,</li>
  <li class="number">And our vain blows malicious mockery.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BERNARDO">
  <li>It was about to speak, when the cock crew.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORATIO">
  <li>And then it started like a guilty thing</li>
  <li>Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,</li>
  <li>The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,</li>
  <li class="number">Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat</li>
  <li>Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,</li>
  <li>Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,</li>
  <li>The extravagant and erring spirit hies</li>
  <li>To his confine: and of the truth herein</li>
  <li class="number">This present object made probation.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCELLUS">
  <li>It faded on the crowing of the cock.</li>
  <li>Some say that ever ’gainst that season comes</li>
  <li>Wherein our Saviour’s birth is celebrated,</li>
  <li>The bird of dawning singeth all night long:</li>
  <li class="number">And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;</li>
  <li>The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,</li>
  <li>No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,</li>
  <li>So hallow’d and so gracious is the time.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORATIO">
  <li>So have I heard and do in part believe it.</li>
  <li class="number">But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,</li>
  <li>Walks o’er the dew of yon high eastward hill:</li>
  <li>Break we our watch up; and by my advice,</li>
  <li>Let us impart what we have seen to-night</li>
  <li>Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,</li>
  <li class="number">This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.</li>
  <li>Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,</li>
  <li>As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCELLUS">
  <li>Let’s do’t, I pray; and I this morning know</li>
  <li>Where we shall find him most conveniently.</li>
</ol>

<h3>SCENE II.  A room of state in the castle.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET,
POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords,
and Attendants</div>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li>Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother’s death</li>
  <li>The memory be green, and that it us befitted</li>
  <li>To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom</li>
  <li>To be contracted in one brow of woe,</li>
  <li class="number">Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature</li>
  <li>That we with wisest sorrow think on him,</li>
  <li>Together with remembrance of ourselves.</li>
  <li>Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,</li>
  <li>The imperial jointress to this warlike state,</li>
  <li class="number">Have we, as ’twere with a defeated joy — </li>
  <li>With an auspicious and a dropping eye,</li>
  <li>With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,</li>
  <li>In equal scale weighing delight and dole — </li>
  <li>Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr’d</li>
  <li class="number">Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone</li>
  <li>With this affair along. For all, our thanks.</li>
  <li>Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,</li>
  <li>Holding a weak supposal of our worth,</li>
  <li>Or thinking by our late dear brother’s death</li>
  <li class="number">Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,</li>
  <li>Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,</li>
  <li>He hath not fail’d to pester us with message,</li>
  <li>Importing the surrender of those lands</li>
  <li>Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,</li>
  <li class="number">To our most valiant brother. So much for him.</li>
  <li>Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:</li>
  <li>Thus much the business is: we have here writ</li>
  <li>To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras — </li>
  <li>Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears</li>
  <li class="number">Of this his nephew’s purpose — to suppress</li>
  <li>His further gait herein; in that the levies,</li>
  <li>The lists and full proportions, are all made</li>
  <li>Out of his subject: and we here dispatch</li>
  <li>You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,</li>
  <li class="number">For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;</li>
  <li>Giving to you no further personal power</li>
  <li>To business with the king, more than the scope</li>
  <li>Of these delated articles allow.</li>
  <li>Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CORNELIUS, VOLTIMAND">
  <li class="number">In that and all things will we show our duty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li>We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS</li>
  <li>And now, Laertes, what’s the news with you?</li>
  <li>You told us of some suit; what is’t, Laertes?</li>
  <li>You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,</li>
  <li class="number">And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,</li>
  <li>That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?</li>
  <li>The head is not more native to the heart,</li>
  <li>The hand more instrumental to the mouth,</li>
  <li>Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.</li>
  <li class="number">What wouldst thou have, Laertes?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAERTES">
  <li>My dread lord,</li>
  <li>Your leave and favour to return to France;</li>
  <li>From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,</li>
  <li>To show my duty in your coronation,</li>
  <li class="number">Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,</li>
  <li>My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France</li>
  <li>And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li>Have you your father’s leave? What says Polonius?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave</li>
  <li class="number">By laboursome petition, and at last</li>
  <li>Upon his will I seal’d my hard consent:</li>
  <li>I do beseech you, give him leave to go.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li>Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,</li>
  <li>And thy best graces spend it at thy will!</li>
  <li class="number">But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li><span class="stage-direction">Aside</span>  A little more than kin, and less than kind.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li>How is it that the clouds still hang on you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>Not so, my lord; I am too much i’ the sun.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN GERTRUDE">
  <li>Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,</li>
  <li class="number">And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.</li>
  <li>Do not for ever with thy vailed lids</li>
  <li>Seek for thy noble father in the dust:</li>
  <li>Thou know’st ’tis common; all that lives must die,</li>
  <li>Passing through nature to eternity.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li class="number">Ay, madam, it is common.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN GERTRUDE">
  <li>If it be,</li>
  <li>Why seems it so particular with thee?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not ’seems.’</li>
  <li>’Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor customary suits of solemn black,</li>
  <li>Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,</li>
  <li>No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,</li>
  <li>Nor the dejected ’havior of the visage,</li>
  <li>Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,</li>
  <li class="number">That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,</li>
  <li>For they are actions that a man might play:</li>
  <li>But I have that within which passeth show;</li>
  <li>These but the trappings and the suits of woe.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li>’Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,</li>
  <li class="number">To give these mourning duties to your father:</li>
  <li>But, you must know, your father lost a father;</li>
  <li>That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound</li>
  <li>In filial obligation for some term</li>
  <li>To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever</li>
  <li class="number">In obstinate condolement is a course</li>
  <li>Of impious stubbornness; ’tis unmanly grief;</li>
  <li>It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,</li>
  <li>A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,</li>
  <li>An understanding simple and unschool’d:</li>
  <li class="number">For what we know must be and is as common</li>
  <li>As any the most vulgar thing to sense,</li>
  <li>Why should we in our peevish opposition</li>
  <li>Take it to heart? Fie! ’tis a fault to heaven,</li>
  <li>A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,</li>
  <li class="number">To reason most absurd: whose common theme</li>
  <li>Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,</li>
  <li>From the first corse till he that died to-day,</li>
  <li>’This must be so.’ We pray you, throw to earth</li>
  <li>This unprevailing woe, and think of us</li>
  <li class="number">As of a father: for let the world take note,</li>
  <li>You are the most immediate to our throne;</li>
  <li>And with no less nobility of love</li>
  <li>Than that which dearest father bears his son,</li>
  <li>Do I impart toward you. For your intent</li>
  <li class="number">In going back to school in Wittenberg,</li>
  <li>It is most retrograde to our desire:</li>
  <li>And we beseech you, bend you to remain</li>
  <li>Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,</li>
  <li>Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN GERTRUDE">
  <li class="number">Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:</li>
  <li>I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>I shall in all my best obey you, madam.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li>Why, ’tis a loving and a fair reply:</li>
  <li>Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;</li>
  <li class="number">This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet</li>
  <li>Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,</li>
  <li>No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,</li>
  <li>But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,</li>
  <li>And the king’s rouse the heavens all bruit again,</li>

<ol data-speaker="HORATIO">
  <li>Two nights together had these gentlemen,</li>
  <li>Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,</li>
  <li>In the dead vast and middle of the night,</li>
  <li>Been thus encounter’d. A figure like your father,</li>
  <li class="number">Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,</li>
  <li>Appears before them, and with solemn march</li>
  <li>Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk’d</li>
  <li>By their oppress’d and fear-surprised eyes,</li>
  <li>Within his truncheon’s length; whilst they, distilled</li>
  <li class="number">Almost to jelly with the act of fear,</li>
  <li>Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me</li>

  <li>And I with them the third night kept the watch;</li>
  <li>Where, as they had deliver’d, both in time,</li>
  <li class="number">Form of the thing, each word made true and good,</li>
  <li>The apparition comes: I knew your father;</li>
  <li>These hands are not more like.</li>

  <li class="number">Did you not speak to it?</li>

  <li>My lord, I did;</li>
  <li>But answer made it none: yet once methought</li>
  <li>It lifted up its head and did address</li>
  <li>Itself to motion, like as it would speak;</li>
  <li class="number">But even then the morning cock crew loud,</li>
  <li>And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,</li>
  <li>And vanish’d from our sight.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>’Tis very strange.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORATIO">
  <li>As I do live, my honour’d lord, ’tis true;</li>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.</li>
  <li>Hold you the watch to-night?</li>

  <li>Then saw you not his face?</li>

<ol data-speaker="HORATIO">
  <li class="number">O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>What, look’d he frowningly?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORATIO">
  <li>A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.</li>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>Pale or red?</li>

<ol data-speaker="HORATIO">
  <li>Nay, very pale.</li>

<ol data-speaker="LAERTES">
  <li>My necessaries are embark’d: farewell:</li>
  <li>And, sister, as the winds give benefit</li>

  <li>But let me hear from you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OPHELIA">
  <li class="number">Do you doubt that?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAERTES">
  <li>For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,</li>

  <li>Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OPHELIA">
  <li>No more but so?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAERTES">
  <li>Think it no more;</li>
  <li>For nature, crescent, does not grow alone</li>
  <li>In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,</li>
  <li class="number">The inward service of the mind and soul</li>
  <li>Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,</li>
  <li>And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch</li>
  <li>The virtue of his will: but you must fear,</li>
  <li>His greatness weigh’d, his will is not his own;</li>
  <li class="number">For he himself is subject to his birth:</li>
  <li>He may not, as unvalued persons do,</li>
  <li>Carve for himself; for on his choice depends</li>
  <li>The safety and health of this whole state;</li>
  <li>And therefore must his choice be circumscribed</li>
  <li class="number">Unto the voice and yielding of that body</li>
  <li>Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,</li>
  <li>It fits your wisdom so far to believe it</li>
  <li>As he in his particular act and place</li>
  <li>May give his saying deed; which is no further</li>
  <li class="number">Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.</li>
  <li>Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,</li>
  <li>If with too credent ear you list his songs,</li>
  <li>Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open</li>
  <li>To his unmaster’d importunity.</li>
  <li class="number">Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,</li>
  <li>And keep you in the rear of your affection,</li>
  <li>Out of the shot and danger of desire.</li>
  <li>The chariest maid is prodigal enough,</li>
  <li>If she unmask her beauty to the moon:</li>
  <li class="number">Virtue itself ’scapes not calumnious strokes:</li>
  <li>The canker galls the infants of the spring,</li>

  <li>And in the morn and liquid dew of youth</li>
  <li>Contagious blastments are most imminent.</li>

  <li>Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.</li>
  <li class="number">Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,</li>

  <li>Of each new-hatch’d, unfledged comrade. Beware</li>
  <li>Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,</li>
  <li class="number">Bear’t that the opposed may beware of thee.</li>
  <li>Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;</li>
  <li>Take each man’s censure, but reserve thy judgment.</li>
  <li>Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,</li>
  <li>But not express’d in fancy; rich, not gaudy;</li>
  <li class="number">For the apparel oft proclaims the man,</li>
  <li>And they in France of the best rank and station</li>
  <li>Are of a most select and generous chief in that.</li>
  <li>Neither a borrower nor a lender be;</li>
  <li>For loan oft loses both itself and friend,</li>
  <li class="number">And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.</li>
  <li>This above all: to thine ownself be true,</li>

  <li class="number">Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Ghost beckons HAMLET</div>

  <li>It beckons you to go away with it,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCELLUS">
  <li>Look, with what courteous action</li>
  <li class="number">It waves you to a more removed ground:</li>

  <li>No, by no means.</li>

  <li>Do not, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li class="number">Why, what should be the fear?</li>
  <li>I do not set my life in a pin’s fee;</li>
  <li>And for my soul, what can it do to that,</li>

  <li>It waves me forth again: I’ll follow it.</li>

<ol data-speaker="HORATIO">
  <li class="number">What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,</li>

  <li>That beetles o’er his base into the sea,</li>
  <li>And there assume some other horrible form,</li>
  <li>Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason</li>
  <li class="number">And draw you into madness? think of it:</li>
  <li>The very place puts toys of desperation,</li>
  <li>Without more motive, into every brain</li>
  <li>That looks so many fathoms to the sea</li>
  <li>And hears it roar beneath.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>I will.</li>

<ol data-speaker="Ghost">
  <li>My hour is almost come,</li>
  <li class="number">When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames</li>
  <li>Must render up myself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>Alas, poor ghost!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Ghost">
  <li>Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing</li>
  <li>To what I shall unfold.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li class="number">Speak; I am bound to hear.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Ghost">
  <li>So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>What?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Ghost">
  <li>I am thy father’s spirit,</li>
  <li>Doom’d for a certain term to walk the night,</li>
  <li class="number">And for the day confined to fast in fires,</li>
  <li>Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature</li>
  <li>Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid</li>
  <li>To tell the secrets of my prison-house,</li>
  <li>I could a tale unfold whose lightest word</li>
  <li class="number">Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,</li>
  <li>Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,</li>
  <li>Thy knotted and combined locks to part</li>
  <li>And each particular hair to stand on end,</li>
  <li>Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:</li>
  <li class="number">But this eternal blazon must not be</li>
  <li>To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!</li>
  <li>If thou didst ever thy dear father love — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>O God!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Ghost">
  <li>Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li class="number">Murder!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Ghost">
  <li>Murder most foul, as in the best it is;</li>
  <li>But this most foul, strange and unnatural.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>Haste me to know’t, that I, with wings as swift</li>
  <li>As meditation or the thoughts of love,</li>
  <li class="number">May sweep to my revenge.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Ghost">
  <li>I find thee apt;</li>
  <li>And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed</li>
  <li>That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,</li>
  <li>Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:</li>
  <li class="number">’Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,</li>
  <li>A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark</li>
  <li>Is by a forged process of my death</li>
  <li>Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,</li>
  <li>The serpent that did sting thy father’s life</li>
  <li class="number">Now wears his crown.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>O my prophetic soul! My uncle!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Ghost">
  <li>Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,</li>
  <li>With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts — </li>
  <li>O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power</li>
  <li class="number">So to seduce! — won to his shameful lust</li>
  <li>The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:</li>
  <li>O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!</li>
  <li>From me, whose love was of that dignity</li>
  <li>That it went hand in hand even with the vow</li>
  <li class="number">I made to her in marriage, and to decline</li>
  <li>Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor</li>
  <li>To those of mine!</li>
  <li>But virtue, as it never will be moved,</li>
  <li>Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,</li>
  <li class="number">So lust, though to a radiant angel link’d,</li>
  <li>Will sate itself in a celestial bed,</li>
  <li>And prey on garbage.</li>
  <li>But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;</li>
  <li>Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,</li>
  <li class="number">My custom always of the afternoon,</li>
  <li>Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,</li>
  <li>With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,</li>
  <li>And in the porches of my ears did pour</li>
  <li>The leperous distilment; whose effect</li>
  <li class="number">Holds such an enmity with blood of man</li>
  <li>That swift as quicksilver it courses through</li>
  <li>The natural gates and alleys of the body,</li>
  <li>And with a sudden vigour doth posset</li>
  <li>And curd, like eager droppings into milk,</li>
  <li class="number">The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;</li>
  <li>And a most instant tetter bark’d about,</li>
  <li>Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,</li>
  <li>All my smooth body.</li>
  <li>Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother’s hand</li>
  <li class="number">Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch’d:</li>
  <li>Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,</li>
  <li>Unhousel’d, disappointed, unanel’d,</li>
  <li>No reckoning made, but sent to my account</li>
  <li>With all my imperfections on my head:</li>
  <li class="number">O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!</li>
  <li>If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;</li>
  <li>Let not the royal bed of Denmark be</li>
  <li>A couch for luxury and damned incest.</li>
  <li>But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,</li>
  <li class="number">Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive</li>
  <li>Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven</li>
  <li>And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,</li>
  <li>To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!</li>
  <li>The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,</li>
  <li class="number">And ’gins to pale his uneffectual fire:</li>
  <li>Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.</li>

  <li>Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.</li>

  <li>I will, my lord.</li>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="REYNALDO">
  <li>My lord, I did intend it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,</li>
  <li>Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;</li>
  <li>And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,</li>
  <li class="number">What company, at what expense; and finding</li>
  <li>By this encompassment and drift of question</li>
  <li>That they do know my son, come you more nearer</li>
  <li>Than your particular demands will touch it:</li>
  <li>Take you, as ’twere, some distant knowledge of him;</li>
  <li class="number">As thus, ’I know his father and his friends,</li>
  <li>And in part him: ’ do you mark this, Reynaldo?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="REYNALDO">
  <li>Ay, very well, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>’And in part him; but’ you may say ’not well:</li>
  <li>But, if’t be he I mean, he’s very wild;</li>
  <li class="number">Addicted so and so:’ and there put on him</li>
  <li>What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank</li>
  <li>As may dishonour him; take heed of that;</li>
  <li>But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips</li>
  <li>As are companions noted and most known</li>
  <li class="number">To youth and liberty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="REYNALDO">
  <li>As gaming, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,</li>
  <li>Drabbing: you may go so far.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="REYNALDO">
  <li>My lord, that would dishonour him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li class="number">’Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge</li>
  <li>You must not put another scandal on him,</li>
  <li>That he is open to incontinency;</li>
  <li>That’s not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly</li>
  <li>That they may seem the taints of liberty,</li>
  <li class="number">The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,</li>
  <li>A savageness in unreclaimed blood,</li>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>Wherefore should you do this?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="REYNALDO">
  <li class="number">Ay, my lord,</li>
  <li>I would know that.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>Marry, sir, here’s my drift;</li>
  <li>And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:</li>
  <li>You laying these slight sullies on my son,</li>
  <li class="number">As ’twere a thing a little soil’d i’ the working, Mark you,</li>
  <li>Your party in converse, him you would sound,</li>
  <li>Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes</li>
  <li>The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured</li>
  <li>He closes with you in this consequence;</li>
  <li class="number">’Good sir,’ or so, or ’friend,’ or ’gentleman,’</li>
  <li>According to the phrase or the addition</li>
  <li>Of man and country.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="REYNALDO">
  <li>Very good, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>And then, sir, does he this — he does — what was I</li>
  <li class="number">about to say? By the mass, I was about to say</li>
  <li>something: where did I leave?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="REYNALDO">
  <li>At ’closes in the consequence,’ at ’friend or so,’</li>
  <li>and ’gentleman.’</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>At ’closes in the consequence,’ ay, marry;</li>
  <li class="number">He closes thus: ’I know the gentleman;</li>
  <li>I saw him yesterday, or t’ other day,</li>
  <li>Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,</li>
  <li>There was a’ gaming; there o’ertook in’s rouse;</li>
  <li>There falling out at tennis:’ or perchance,</li>
  <li class="number">’I saw him enter such a house of sale,’</li>
  <li>Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.</li>
  <li>See you now;</li>
  <li>Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:</li>
  <li>And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,</li>
  <li class="number">With windlasses and with assays of bias,</li>
  <li>By indirections find directions out:</li>
  <li>So by my former lecture and advice,</li>
  <li>Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="REYNALDO">
  <li>My lord, I have.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li class="number">God be wi’ you; fare you well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="REYNALDO">
  <li>Good my lord!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>Observe his inclination in yourself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="REYNALDO">
  <li>I shall, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>And let him ply his music.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="REYNALDO">

  <li>Farewell!</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exit REYNALDO</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter OPHELIA</li>
  <li>How now, Ophelia! what’s the matter?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OPHELIA">
  <li>O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>With what, i’ the name of God?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OPHELIA">
  <li class="number">My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,</li>
  <li>Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;</li>
  <li>No hat upon his head; his stockings foul’d,</li>
  <li>Ungarter’d, and down-gyved to his ancle;</li>
  <li>Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;</li>
  <li class="number">And with a look so piteous in purport</li>
  <li>As if he had been loosed out of hell</li>
  <li>To speak of horrors — he comes before me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>Mad for thy love?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OPHELIA">
  <li>My lord, I do not know;</li>
  <li class="number">But truly, I do fear it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>What said he?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OPHELIA">
  <li>He took me by the wrist and held me hard;</li>
  <li>Then goes he to the length of all his arm;</li>
  <li>And, with his other hand thus o’er his brow,</li>
  <li class="number">He falls to such perusal of my face</li>
  <li>As he would draw it. Long stay’d he so;</li>
  <li>At last, a little shaking of mine arm</li>
  <li>And thrice his head thus waving up and down,</li>
  <li>He raised a sigh so piteous and profound</li>
  <li class="number">As it did seem to shatter all his bulk</li>
  <li>And end his being: that done, he lets me go:</li>
  <li>And, with his head over his shoulder turn’d,</li>
  <li>He seem’d to find his way without his eyes;</li>
  <li>For out o’ doors he went without their helps,</li>
  <li class="number">And, to the last, bended their light on me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.</li>
  <li>This is the very ecstasy of love,</li>
  <li>Whose violent property fordoes itself</li>
  <li>And leads the will to desperate undertakings</li>
  <li class="number">As oft as any passion under heaven</li>
  <li>That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.</li>
  <li>What, have you given him any hard words of late?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OPHELIA">
  <li>No, my good lord, but, as you did command,</li>
  <li>I did repel his fetters and denied</li>
  <li class="number">His access to me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>That hath made him mad.</li>
  <li>I am sorry that with better heed and judgment</li>
  <li>I had not quoted him: I fear’d he did but trifle,</li>
  <li>And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!</li>
  <li class="number">By heaven, it is as proper to our age</li>
  <li>To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions</li>
  <li>As it is common for the younger sort</li>
  <li>To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:</li>
  <li>This must be known; which, being kept close, might</li>
  <li class="number">move</li>
  <li>More grief to hide than hate to utter love.</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li>Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!</li>
  <li>Moreover that we much did long to see you,</li>
  <li>The need we have to use you did provoke</li>
  <li>Our hasty sending. Something have you heard</li>
  <li class="number">Of Hamlet’s transformation; so call it,</li>
  <li>Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man</li>
  <li>Resembles that it was. What it should be,</li>
  <li>More than his father’s death, that thus hath put him</li>
  <li>So much from the understanding of himself,</li>
  <li class="number">I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,</li>
  <li>That, being of so young days brought up with him,</li>
  <li>And sith so neighbour’d to his youth and havior,</li>
  <li>That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court</li>
  <li>Some little time: so by your companies</li>
  <li class="number">To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,</li>
  <li>So much as from occasion you may glean,</li>
  <li>Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,</li>
  <li>That, open’d, lies within our remedy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN GERTRUDE">
  <li>Good gentlemen, he hath much talk’d of you;</li>
  <li class="number">And sure I am two men there are not living</li>
  <li>To whom he more adheres. If it will please you</li>
  <li>To show us so much gentry and good will</li>
  <li>As to expend your time with us awhile,</li>
  <li>For the supply and profit of our hope,</li>
  <li class="number">Your visitation shall receive such thanks</li>
  <li>As fits a king’s remembrance.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSENCRANTZ">
  <li>Both your majesties</li>
  <li>Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,</li>
  <li>Put your dread pleasures more into command</li>
  <li class="number">Than to entreaty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GUILDENSTERN">
  <li>But we both obey,</li>
  <li>And here give up ourselves, in the full bent</li>
  <li>To lay our service freely at your feet,</li>
  <li>To be commanded.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li class="number">Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN GERTRUDE">
  <li>Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:</li>
  <li>And I beseech you instantly to visit</li>
  <li>My too much changed son. Go, some of you,</li>
  <li>And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.</li>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,</li>
  <li>Are joyfully return’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li class="number">Thou still hast been the father of good news.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,</li>
  <li>I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,</li>
  <li>Both to my God and to my gracious king:</li>
  <li>And I do think, or else this brain of mine</li>
  <li class="number">Hunts not the trail of policy so sure</li>
  <li>As it hath used to do, that I have found</li>
  <li>The very cause of Hamlet’s lunacy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li>O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>Give first admittance to the ambassadors;</li>
  <li class="number">My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li>Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exit POLONIUS</li>
  <li>He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found</li>
  <li>The head and source of all your son’s distemper.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN GERTRUDE">
  <li>I doubt it is no other but the main;</li>
  <li class="number">His father’s death, and our o’erhasty marriage.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li>Well, we shall sift him.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Re-enter POLONIUS, with VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS</li>
  <li>Welcome, my good friends!</li>
  <li>Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VOLTIMAND">
  <li>Most fair return of greetings and desires.</li>
  <li class="number">Upon our first, he sent out to suppress</li>
  <li>His nephew’s levies; which to him appear’d</li>
  <li>To be a preparation ’gainst the Polack;</li>
  <li>But, better look’d into, he truly found</li>
  <li>It was against your highness: whereat grieved,</li>
  <li class="number">That so his sickness, age and impotence</li>
  <li>Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests</li>
  <li>On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;</li>
  <li>Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine</li>
  <li>Makes vow before his uncle never more</li>
  <li class="number">To give the assay of arms against your majesty.</li>
  <li>Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,</li>
  <li>Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,</li>
  <li>And his commission to employ those soldiers,</li>
  <li>So levied as before, against the Polack:</li>
  <li class="number">With an entreaty, herein further shown,</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Giving a paper</li>
  <li>That it might please you to give quiet pass</li>
  <li>Through your dominions for this enterprise,</li>
  <li>On such regards of safety and allowance</li>
  <li>As therein are set down.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li class="number">It likes us well;</li>
  <li>And at our more consider’d time well read,</li>
  <li>Answer, and think upon this business.</li>
  <li>Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:</li>
  <li>Go to your rest; at night we’ll feast together:</li>
  <li class="number">Most welcome home!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS</div>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>This business is well ended.</li>
  <li>My liege, and madam, to expostulate</li>
  <li>What majesty should be, what duty is,</li>
  <li>Why day is day, night night, and time is time,</li>
  <li class="number">Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.</li>
  <li>Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,</li>
  <li>And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,</li>
  <li>I will be brief: your noble son is mad:</li>
  <li>Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,</li>
  <li class="number">What is’t but to be nothing else but mad?</li>
  <li>But let that go.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN GERTRUDE">
  <li>More matter, with less art.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>Madam, I swear I use no art at all.</li>
  <li>That he is mad, ’tis true: ’tis true ’tis pity;</li>
  <li class="number">And pity ’tis ’tis true: a foolish figure;</li>
  <li>But farewell it, for I will use no art.</li>
  <li>Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains</li>
  <li>That we find out the cause of this effect,</li>
  <li>Or rather say, the cause of this defect,</li>
  <li class="number">For this effect defective comes by cause:</li>
  <li>Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend.</li>
  <li>I have a daughter — have while she is mine — </li>
  <li>Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,</li>
  <li>Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Reads</li>
  <li class="number">’To the celestial and my soul’s idol, the most</li>
  <li>beautified Ophelia,’ — </li>
  <li>That’s an ill phrase, a vile phrase; ’beautified’ is</li>
  <li>a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Reads</li>
  <li>’In her excellent white bosom, these, &amp;c.’</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN GERTRUDE">
  <li class="number">Came this from Hamlet to her?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Reads</li>
  <li>’Doubt thou the stars are fire;</li>
  <li>Doubt that the sun doth move;</li>
  <li>Doubt truth to be a liar;</li>
  <li class="number">But never doubt I love.</li>
  <li>’O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;</li>
  <li>I have not art to reckon my groans: but that</li>
  <li>I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.</li>
  <li>’Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst</li>
  <li class="number">this machine is to him, HAMLET.’</li>
  <li>This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,</li>
  <li>And more above, hath his solicitings,</li>
  <li>As they fell out by time, by means and place,</li>
  <li>All given to mine ear.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li class="number">But how hath she</li>
  <li>Received his love?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>What do you think of me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li>As of a man faithful and honourable.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>I would fain prove so. But what might you think,</li>
  <li class="number">When I had seen this hot love on the wing — </li>
  <li>As I perceived it, I must tell you that,</li>
  <li>Before my daughter told me — what might you,</li>
  <li>Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,</li>
  <li>If I had play’d the desk or table-book,</li>
  <li class="number">Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,</li>
  <li>Or look’d upon this love with idle sight;</li>
  <li>What might you think? No, I went round to work,</li>
  <li>And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:</li>
  <li>’Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;</li>
  <li class="number">This must not be:’ and then I precepts gave her,</li>
  <li>That she should lock herself from his resort,</li>
  <li>Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.</li>
  <li>Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;</li>
  <li>And he, repulsed — a short tale to make — </li>
  <li class="number">Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,</li>
  <li>Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,</li>
  <li>Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,</li>
  <li>Into the madness wherein now he raves,</li>
  <li>And all we mourn for.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li class="number">Do you think ’tis this?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN GERTRUDE">
  <li>It may be, very likely.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>Hath there been such a time — I’d fain know that — </li>
  <li>That I have positively said ’Tis so,’</li>
  <li>When it proved otherwise?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li class="number">Not that I know.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li><stagedir>Pointing to his head and shoulder</stagedir></li>
  <li>Take this from this, if this be otherwise:</li>
  <li>If circumstances lead me, I will find</li>
  <li>Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed</li>
  <li class="number">Within the centre.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li>How may we try it further?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>You know, sometimes he walks four hours together</li>
  <li>Here in the lobby.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN GERTRUDE">
  <li>So he does indeed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li class="number">At such a time I’ll loose my daughter to him:</li>
  <li>Be you and I behind an arras then;</li>
  <li>Mark the encounter: if he love her not</li>
  <li>And be not from his reason fall’n thereon,</li>
  <li>Let me be no assistant for a state,</li>
  <li class="number">But keep a farm and carters.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li>We will try it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN GERTRUDE">
  <li>But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>Away, I do beseech you, both away:</li>
  <li>I’ll board him presently.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, and
Attendants</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter HAMLET, reading</li>
  <li class="number">O, give me leave:</li>
  <li>How does my good Lord Hamlet?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>Well, God-a-mercy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>Do you know me, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li class="number">Not I, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>Then I would you were so honest a man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>Honest, my lord!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be</li>
  <li>one man picked out of ten thousand.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li class="number">That’s very true, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a</li>
  <li>god kissing carrion — Have you a daughter?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>I have, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>Let her not walk i’ the sun: conception is a</li>

  <li>Friend, look to ’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li><span class="stage-direction">Aside</span>  How say you by that? Still harping on my</li>
  <li>daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I</li>
  <li>was a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and</li>
  <li class="number">truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for</li>
  <li>love; very near this. I’ll speak to him again.</li>
  <li>What do you read, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>Words, words, words.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>What is the matter, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li class="number">Between who?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here</li>
  <li>that old men have grey beards, that their faces are</li>
  <li>wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and</li>
  <li class="number">plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of</li>
  <li>wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,</li>
  <li>though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet</li>
  <li>I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for</li>
  <li>yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab</li>
  <li class="number">you could go backward.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li><span class="stage-direction">Aside</span>  Though this be madness, yet there is method</li>
  <li>in ’t. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>Into my grave.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>Indeed, that is out o’ the air.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Aside</li>
  <li class="number">How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness</li>
  <li>that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity</li>
  <li>could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will</li>
  <li>leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of</li>
  <li>meeting between him and my daughter. — My honourable</li>
  <li class="number">lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will</li>

<ol data-speaker="ROSENCRANTZ">
  <li>We think not so, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>Why, then, ’tis none to you; for there is nothing</li>
  <li>either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me</li>
  <li class="number">it is a prison.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSENCRANTZ">
  <li>Why then, your ambition makes it one; ’tis too</li>
  <li>narrow for your mind.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count</li>
  <li>myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I</li>
  <li class="number">have bad dreams.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GUILDENSTERN">
  <li>Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and</li>
  <li>outstretched heroes the beggars’ shadows. Shall we</li>
  <li>to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN">
  <li>We’ll wait upon you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li class="number">No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest</li>
  <li>of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest</li>
  <li>man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the</li>
  <li>beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSENCRANTZ">
  <li>To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li class="number">Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I</li>
  <li>thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are</li>
  <li>too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it</li>
  <li>your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,</li>
  <li>deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GUILDENSTERN">
  <li class="number">What should we say, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent</li>
  <li>for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks</li>
  <li>which your modesties have not craft enough to colour:</li>
  <li>I know the good king and queen have sent for you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSENCRANTZ">
  <li class="number">To what end, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by</li>
  <li>the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of</li>
  <li>our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved</li>
  <li>love, and by what more dear a better proposer could</li>
  <li class="number">charge you withal, be even and direct with me,</li>
  <li>whether you were sent for, or no?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSENCRANTZ">
  <li><stagedir>Aside to GUILDENSTERN</stagedir>  What say you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li><span class="stage-direction">Aside</span>  Nay, then, I have an eye of you. — If you</li>
  <li>love me, hold not off.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GUILDENSTERN">
  <li class="number">My lord, we were sent for.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation</li>
  <li>prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king</li>
  <li>and queen moult no feather. I have of late — but</li>
  <li>wherefore I know not — lost all my mirth, forgone all</li>
  <li class="number">custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily</li>
  <li>with my disposition that this goodly frame, the</li>
  <li>earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most</li>
  <li>excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave</li>
  <li>o’erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted</li>
  <li class="number">with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to</li>
  <li>me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.</li>
  <li>What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!</li>
  <li>how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how</li>
  <li>express and admirable! in action how like an angel!</li>
  <li class="number">in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the</li>
  <li>world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,</li>
  <li>what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not</li>
  <li>me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling</li>
  <li>you seem to say so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSENCRANTZ">
  <li class="number">My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>Why did you laugh then, when I said ’man delights not me’?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSENCRANTZ">
  <li>To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what</li>
  <li>lenten entertainment the players shall receive from</li>
  <li>you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they</li>
  <li class="number">coming, to offer you service.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty</li>
  <li>shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight</li>
  <li>shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not</li>
  <li>sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part</li>
  <li class="number">in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose</li>
  <li>lungs are tickled o’ the sere; and the lady shall</li>
  <li>say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt</li>
  <li>for’t. What players are they?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSENCRANTZ">
  <li>Even those you were wont to take delight in, the</li>
  <li class="number">tragedians of the city.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>How chances it they travel? their residence, both</li>
  <li>in reputation and profit, was better both ways.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSENCRANTZ">
  <li>I think their inhibition comes by the means of the</li>
  <li>late innovation.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li class="number">Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was</li>
  <li>in the city? are they so followed?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSENCRANTZ">
  <li>No, indeed, are they not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>How comes it? do they grow rusty?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSENCRANTZ">
  <li>Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but</li>
  <li class="number">there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,</li>
  <li>that cry out on the top of question, and are most</li>
  <li>tyrannically clapped for’t: these are now the</li>
  <li>fashion, and so berattle the common stages — so they</li>
  <li>call them — that many wearing rapiers are afraid of</li>
  <li class="number">goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>What, are they children? who maintains ’em? how are</li>
  <li>they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no</li>
  <li>longer than they can sing? will they not say</li>
  <li>afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common</li>
  <li class="number">players — as it is most like, if their means are no</li>
  <li>better — their writers do them wrong, to make them</li>
  <li>exclaim against their own succession?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSENCRANTZ">
  <li>’Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and</li>
  <li>the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to</li>
  <li class="number">controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid</li>
  <li>for argument, unless the poet and the player went to</li>
  <li>cuffs in the question.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>Is’t possible?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GUILDENSTERN">
  <li>O, there has been much throwing about of brains.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li class="number">Do the boys carry it away?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSENCRANTZ">
  <li>Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of</li>
  <li>Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while</li>
  <li>my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an</li>
  <li class="number">hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.</li>
  <li>’Sblood, there is something in this more than</li>
  <li>natural, if philosophy could find it out.</li>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands,</li>
  <li class="number">come then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion</li>
  <li>and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb,</li>
  <li>lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you,</li>
  <li>must show fairly outward, should more appear like</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GUILDENSTERN">
  <li>In what, my dear lord?</li>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>My lord, I have news to tell you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>My lord, I have news to tell you.</li>
  <li class="number">When Roscius was an actor in Rome — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>The actors are come hither, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>Buz, buz!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>Upon mine honour — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>Then came each actor on his ass — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li class="number">The best actors in the world, either for tragedy,</li>
  <li>comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,</li>
  <li>historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-</li>
  <li>comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>Nay, that follows not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>What follows, then, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>Why,</li>
  <li>’As by lot, God wot,’</li>
  <li class="number">and then, you know,</li>
  <li>’It came to pass, as most like it was,’ — </li>
  <li>the first row of the pious chanson will show you</li>
  <li>more; for look, where my abridgement comes.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter four or five Players</li>
  <li>You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am glad</li>
  <li class="number">to see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old</li>
  <li>friend! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last:</li>
  <li>comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young</li>
  <li>lady and mistress! By’r lady, your ladyship is</li>
  <li>nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the</li>
  <li class="number">altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like</li>
  <li>apiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the</li>
  <li>ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We’ll e’en</li>
  <li>to’t like French falconers, fly at any thing we see:</li>
  <li>we’ll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste</li>
  <li class="number">of your quality; come, a passionate speech.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Player">
  <li>What speech, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was</li>
  <li>never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the</li>
  <li>play, I remember, pleased not the million; ’twas</li>
  <li class="number">caviare to the general: but it was — as I received</li>
  <li>it, and others, whose judgments in such matters</li>
  <li>cried in the top of mine — an excellent play, well</li>
  <li>digested in the scenes, set down with as much</li>
  <li>modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there</li>
  <li class="number">were no sallets in the lines to make the matter</li>
  <li>savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might</li>
  <li>indict the author of affectation; but called it an</li>
  <li>honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very</li>
  <li>much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I</li>
  <li class="number">chiefly loved: ’twas Aeneas’ tale to Dido; and</li>
  <li>thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of</li>
  <li>Priam’s slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin</li>
  <li>at this line: let me see, let me see — </li>
  <li>’The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,’ — </li>
  <li class="number">it is not so: — it begins with Pyrrhus: — </li>
  <li>’The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,</li>
  <li>Black as his purpose, did the night resemble</li>
  <li>When he lay couched in the ominous horse,</li>
  <li>Hath now this dread and black complexion smear’d</li>
  <li class="number">With heraldry more dismal; head to foot</li>
  <li>Now is he total gules; horridly trick’d</li>
  <li>With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,</li>
  <li>Baked and impasted with the parching streets,</li>
  <li>That lend a tyrannous and damned light</li>
  <li class="number">To their lord’s murder: roasted in wrath and fire,</li>
  <li>And thus o’er-sized with coagulate gore,</li>
  <li>With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus</li>
  <li>Old grandsire Priam seeks.’</li>
  <li>So, proceed you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li class="number">’Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and</li>
  <li>good discretion.</li>

<ol data-speaker="First Player">
  <li>’Anon he finds him</li>
  <li>Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,</li>
  <li>Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,</li>
  <li class="number">Repugnant to command: unequal match’d,</li>
  <li>Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;</li>
  <li>But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword</li>
  <li>The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,</li>
  <li>Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top</li>
  <li class="number">Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash</li>
  <li>Takes prisoner Pyrrhus’ ear: for, lo! his sword,</li>
  <li>Which was declining on the milky head</li>
  <li>Of reverend Priam, seem’d i’ the air to stick:</li>
  <li>So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,</li>
  <li class="number">And like a neutral to his will and matter,</li>
  <li>Did nothing.</li>
  <li>But, as we often see, against some storm,</li>
  <li>A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,</li>
  <li>The bold winds speechless and the orb below</li>
  <li class="number">As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder</li>
  <li>Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus’ pause,</li>
  <li>Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;</li>
  <li>And never did the Cyclops’ hammers fall</li>
  <li>On Mars’s armour forged for proof eterne</li>
  <li class="number">With less remorse than Pyrrhus’ bleeding sword</li>
  <li>Now falls on Priam.</li>
  <li>Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,</li>
  <li>In general synod ’take away her power;</li>
  <li>Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,</li>

  <li>Now I am alone.</li>
  <li>O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!</li>
  <li class="number">Is it not monstrous that this player here,</li>
  <li>But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,</li>
  <li>Could force his soul so to his own conceit</li>
  <li>That from her working all his visage wann’d,</li>
  <li>Tears in his eyes, distraction in’s aspect,</li>
  <li class="number">A broken voice, and his whole function suiting</li>

  <li class="number">The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,</li>

  <li>O, vengeance!</li>

<h3>SCENE I.  A room in the castle.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS,
OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN</div>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li>And can you, by no drift of circumstance,</li>
  <li>Get from him why he puts on this confusion,</li>
  <li>Grating so harshly all his days of quiet</li>
  <li>With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSENCRANTZ">
  <li class="number">He does confess he feels himself distracted;</li>
  <li>But from what cause he will by no means speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GUILDENSTERN">
  <li>Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,</li>
  <li>But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,</li>
  <li>When we would bring him on to some confession</li>
  <li class="number">Of his true state.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN GERTRUDE">
  <li>Did he receive you well?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSENCRANTZ">
  <li>Most like a gentleman.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GUILDENSTERN">
  <li>But with much forcing of his disposition.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSENCRANTZ">
  <li>Niggard of question; but, of our demands,</li>
  <li class="number">Most free in his reply.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN GERTRUDE">
  <li>Did you assay him?</li>
  <li>To any pastime?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSENCRANTZ">
  <li>Madam, it so fell out, that certain players</li>
  <li>We o’er-raught on the way: of these we told him;</li>
  <li class="number">And there did seem in him a kind of joy</li>
  <li>To hear of it: they are about the court,</li>
  <li>And, as I think, they have already order</li>
  <li>This night to play before him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>’Tis most true:</li>
  <li class="number">And he beseech’d me to entreat your majesties</li>
  <li>To hear and see the matter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li>With all my heart; and it doth much content me</li>
  <li>To hear him so inclined.</li>
  <li>Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,</li>
  <li class="number">And drive his purpose on to these delights.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSENCRANTZ">
  <li>We shall, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN</div>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li>Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;</li>
  <li>For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,</li>
  <li>That he, as ’twere by accident, may here</li>
  <li class="number">Affront Ophelia:</li>
  <li>Her father and myself, lawful espials,</li>
  <li>Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,</li>
  <li>We may of their encounter frankly judge,</li>
  <li>And gather by him, as he is behaved,</li>
  <li class="number">If ’t be the affliction of his love or no</li>
  <li>That thus he suffers for.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN GERTRUDE">
  <li>I shall obey you.</li>
  <li>And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish</li>
  <li>That your good beauties be the happy cause</li>
  <li class="number">Of Hamlet’s wildness: so shall I hope your virtues</li>
  <li>Will bring him to his wonted way again,</li>
  <li>To both your honours.</li>

  <li>Madam, I wish it may.</li>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you,</li>
  <li class="number">We will bestow ourselves.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">To OPHELIA</li>
  <li>Read on this book;</li>
  <li>That show of such an exercise may colour</li>
  <li>Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in this — </li>
  <li>’Tis too much proved — that with devotion’s visage</li>
  <li class="number">And pious action we do sugar o’er</li>
  <li>The devil himself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li><span class="stage-direction">Aside</span>          O, ’tis too true!</li>
  <li>How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!</li>
  <li>The harlot’s cheek, beautied with plastering art,</li>
  <li class="number">Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it</li>
  <li>Than is my deed to my most painted word:</li>
  <li>O heavy burthen!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD POLONIUS">
  <li>I hear him coming: let’s withdraw, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS</div>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter HAMLET</div>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>To be, or not to be: that is the question:</li>
  <li class="number">Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer</li>
  <li>The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,</li>
  <li>Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,</li>
  <li>And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;</li>
  <li>No more; and by a sleep to say we end</li>
  <li class="number">The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks</li>
  <li>That flesh is heir to, ’tis a consummation</li>
  <li>Devoutly to be wish’d. To die, to sleep;</li>
  <li>To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there’s the rub;</li>
  <li>For in that sleep of death what dreams may come</li>
  <li class="number">When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,</li>
  <li>Must give us pause: there’s the respect</li>
  <li>That makes calamity of so long life;</li>
  <li>For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,</li>
  <li>The oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely,</li>
  <li class="number">The pangs of despised love, the law’s delay,</li>
  <li>The insolence of office and the spurns</li>
  <li>That patient merit of the unworthy takes,</li>
  <li>When he himself might his quietus make</li>
  <li>With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,</li>
  <li class="number">To grunt and sweat under a weary life,</li>
  <li>But that the dread of something after death,</li>
  <li>The undiscover’d country from whose bourn</li>
  <li>No traveller returns, puzzles the will</li>
  <li>And makes us rather bear those ills we have</li>
  <li class="number">Than fly to others that we know not of?</li>
  <li>Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;</li>
  <li>And thus the native hue of resolution</li>
  <li>Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought,</li>
  <li>And enterprises of great pith and moment</li>
  <li class="number">With this regard their currents turn awry,</li>
  <li>And lose the name of action. — Soft you now!</li>
  <li>The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons</li>
  <li>Be all my sins remember’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OPHELIA">
  <li>Good my lord,</li>
  <li class="number">How does your honour for this many a day?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>I humbly thank you; well, well, well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OPHELIA">
  <li>My lord, I have remembrances of yours,</li>
  <li>That I have longed long to re-deliver;</li>
  <li>I pray you, now receive them.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li class="number">No, not I;</li>
  <li>I never gave you aught.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OPHELIA">
  <li>My honour’d lord, you know right well you did;</li>
  <li>And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed</li>
  <li>As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,</li>
  <li class="number">Take these again; for to the noble mind</li>
  <li>Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.</li>
  <li>There, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>Ha, ha! are you honest?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OPHELIA">
  <li>My lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li class="number">Are you fair?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OPHELIA">
  <li>What means your lordship?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should</li>
  <li>admit no discourse to your beauty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OPHELIA">
  <li>Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than</li>
  <li class="number">with honesty?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner</li>
  <li>transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the</li>
  <li>force of honesty can translate beauty into his</li>
  <li>likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the</li>
  <li class="number">time gives it proof. I did love you once.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OPHELIA">
  <li>Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot</li>
  <li>so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of</li>
  <li>it: I loved you not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OPHELIA">
  <li class="number">I was the more deceived.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a</li>
  <li>breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest;</li>
  <li>but yet I could accuse me of such things that it</li>
  <li>were better my mother had not borne me: I am very</li>
  <li class="number">proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at</li>
  <li>my beck than I have thoughts to put them in,</li>
  <li>imagination to give them shape, or time to act them</li>
  <li>in. What should such fellows as I do crawling</li>
  <li>between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves,</li>
  <li class="number">all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.</li>
  <li>Where’s your father?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OPHELIA">
  <li>At home, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the</li>
  <li>fool no where but in’s own house. Farewell.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OPHELIA">
  <li class="number">O, help him, you sweet heavens!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>If thou dost marry, I’ll give thee this plague for</li>
  <li>thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as</li>
  <li>snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a</li>
  <li>nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs</li>
  <li class="number">marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough</li>
  <li>what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go,</li>
  <li>and quickly too. Farewell.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OPHELIA">
  <li>O heavenly powers, restore him!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God</li>
  <li class="number">has given you one face, and you make yourselves</li>
  <li>another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and</li>
  <li>nick-name God’s creatures, and make your wantonness</li>
  <li>your ignorance. Go to, I’ll no more on’t; it hath</li>
  <li>made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages:</li>
  <li class="number">those that are married already, all but one, shall</li>
  <li>live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a</li>
  <li>nunnery, go.</li>

  <li>The courtier’s, soldier’s, scholar’s, eye, tongue, sword;</li>
  <li class="number">The expectancy and rose of the fair state,</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  A hall in the castle.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter HAMLET and Players</div>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to</li>
  <li>you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it,</li>
  <li>as many of your players do, I had as lief the</li>
  <li>town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air</li>
  <li class="number">too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;</li>
  <li>for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,</li>
  <li>the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget</li>
  <li>a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it</li>
  <li>offends me to the soul to hear a robustious</li>
  <li class="number">periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to</li>
  <li>very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who</li>
  <li>for the most part are capable of nothing but</li>
  <li>inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have such</li>
  <li>a fellow whipped for o’erdoing Termagant; it</li>
  <li class="number">out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Player">
  <li>I warrant your honour.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion</li>
  <li>be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the</li>
  <li>word to the action; with this special o’erstep not</li>
  <li class="number">the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is</li>
  <li>from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the</li>
  <li>first and now, was and is, to hold, as ’twere, the</li>
  <li>mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,</li>
  <li>scorn her own image, and the very age and body of</li>
  <li class="number">the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,</li>
  <li>or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful</li>
  <li>laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the</li>
  <li>censure of the which one must in your allowance</li>
  <li>o’erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be</li>
  <li class="number">players that I have seen play, and heard others</li>
  <li>praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,</li>
  <li>that, neither having the accent of Christians nor</li>
  <li>the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so</li>
  <li>strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of</li>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>O, reform it altogether. And let those that play</li>

  <li>for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to</li>
  <li>set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh</li>
  <li>too; though, in the mean time, some necessary</li>
  <li>question of the play be then to be considered:</li>
  <li class="number">that’s villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition</li>

  <li>No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,</li>

  <li>Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice</li>
  <li class="number">And could of men distinguish, her election</li>

  <li class="number">Even with the very comment of thy soul</li>
  <li>Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt</li>

  <li>It is a damned ghost that we have seen,</li>
  <li>And my imaginations are as foul</li>
  <li class="number">As Vulcan’s stithy. Give him heedful note;</li>

embracing him, and he her. She kneels, and makes
show of protestation unto him. He takes her up,

upon a bank of flowers: she, seeing him asleep,
leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King’s
ears, and exit. The Queen returns; finds the King
dead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner,
with some two or three Mutes, comes in again,
seeming to lament with her. The dead body is
carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with
gifts: she seems loath and unwilling awhile, but

  <li>So far from cheer and from your former state,</li>
  <li class="number">That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,</li>
  <li>Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:</li>
  <li>For women’s fear and love holds quantity;</li>
  <li>In neither aught, or in extremity.</li>
  <li>Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;</li>
  <li class="number">And as my love is sized, my fear is so:</li>

  <li>I do believe you think what now you speak;</li>

  <li>Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;</li>
  <li>But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be.</li>
  <li>Most necessary ’tis that we forget</li>
  <li>To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:</li>
  <li class="number">What to ourselves in passion we propose,</li>
  <li>The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.</li>
  <li>The violence of either grief or joy</li>
  <li>Their own enactures with themselves destroy:</li>

  <li class="number">Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.</li>
  <li>This world is not for aye, nor ’tis not strange</li>

  <li>Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.</li>
  <li class="number">The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;</li>

  <li>But, orderly to end where I begun,</li>
  <li>Our wills and fates do so contrary run</li>

  <li>Though inclination be as sharp as will:</li>
  <li>My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;</li>
  <li>And, like a man to double business bound,</li>
  <li class="number">I stand in pause where I shall first begin,</li>
  <li>And both neglect. What if this cursed hand</li>
  <li>Were thicker than itself with brother’s blood,</li>
  <li>Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens</li>
  <li>To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy</li>
  <li class="number">But to confront the visage of offence?</li>
  <li>And what’s in prayer but this two-fold force,</li>
  <li>To be forestalled ere we come to fall,</li>
  <li>Or pardon’d being down? Then I’ll look up;</li>
  <li>My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer</li>
  <li class="number">Can serve my turn? ’Forgive me my foul murder’?</li>
  <li>That cannot be; since I am still possess’d</li>
  <li>Of those effects for which I did the murder,</li>
  <li>My crown, mine own ambition and my queen.</li>
  <li>May one be pardon’d and retain the offence?</li>
  <li class="number">In the corrupted currents of this world</li>
  <li>Offence’s gilded hand may shove by justice,</li>
  <li>And oft ’tis seen the wicked prize itself</li>
  <li>Buys out the law: but ’tis not so above;</li>
  <li>There is no shuffling, there the action lies</li>
  <li class="number">In his true nature; and we ourselves compell’d,</li>
  <li>Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,</li>
  <li>To give in evidence. What then? what rests?</li>
  <li>Try what repentance can: what can it not?</li>
  <li>Yet what can it when one can not repent?</li>
  <li class="number">O wretched state! O bosom black as death!</li>
  <li>O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,</li>
  <li>Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay!</li>
  <li>Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel,</li>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>Look here, upon this picture, and on this,</li>
  <li>The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.</li>
  <li>See, what a grace was seated on this brow;</li>
  <li>Hyperion’s curls; the front of Jove himself;</li>
  <li class="number">An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;</li>
  <li>A station like the herald Mercury</li>
  <li>New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;</li>
  <li>A combination and a form indeed,</li>
  <li>Where every god did seem to set his seal,</li>
  <li class="number">To give the world assurance of a man:</li>
  <li>This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:</li>
  <li>Here is your husband; like a mildew’d ear,</li>
  <li>Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?</li>
  <li>Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,</li>
  <li class="number">And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?</li>
  <li>You cannot call it love; for at your age</li>
  <li>The hey-day in the blood is tame, it’s humble,</li>
  <li>And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment</li>
  <li>Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,</li>
  <li class="number">Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense</li>
  <li>Is apoplex’d; for madness would not err,</li>
  <li>Nor sense to ecstasy was ne’er so thrall’d</li>
  <li>But it reserved some quantity of choice,</li>
  <li>To serve in such a difference. What devil was’t</li>
  <li class="number">That thus hath cozen’d you at hoodman-blind?</li>
  <li>Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,</li>
  <li>Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,</li>
  <li>Or but a sickly part of one true sense</li>
  <li>Could not so mope.</li>
  <li class="number">O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,</li>
  <li>If thou canst mutine in a matron’s bones,</li>
  <li>To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,</li>
  <li>And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame</li>
  <li>When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,</li>

  <li>On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares!</li>

  <li>Lest with this piteous action you convert</li>

<h3>SCENE VII.  Another room in the castle.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter KING CLAUDIUS and LAERTES</div>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li>Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal,</li>
  <li>And you must put me in your heart for friend,</li>
  <li>Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,</li>
  <li>That he which hath your noble father slain</li>
  <li class="number">Pursued my life.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAERTES">
  <li>It well appears: but tell me</li>
  <li>Why you proceeded not against these feats,</li>
  <li>So crimeful and so capital in nature,</li>
  <li>As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,</li>
  <li class="number">You mainly were stirr’d up.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li>O, for two special reasons;</li>
  <li>Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew’d,</li>
  <li>But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother</li>
  <li>Lives almost by his looks; and for myself — </li>
  <li class="number">My virtue or my plague, be it either which — </li>
  <li>She’s so conjunctive to my life and soul,</li>
  <li>That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,</li>
  <li>I could not but by her. The other motive,</li>
  <li>Why to a public count I might not go,</li>
  <li class="number">Is the great love the general gender bear him;</li>
  <li>Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,</li>
  <li>Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,</li>
  <li>Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,</li>
  <li>Too slightly timber’d for so loud a wind,</li>
  <li class="number">Would have reverted to my bow again,</li>
  <li>And not where I had aim’d them.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAERTES">
  <li>And so have I a noble father lost;</li>
  <li>A sister driven into desperate terms,</li>
  <li>Whose worth, if praises may go back again,</li>
  <li class="number">Stood challenger on mount of all the age</li>
  <li>For her perfections: but my revenge will come.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li>Break not your sleeps for that: you must not think</li>
  <li>That we are made of stuff so flat and dull</li>
  <li>That we can let our beard be shook with danger</li>
  <li class="number">And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:</li>
  <li>I loved your father, and we love ourself;</li>
  <li>And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine — </li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter a Messenger</li>
  <li>How now! what news?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Messenger">
  <li>Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:</li>
  <li class="number">This to your majesty; this to the queen.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li>From Hamlet! who brought them?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Messenger">
  <li>Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not:</li>
  <li>They were given me by Claudio; he received them</li>
  <li>Of him that brought them.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li class="number">Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exit Messenger</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Reads</li>
  <li>’High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on</li>
  <li>your kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see</li>
  <li>your kingly eyes: when I shall, first asking your</li>
  <li>pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden</li>
  <li class="number">and more strange return.                  ’HAMLET.’</li>
  <li>What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?</li>
  <li>Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAERTES">
  <li>Know you the hand?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li>’Tis Hamlets character. ’Naked!</li>
  <li class="number">And in a postscript here, he says ’alone.’</li>
  <li>Can you advise me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAERTES">
  <li>I’m lost in it, my lord. But let him come;</li>
  <li>It warms the very sickness in my heart,</li>
  <li>That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,</li>
  <li class="number">’Thus didest thou.’</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li>If it be so, Laertes — </li>
  <li>As how should it be so? how otherwise? — </li>
  <li>Will you be ruled by me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAERTES">
  <li>Ay, my lord;</li>
  <li class="number">So you will not o’errule me to a peace.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li>To thine own peace. If he be now return’d,</li>
  <li>As checking at his voyage, and that he means</li>
  <li>No more to undertake it, I will work him</li>
  <li>To an exploit, now ripe in my device,</li>
  <li class="number">Under the which he shall not choose but fall:</li>
  <li>And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,</li>
  <li>But even his mother shall uncharge the practise</li>
  <li>And call it accident.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAERTES">
  <li>My lord, I will be ruled;</li>
  <li class="number">The rather, if you could devise it so</li>
  <li>That I might be the organ.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li>It falls right.</li>
  <li>You have been talk’d of since your travel much,</li>
  <li>And that in Hamlet’s hearing, for a quality</li>
  <li class="number">Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts</li>
  <li>Did not together pluck such envy from him</li>
  <li>As did that one, and that, in my regard,</li>
  <li>Of the unworthiest siege.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAERTES">
  <li>What part is that, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li class="number">A very riband in the cap of youth,</li>
  <li>Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes</li>
  <li>The light and careless livery that it wears</li>
  <li>Than settled age his sables and his weeds,</li>
  <li>Importing health and graveness. Two months since,</li>
  <li class="number">Here was a gentleman of Normandy: — </li>
  <li>I’ve seen myself, and served against, the French,</li>
  <li>And they can well on horseback: but this gallant</li>
  <li>Had witchcraft in’t; he grew unto his seat;</li>
  <li>And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,</li>
  <li class="number">As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured</li>
  <li>With the brave beast: so far he topp’d my thought,</li>
  <li>That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,</li>
  <li>Come short of what he did.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAERTES">
  <li>A Norman was’t?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li class="number">A Norman.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAERTES">
  <li>Upon my life, Lamond.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li>The very same.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAERTES">
  <li>I know him well: he is the brooch indeed</li>
  <li>And gem of all the nation.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li class="number">He made confession of you,</li>
  <li>And gave you such a masterly report</li>
  <li>For art and exercise in your defence</li>
  <li>And for your rapier most especially,</li>
  <li>That he cried out, ’twould be a sight indeed,</li>
  <li class="number">If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,</li>
  <li>He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,</li>
  <li>If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his</li>
  <li>Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy</li>
  <li>That he could nothing do but wish and beg</li>
  <li class="number">Your sudden coming o’er, to play with him.</li>
  <li>Now, out of this — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAERTES">
  <li>What out of this, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li>Laertes, was your father dear to you?</li>
  <li>Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,</li>
  <li class="number">A face without a heart?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAERTES">
  <li>Why ask you this?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li>Not that I think you did not love your father;</li>
  <li>But that I know love is begun by time;</li>
  <li>And that I see, in passages of proof,</li>
  <li class="number">Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.</li>
  <li>There lives within the very flame of love</li>
  <li>A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;</li>
  <li>And nothing is at a like goodness still;</li>
  <li>For goodness, growing to a plurisy,</li>
  <li class="number">Dies in his own too much: that we would do</li>
  <li>We should do when we would; for this ’would’ changes</li>
  <li>And hath abatements and delays as many</li>
  <li>As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;</li>
  <li>And then this ’should’ is like a spendthrift sigh,</li>
  <li class="number">That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o’ the ulcer: — </li>
  <li>Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,</li>
  <li>To show yourself your father’s son in deed</li>
  <li>More than in words?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAERTES">
  <li>To cut his throat i’ the church.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li class="number">No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;</li>
  <li>Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,</li>
  <li>Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.</li>
  <li>Hamlet return’d shall know you are come home:</li>
  <li>We’ll put on those shall praise your excellence</li>
  <li class="number">And set a double varnish on the fame</li>
  <li>The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together</li>
  <li>And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,</li>
  <li>Most generous and free from all contriving,</li>
  <li>Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,</li>
  <li class="number">Or with a little shuffling, you may choose</li>
  <li>A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise</li>
  <li>Requite him for your father.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAERTES">
  <li>I will do’t:</li>
  <li>And, for that purpose, I’ll anoint my sword.</li>
  <li class="number">I bought an unction of a mountebank,</li>
  <li>So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,</li>
  <li>Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,</li>
  <li>Collected from all simples that have virtue</li>
  <li>Under the moon, can save the thing from death</li>
  <li class="number">That is but scratch’d withal: I’ll touch my point</li>
  <li>With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,</li>
  <li>It may be death.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING CLAUDIUS">
  <li>Let’s further think of this;</li>
  <li>Weigh what convenience both of time and means</li>
  <li class="number">May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,</li>
  <li>And that our drift look through our bad performance,</li>
  <li>’Twere better not assay’d: therefore this project</li>
  <li>Should have a back or second, that might hold,</li>
  <li>If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:</li>
  <li class="number">We’ll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha’t.</li>
  <li>When in your motion you are hot and dry — </li>
  <li>As make your bouts more violent to that end — </li>
  <li>And that he calls for drink, I’ll have prepared him</li>
  <li>A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,</li>
  <li class="number">If he by chance escape your venom’d stuck,</li>
  <li>Our purpose may hold there.</li>

  <li>My sea-gown scarf’d about me, in the dark</li>
  <li class="number">Groped I to find out them; had my desire.</li>
  <li>Finger’d their packet, and in fine withdrew</li>
  <li>To mine own room again; making so bold,</li>
  <li>My fears forgetting manners, to unseal</li>
  <li>Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio — </li>
  <li class="number">O royal knavery! — an exact command,</li>
  <li>Larded with many several sorts of reasons</li>
  <li>Importing Denmark’s health and England’s too,</li>
  <li>With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,</li>
  <li>That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORATIO">
  <li class="number">I beseech you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>Being thus be-netted round with villanies — </li>
  <li>Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,</li>
  <li>They had begun the play — I sat me down,</li>
  <li>Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:</li>
  <li class="number">I once did hold it, as our statists do,</li>
  <li>A baseness to write fair and labour’d much</li>
  <li>How to forget that learning, but, sir, now</li>
  <li>It did me yeoman’s service: wilt thou know</li>
  <li>The effect of what I wrote?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORATIO">
  <li class="number">Ay, good my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>An earnest conjuration from the king,</li>
  <li>As England was his faithful tributary,</li>
  <li>As love between them like the palm might flourish,</li>
  <li>As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear</li>
  <li class="number">And stand a comma ’tween their amities,</li>
  <li>And many such-like ’As’es of great charge,</li>
  <li>That, on the view and knowing of these contents,</li>
  <li>Without debatement further, more or less,</li>
  <li>He should the bearers put to sudden death,</li>

  <li>How was this seal’d?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.</li>
  <li>I had my father’s signet in my purse,</li>
  <li>Which was the model of that Danish seal;</li>
  <li class="number">Folded the writ up in form of the other,</li>
  <li>Subscribed it, gave’t the impression, placed it safely,</li>
  <li>The changeling never known. Now, the next day</li>
  <li>Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent</li>
  <li>Thou know’st already.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORATIO">
  <li class="number">So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>Why, man, they did make love to this employment;</li>
  <li>They are not near my conscience; their defeat</li>
  <li>Does by their own insinuation grow:</li>
  <li>’Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes</li>
  <li class="number">Between the pass and fell incensed points</li>
  <li>Of mighty opposites.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORATIO">
  <li>Why, what a king is this!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>Does it not, think’st thee, stand me now upon — </li>
  <li>He that hath kill’d my king and whored my mother,</li>
  <li class="number">Popp’d in between the election and my hopes,</li>
  <li>Thrown out his angle for my proper life,</li>
  <li>And with such cozenage — is’t not perfect conscience,</li>
  <li>To quit him with this arm? and is’t not to be damn’d,</li>
  <li>To let this canker of our nature come</li>
  <li class="number">In further evil?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORATIO">
  <li>It must be shortly known to him from England</li>
  <li>What is the issue of the business there.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>It will be short: the interim is mine;</li>
  <li>And a man’s life’s no more than to say ’One.’</li>
  <li class="number">But I am very sorry, good Horatio,</li>
  <li>That to Laertes I forgot myself;</li>
  <li>For, by the image of my cause, I see</li>
  <li>The portraiture of his: I’ll court his favours.</li>
  <li>But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me</li>

  <li>Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe</li>
  <li>me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent</li>
  <li>differences, of very soft society and great showing:</li>
  <li>indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;</li>
  <li>though, I know, to divide him inventorially would</li>
  <li>dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw</li>
  <li class="number">neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the</li>
  <li>verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of</li>
  <li>great article; and his infusion of such dearth and</li>
  <li>rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his</li>
  <li>semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace</li>
  <li class="number">him, his umbrage, nothing more.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OSRIC">
  <li>Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.</li>

  <li>Of Laertes?</li>

  <li>I know you are not ignorant — </li>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,</li>
  <li>it would not much approve me. Well, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OSRIC">
  <li>You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li class="number">I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with</li>
  <li>him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to</li>
  <li>know himself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OSRIC">
  <li>I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation</li>
  <li>laid on him by them, in his meed he’s unfellowed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li class="number">What’s his weapon?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OSRIC">
  <li>Rapier and dagger.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>That’s two of his weapons: but, well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OSRIC">
  <li>The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary</li>
  <li>horses: against the which he has imponed, as I take</li>
  <li class="number">it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their</li>
  <li>assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the</li>
  <li>carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very</li>
  <li>responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,</li>
  <li>and of very liberal conceit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li class="number">What call you the carriages?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORATIO">
  <li>I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.</li>
</ol>

  <li>The carriages, sir, are the hangers.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we</li>
  <li>could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might</li>
  <li class="number">be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses</li>
  <li>against six French swords, their assigns, and three</li>
  <li>liberal-conceited carriages; that’s the French bet</li>
  <li>against the Danish. Why is this ’imponed,’ as you call it?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OSRIC">
  <li>The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes</li>
  <li class="number">between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you</li>
  <li>three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it</li>
  <li>would come to immediate trial, if your lordship</li>
  <li>would vouchsafe the answer.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>How if I answer ’no’?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OSRIC">
  <li class="number">I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAMLET">
  <li>Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his</li>
  <li>majesty, ’tis the breathing time of day with me; let</li>
  <li>the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the</li>
  <li>king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;</li>
  <li class="number">if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.</li>

  <li>As thou’rt a man,</li>

  <li>O, I die, Horatio;</li>
  <li>The potent poison quite o’er-crows my spirit:</li>

  <li>On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;</li>
  <li>So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,</li>

  <li>Where is this sight?</li>

<ol data-speaker="HORATIO">
  <li>What is it ye would see?</li>
  <li class="number">If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE FORTINBRAS">
  <li>This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,</li>
  <li>What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,</li>
  <li>That thou so many princes at a shot</li>
  <li>So bloodily hast struck?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Ambassador">
  <li class="number">The sight is dismal;</li>
  <li>And our affairs from England come too late:</li>
  <li>The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,</li>
  <li>To tell him his commandment is fulfill’d,</li>
  <li>That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:</li>
  <li class="number">Where should we have our thanks?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORATIO">
  <li>Not from his mouth,</li>
  <li>Had it the ability of life to thank you:</li>
  <li>He never gave commandment for their death.</li>
  <li>But since, so jump upon this bloody question,</li>
  <li class="number">You from the Polack wars, and you from England,</li>
  <li>Are here arrived give order that these bodies</li>
  <li>High on a stage be placed to the view;</li>
  <li>And let me speak to the yet unknowing world</li>
  <li>How these things came about: so shall you hear</li>
  <li class="number">Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,</li>
  <li>Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,</li>
  <li>Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,</li>
  <li>And, in this upshot, purposes mistook</li>
  <li>Fall’n on the inventors’ reads: all this can I</li>
  <li class="number">Truly deliver.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE FORTINBRAS">
  <li>Let us haste to hear it,</li>
  <li>And call the noblest to the audience.</li>
  <li>For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:</li>
  <li>I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,</li>
  <li class="number">Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORATIO">
  <li>Of that I shall have also cause to speak,</li>
  <li>And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;</li>
  <li>But let this same be presently perform’d,</li>
  <li>Even while men’s minds are wild; lest more mischance</li>
  <li class="number">On plots and errors, happen.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE FORTINBRAS">
  <li>Let four captains</li>
  <li>Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;</li>
  <li>For he was likely, had he been put on,</li>
  <li>To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,</li>
  <li class="number">The soldiers’ music and the rites of war</li>
  <li>Speak loudly for him.</li>
  <li>Take up the bodies: such a sight as this</li>
  <li>Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.</li>
  <li>Go, bid the soldiers shoot.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">A dead march. Exeunt, bearing off the dead
bodies; after which a peal of ordnance is shot off</div>
