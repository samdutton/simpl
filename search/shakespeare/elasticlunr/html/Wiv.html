  <li>give the dozen white luces in their coat.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHALLOW">
  <li class="number">It is an old coat.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR HUGH EVANS">
  <li>The dozen white louses do become an old coat well;</li>
  <li>it agrees well, passant; it is a familiar beast to</li>
  <li>man, and signifies love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHALLOW">
  <li>The luce is the fresh fish; the salt fish is an old coat.</li>

  <li>fear of Got in a riot: the council, look you, shall</li>
  <li>desire to hear the fear of Got, and not to hear a</li>
  <li class="number">riot; take your vizaments in that.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHALLOW">
  <li>Ha! o’ my life, if I were young again, the sword</li>

  <li> — give, when she is able to overtake seventeen years</li>
  <li class="number">old: it were a goot motion if we leave our pribbles</li>
  <li>and prabbles, and desire a marriage between Master</li>
  <li>Abraham and Mistress Anne Page.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SLENDER">

  <li>myself, fidelicet myself; and the three party is,</li>
  <li>lastly and finally, mine host of the Garter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAGE">
  <li class="number">We three, to hear it and end it between them.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR HUGH EVANS">
  <li>Fery goot: I will make a prief of it in my note-</li>
  <li>book; and we will afterwards ork upon the cause with</li>
  <li>as great discreetly as we can.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Pistol!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PISTOL">
  <li class="number">He hears with ears.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR HUGH EVANS">
  <li>The tevil and his tam! what phrase is this, ’He</li>
  <li>hears with ear’? why, it is affectations.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Pistol, did you pick Master Slender’s purse?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SLENDER">
  <li>Ay, by these gloves, did he, or I would I might</li>
  <li class="number">never come in mine own great chamber again else, of</li>
  <li>seven groats in mill-sixpences, and two Edward</li>
  <li>shovel-boards, that cost me two shilling and two</li>
  <li>pence apiece of Yead Miller, by these gloves.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Is this true, Pistol?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR HUGH EVANS">
  <li class="number">No; it is false, if it is a pick-purse.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PISTOL">
  <li>Ha, thou mountain-foreigner! Sir John and Master mine,</li>
  <li>I combat challenge of this latten bilbo.</li>
  <li>Word of denial in thy labras here!</li>
  <li>Word of denial: froth and scum, thou liest!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SLENDER">
  <li class="number">By these gloves, then, ’twas he.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NYM">
  <li>Be avised, sir, and pass good humours: I will say</li>
  <li>’marry trap’ with you, if you run the nuthook’s</li>
  <li>humour on me; that is the very note of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SLENDER">
  <li>By this hat, then, he in the red face had it; for</li>
  <li class="number">though I cannot remember what I did when you made me</li>
  <li>drunk, yet I am not altogether an ass.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>What say you, Scarlet and John?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BARDOLPH">
  <li>Why, sir, for my part I say the gentleman had drunk</li>
  <li>himself out of his five sentences.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR HUGH EVANS">
  <li class="number">It is his five senses: fie, what the ignorance is!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BARDOLPH">
  <li>And being fap, sir, was, as they say, cashiered; and</li>
  <li>so conclusions passed the careires.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SLENDER">
  <li>Ay, you spake in Latin then too; but ’tis no</li>
  <li>matter: I’ll ne’er be drunk whilst I live again,</li>
  <li class="number">but in honest, civil, godly company, for this trick:</li>
  <li>if I be drunk, I’ll be drunk with those that have</li>
  <li>the fear of God, and not with drunken knaves.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR HUGH EVANS">
  <li>So Got udge me, that is a virtuous mind.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>You hear all these matters denied, gentlemen; you hear it.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter ANNE PAGE, with wine; MISTRESS FORD

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt all except SHALLOW, SLENDER, and SIR HUGH EVANS</div>

  <li>I had rather than forty shillings I had my Book of</li>

  <li class="stage-direction">Enter SIMPLE</li>
  <li class="number">How now, Simple! where have you been? I must wait</li>
  <li>on myself, must I? You have not the Book of Riddles</li>
  <li>about you, have you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIMPLE">
  <li>Book of Riddles! why, did you not lend it to Alice</li>
  <li>Shortcake upon All-hallowmas last, a fortnight</li>
  <li class="number">afore Michaelmas?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHALLOW">
  <li>Come, coz; come, coz; we stay for you. A word with</li>
  <li>you, coz; marry, this, coz: there is, as ’twere, a</li>
  <li>tender, a kind of tender, made afar off by Sir Hugh</li>
  <li>here. Do you understand me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SLENDER">
  <li class="number">Ay, sir, you shall find me reasonable; if it be so,</li>
  <li>I shall do that that is reason.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHALLOW">
  <li>Nay, but understand me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SLENDER">
  <li>So I do, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR HUGH EVANS">
  <li>Give ear to his motions, Master Slender: I will</li>
  <li class="number">description the matter to you, if you be capacity of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SLENDER">
  <li>Nay, I will do as my cousin Shallow says: I pray</li>
  <li>you, pardon me; he’s a justice of peace in his</li>
  <li>country, simple though I stand here.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR HUGH EVANS">
  <li>But that is not the question: the question is</li>
  <li class="number">concerning your marriage.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHALLOW">
  <li>Ay, there’s the point, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR HUGH EVANS">
  <li>Marry, is it; the very point of it; to Mistress Anne Page.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SLENDER">
  <li>Why, if it be so, I will marry her upon any</li>
  <li>reasonable demands.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR HUGH EVANS">
  <li class="number">But can you affection the ’oman? Let us command to</li>
  <li>know that of your mouth or of your lips; for divers</li>
  <li>philosophers hold that the lips is parcel of the</li>
  <li>mouth. Therefore, precisely, can you carry your</li>
  <li>good will to the maid?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHALLOW">
  <li class="number">Cousin Abraham Slender, can you love her?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SLENDER">
  <li>I hope, sir, I will do as it shall become one that</li>
  <li>would do reason.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR HUGH EVANS">
  <li>Nay, Got’s lords and his ladies! you must speak</li>
  <li>possitable, if you can carry her your desires</li>
  <li class="number">towards her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHALLOW">
  <li>That you must. Will you, upon good dowry, marry her?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SLENDER">
  <li>I will do a greater thing than that, upon your</li>
  <li>request, cousin, in any reason.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHALLOW">
  <li>Nay, conceive me, conceive me, sweet coz: what I do</li>
  <li class="number">is to pleasure you, coz. Can you love the maid?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SLENDER">
  <li>I will marry her, sir, at your request: but if there</li>
  <li>be no great love in the beginning, yet heaven may</li>
  <li>decrease it upon better acquaintance, when we are</li>
  <li>married and have more occasion to know one another;</li>
  <li class="number">I hope, upon familiarity will grow more contempt:</li>
  <li>but if you say, ’Marry her,’ I will marry her; that</li>
  <li>I am freely dissolved, and dissolutely.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR HUGH EVANS">
  <li>It is a fery discretion answer; save the fall is in</li>
  <li>the ort ’dissolutely:’ the ort is, according to our</li>
  <li class="number">meaning, ’resolutely:’ his meaning is good.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHALLOW">
  <li>Ay, I think my cousin meant well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SLENDER">
  <li>Ay, or else I would I might be hanged, la!</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE PAGE">
  <li>I pray you, sir, walk in.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SLENDER">
  <li>I had rather walk here, I thank you. I bruised</li>
  <li class="number">my shin th’ other day with playing at sword and</li>
  <li>dagger with a master of fence; three veneys for a</li>
  <li>dish of stewed prunes; and, by my troth, I cannot</li>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE PAGE">
  <li class="number">I think there are, sir; I heard them talked of.</li>

<ol data-speaker="SLENDER">
  <li>I love the sport well but I shall as soon quarrel at</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE PAGE">
  <li>Ay, indeed, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SLENDER">
  <li class="number">That’s meat and drink to me, now. I have seen</li>
  <li>Sackerson loose twenty times, and have taken him by</li>
  <li>the chain; but, I warrant you, the women have so</li>
  <li>cried and shrieked at it, that it passed: but women,</li>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>I am glad I am so acquit of this tinderbox: his</li>
  <li class="number">thefts were too open; his filching was like an</li>
  <li>unskilful singer; he kept not time.</li>

<ol data-speaker="NYM">

  <li>My honest lads, I will tell you what I am about.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PISTOL">
  <li>Two yards, and more.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>No quips now, Pistol! Indeed, I am in the waist two</li>
  <li>yards about; but I am now about no waste; I am about</li>
  <li class="number">thrift. Briefly, I do mean to make love to Ford’s</li>
  <li>wife: I spy entertainment in her; she discourses,</li>
  <li>she carves, she gives the leer of invitation: I</li>
  <li>can construe the action of her familiar style; and</li>
  <li>the hardest voice of her behavior, to be Englished</li>
  <li class="number">rightly, is, ’I am Sir John Falstaff’s.’</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PISTOL">
  <li>He hath studied her will, and translated her will,</li>

  <li>The anchor is deep: will that humour pass?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Now, the report goes she has all the rule of her</li>
  <li class="number">husband’s purse: he hath a legion of angels.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PISTOL">
  <li>As many devils entertain; and ’To her, boy,’ say I.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NYM">
  <li>The humour rises; it is good: humour me the angels.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>I have writ me here a letter to her: and here</li>
  <li>another to Page’s wife, who even now gave me good</li>
  <li class="number">eyes too, examined my parts with most judicious</li>
  <li>oeillades; sometimes the beam of her view gilded my</li>
  <li>foot, sometimes my portly belly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PISTOL">
  <li>Then did the sun on dunghill shine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NYM">
  <li>I thank thee for that humour.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li class="number">O, she did so course o’er my exteriors with such a</li>
  <li>greedy intention, that the appetite of her eye did</li>
  <li>seem to scorch me up like a burning-glass! Here’s</li>
  <li>another letter to her: she bears the purse too; she</li>
  <li>is a region in Guiana, all gold and bounty. I will</li>
  <li class="number">be cheater to them both, and they shall be</li>
  <li>exchequers to me; they shall be my East and West</li>
  <li>Indies, and I will trade to them both. Go bear thou</li>
  <li>this letter to Mistress Page; and thou this to</li>
  <li>Mistress Ford: we will thrive, lads, we will thrive.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PISTOL">
  <li class="number">Shall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become,</li>
  <li>And by my side wear steel? then, Lucifer take all!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NYM">
  <li>I will run no base humour: here, take the</li>
  <li>humour-letter: I will keep the havior of reputation.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li><stagedir>To ROBIN</stagedir>  Hold, sirrah, bear you these letters tightly;</li>
  <li class="number">Sail like my pinnace to these golden shores.</li>
  <li>Rogues, hence, avaunt! vanish like hailstones, go;</li>
  <li>Trudge, plod away o’ the hoof; seek shelter, pack!</li>
  <li>Falstaff will learn the humour of the age,</li>
  <li>French thrift, you rogues; myself and skirted page.</li>

  <li>How Falstaff, varlet vile,</li>
  <li>His dove will prove, his gold will hold,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS FORD">
  <li>Nay, I’ll ne’er believe that; I have to show to the contrary.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS PAGE">
  <li class="number">Faith, but you do, in my mind.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS FORD">
  <li>Well, I do then; yet I say I could show you to the</li>
  <li>contrary. O Mistress Page, give me some counsel!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS PAGE">
  <li>What’s the matter, woman?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS FORD">
  <li>O woman, if it were not for one trifling respect, I</li>
  <li class="number">could come to such honour!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS PAGE">
  <li>Hang the trifle, woman! take the honour. What is</li>
  <li>it? dispense with trifles; what is it?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS FORD">
  <li>If I would but go to hell for an eternal moment or so,</li>
  <li>I could be knighted.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS PAGE">
  <li class="number">What? thou liest! Sir Alice Ford! These knights</li>
  <li>will hack; and so thou shouldst not alter the</li>
  <li>article of thy gentry.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS FORD">
  <li>We burn daylight: here, read, read; perceive how I</li>
  <li>might be knighted. I shall think the worse of fat</li>
  <li class="number">men, as long as I have an eye to make difference of</li>
  <li>men’s liking: and yet he would not swear; praised</li>
  <li>women’s modesty; and gave such orderly and</li>
  <li>well-behaved reproof to all uncomeliness, that I</li>
  <li>would have sworn his disposition would have gone to</li>
  <li class="number">the truth of his words; but they do no more adhere</li>
  <li>and keep place together than the Hundredth Psalm to</li>
  <li>the tune of ’Green Sleeves.’ What tempest, I trow,</li>
  <li>threw this whale, with so many tuns of oil in his</li>
  <li>belly, ashore at Windsor? How shall I be revenged</li>
  <li class="number">on him? I think the best way were to entertain him</li>
  <li>with hope, till the wicked fire of lust have melted</li>
  <li>him in his own grease. Did you ever hear the like?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS PAGE">
  <li>Letter for letter, but that the name of Page and</li>
  <li>Ford differs! To thy great comfort in this mystery</li>
  <li class="number">of ill opinions, here’s the twin-brother of thy</li>
  <li>letter: but let thine inherit first; for, I</li>
  <li>protest, mine never shall. I warrant he hath a</li>
  <li>thousand of these letters, writ with blank space for</li>
  <li>different names — sure, more — and these are of the</li>
  <li class="number">second edition: he will print them, out of doubt;</li>
  <li>for he cares not what he puts into the press, when</li>
  <li>he would put us two. I had rather be a giantess,</li>
  <li>and lie under Mount Pelion. Well, I will find you</li>
  <li>twenty lascivious turtles ere one chaste man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS FORD">
  <li class="number">Why, this is the very same; the very hand, the very</li>
  <li>words. What doth he think of us?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS PAGE">
  <li>Nay, I know not: it makes me almost ready to</li>
  <li>wrangle with mine own honesty. I’ll entertain</li>
  <li>myself like one that I am not acquainted withal;</li>
  <li class="number">for, sure, unless he know some strain in me, that I</li>
  <li>know not myself, he would never have boarded me in this fury.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS FORD">
  <li>’Boarding,’ call you it? I’ll be sure to keep him</li>
  <li>above deck.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS PAGE">
  <li>So will I if he come under my hatches, I’ll never</li>
  <li class="number">to sea again. Let’s be revenged on him: let’s</li>
  <li>appoint him a meeting; give him a show of comfort in</li>
  <li>his suit and lead him on with a fine-baited delay,</li>
  <li>till he hath pawned his horses to mine host of the Garter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS FORD">
  <li>Nay, I will consent to act any villany against him,</li>
  <li class="number">that may not sully the chariness of our honesty. O,</li>
  <li>that my husband saw this letter! it would give</li>
  <li>eternal food to his jealousy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS PAGE">
  <li>Why, look where he comes; and my good man too: he’s</li>
  <li>as far from jealousy as I am from giving him cause;</li>
  <li class="number">and that I hope is an unmeasurable distance.</li>
</ol>

  <li>wonderful. The best courtier of them all, when the</li>
  <li>court lay at Windsor, could never have brought her</li>
  <li class="number">to such a canary. Yet there has been knights, and</li>
  <li>lords, and gentlemen, with their coaches, I warrant</li>
  <li>you, coach after coach, letter after letter, gift</li>
  <li>after gift; smelling so sweetly, all musk, and so</li>
  <li>rushling, I warrant you, in silk and gold; and in</li>
  <li class="number">such alligant terms; and in such wine and sugar of</li>
  <li>the best and the fairest, that would have won any</li>
  <li>woman’s heart; and, I warrant you, they could never</li>
  <li>get an eye-wink of her: I had myself twenty angels</li>
  <li>given me this morning; but I defy all angels, in</li>
  <li class="number">any such sort, as they say, but in the way of</li>
  <li>honesty: and, I warrant you, they could never get</li>
  <li>her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of</li>
  <li>them all: and yet there has been earls, nay, which</li>
  <li>is more, pensioners; but, I warrant you, all is one with her.</li>

  <li>Ay, forsooth; and then you may come and see the</li>

  <li>her husband, will be from home. Alas! the sweet</li>
  <li class="number">woman leads an ill life with him: he’s a very</li>

  <li>him, good heart.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Ten and eleven. Woman, commend me to her; I will</li>
  <li>not fail her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS QUICKLY">
  <li class="number">Why, you say well. But I have another messenger to</li>
  <li>your worship. Mistress Page hath her hearty</li>
  <li>commendations to you too: and let me tell you in</li>
  <li>your ear, she’s as fartuous a civil modest wife, and</li>
  <li>one, I tell you, that will not miss you morning nor</li>
  <li class="number">evening prayer, as any is in Windsor, whoe’er be the</li>
  <li>other: and she bade me tell your worship that her</li>
  <li>husband is seldom from home; but she hopes there</li>
  <li>will come a time. I never knew a woman so dote upon</li>
  <li>a man: surely I think you have charms, la; yes, in truth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li class="number">Not I, I assure thee: setting the attractions of my</li>
  <li>good parts aside I have no other charms.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS QUICKLY">
  <li>Blessing on your heart for’t!</li>

  <li>But, I pray thee, tell me this: has Ford’s wife and</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS QUICKLY">
  <li class="number">That were a jest indeed! they have not so little</li>
  <li>grace, I hope: that were a trick indeed! but</li>
  <li>Mistress Page would desire you to send her your</li>
  <li>little page, of all loves: her husband has a</li>
  <li>marvellous infection to the little page; and truly</li>
  <li class="number">Master Page is an honest man. Never a wife in</li>
  <li>Windsor leads a better life than she does: do what</li>
  <li>she will, say what she will, take all, pay all, go</li>
  <li>to bed when she list, rise when she list, all is as</li>
  <li>she will: and truly she deserves it; for if there</li>
  <li class="number">be a kind woman in Windsor, she is one. You must</li>
  <li>send her your page; no remedy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Why, I will.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Good Master Brook, I desire more acquaintance of you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD">
  <li>Good Sir John, I sue for yours: not to charge you;</li>

  <li>better plight for a lender than you are: the which</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Sir, I know not how I may deserve to be your porter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD">
  <li class="number">I will tell you, sir, if you will give me the hearing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Speak, good Master Brook: I shall be glad to be</li>
  <li>your servant.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD">
  <li>Sir, I hear you are a scholar — I will be brief</li>
  <li>with you — and you have been a man long known to me,</li>
  <li class="number">though I had never so good means, as desire, to make</li>
  <li>myself acquainted with you. I shall discover a</li>
  <li>thing to you, wherein I must very much lay open mine</li>
  <li>own imperfection: but, good Sir John, as you have</li>
  <li>one eye upon my follies, as you hear them unfolded,</li>
  <li class="number">turn another into the register of your own; that I</li>
  <li>may pass with a reproof the easier, sith you</li>
  <li>yourself know how easy it is to be such an offender.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Very well, sir; proceed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD">
  <li>There is a gentlewoman in this town; her husband’s</li>
  <li class="number">name is Ford.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Well, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD">
  <li>I have long loved her, and, I protest to you,</li>
  <li>bestowed much on her; followed her with a doting</li>
  <li>observance; engrossed opportunities to meet her;</li>
  <li class="number">fee’d every slight occasion that could but niggardly</li>
  <li>give me sight of her; not only bought many presents</li>
  <li>to give her, but have given largely to many to know</li>
  <li>what she would have given; briefly, I have pursued</li>
  <li>her as love hath pursued me; which hath been on the</li>
  <li class="number">wing of all occasions. But whatsoever I have</li>
  <li>merited, either in my mind or, in my means, meed,</li>
  <li>I am sure, I have received none; unless experience</li>
  <li>be a jewel that I have purchased at an infinite</li>
  <li>rate, and that hath taught me to say this:</li>
  <li class="number">’Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues;</li>
  <li>Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.’</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Have you received no promise of satisfaction at her hands?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD">
  <li>Never.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Have you importuned her to such a purpose?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD">
  <li class="number">Never.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Of what quality was your love, then?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD">
  <li>Like a fair house built on another man’s ground; so</li>
  <li>that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place</li>
  <li>where I erected it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li class="number">To what purpose have you unfolded this to me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD">
  <li>When I have told you that, I have told you all.</li>
  <li>Some say, that though she appear honest to me, yet in</li>
  <li>other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that</li>
  <li>there is shrewd construction made of her. Now, Sir</li>
  <li class="number">John, here is the heart of my purpose: you are a</li>
  <li>gentleman of excellent breeding, admirable</li>
  <li>discourse, of great admittance, authentic in your</li>
  <li>place and person, generally allowed for your many</li>
  <li>war-like, court-like, and learned preparations.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li class="number">O, sir!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD">
  <li>Believe it, for you know it. There is money; spend</li>
  <li>it, spend it; spend more; spend all I have; only</li>
  <li>give me so much of your time in exchange of it, as</li>
  <li>to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this</li>
  <li class="number">Ford’s wife: use your art of wooing; win her to</li>
  <li>consent to you: if any man may, you may as soon as</li>
  <li>any.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Would it apply well to the vehemency of your</li>
  <li>affection, that I should win what you would enjoy?</li>
  <li class="number">Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD">
  <li>O, understand my drift. She dwells so securely on</li>
  <li>the excellency of her honour, that the folly of my</li>
  <li>soul dares not present itself: she is too bright to</li>
  <li>be looked against. Now, could I could come to her</li>
  <li class="number">with any detection in my hand, my desires had</li>
  <li>instance and argument to commend themselves: I</li>
  <li>could drive her then from the ward of her purity,</li>
  <li>her reputation, her marriage-vow, and a thousand</li>
  <li>other her defences, which now are too too strongly</li>
  <li class="number">embattled against me. What say you to’t, Sir John?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Master Brook, I will first make bold with your</li>
  <li>money; next, give me your hand; and last, as I am a</li>
  <li>gentleman, you shall, if you will, enjoy Ford’s wife.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD">
  <li>O good sir!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li class="number">I say you shall.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD">
  <li>Want no money, Sir John; you shall want none.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Want no Mistress Ford, Master Brook; you shall want</li>
  <li>none. I shall be with her, I may tell you, by her</li>
  <li>own appointment; even as you came in to me, her</li>
  <li class="number">assistant or go-between parted from me: I say I</li>
  <li>shall be with her between ten and eleven; for at</li>
  <li>that time the jealous rascally knave her husband</li>
  <li>will be forth. Come you to me at night; you shall</li>
  <li>know how I speed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD">
  <li class="number">I am blest in your acquaintance. Do you know Ford,</li>
  <li>sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Hang him, poor cuckoldly knave! I know him not:</li>
  <li>yet I wrong him to call him poor; they say the</li>
  <li>jealous wittolly knave hath masses of money; for the</li>
  <li class="number">which his wife seems to me well-favored. I will</li>
  <li>use her as the key of the cuckoldly rogue’s coffer;</li>
  <li>and there’s my harvest-home.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD">
  <li>I would you knew Ford, sir, that you might avoid him</li>
  <li>if you saw him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li class="number">Hang him, mechanical salt-butter rogue! I will</li>
  <li>stare him out of his wits; I will awe him with my</li>
  <li>cudgel: it shall hang like a meteor o’er the</li>
  <li>cuckold’s horns. Master Brook, thou shalt know I</li>
  <li>will predominate over the peasant, and thou shalt</li>
  <li class="number">lie with his wife. Come to me soon at night.</li>
  <li>Ford’s a knave, and I will aggravate his style;</li>
  <li>thou, Master Brook, shalt know him for knave and</li>
  <li>cuckold. Come to me soon at night.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

  <li>By the Lord, a buck-basket! rammed me in with foul</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I have</li>
  <li>suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good.</li>
  <li>Being thus crammed in the basket, a couple of Ford’s</li>
  <li>knaves, his hinds, were called forth by their</li>
  <li class="number">mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to</li>
  <li>Datchet-lane: they took me on their shoulders; met</li>
  <li>the jealous knave their master in the door, who</li>
  <li>asked them once or twice what they had in their</li>
  <li>basket: I quaked for fear, lest the lunatic knave</li>
  <li class="number">would have searched it; but fate, ordaining he</li>
  <li>should be a cuckold, held his hand. Well: on went he</li>
  <li>for a search, and away went I for foul clothes. But</li>
  <li>mark the sequel, Master Brook: I suffered the pangs</li>
  <li>of three several deaths; first, an intolerable</li>
  <li class="number">fright, to be detected with a jealous rotten</li>
  <li>bell-wether; next, to be compassed, like a good</li>
  <li>bilbo, in the circumference of a peck, hilt to</li>
  <li>point, heel to head; and then, to be stopped in,</li>
  <li>like a strong distillation, with stinking clothes</li>
  <li class="number">that fretted in their own grease: think of that — a</li>
  <li>man of my kidney — think of that — that am as subject</li>
  <li>to heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution</li>
  <li>and thaw: it was a miracle to scape suffocation.</li>
  <li>And in the height of this bath, when I was more than</li>
  <li class="number">half stewed in grease, like a Dutch dish, to be</li>
  <li>thrown into the Thames, and cooled, glowing hot,</li>
  <li>in that surge, like a horse-shoe; think of</li>
  <li>that — hissing hot — think of that, Master Brook.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD">
  <li>In good sadness, I am sorry that for my sake you</li>
  <li class="number">have sufferd all this. My suit then is desperate;</li>
  <li>you’ll undertake her no more?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Master Brook, I will be thrown into Etna, as I have</li>
  <li>been into Thames, ere I will leave her thus. Her</li>
  <li>husband is this morning gone a-birding: I have</li>
  <li class="number">received from her another embassy of meeting; ’twixt</li>
  <li>eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD">
  <li>’Tis past eight already, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Is it? I will then address me to my appointment.</li>
  <li>Come to me at your convenient leisure, and you shall</li>
  <li class="number">know how I speed; and the conclusion shall be</li>
  <li>crowned with your enjoying her. Adieu. You shall</li>
  <li>have her, Master Brook; Master Brook, you shall</li>
  <li>cuckold Ford.</li>

  <li>Why, woman, your husband is in his old lunes again:</li>

  <li>daughters, of what complexion soever; and so buffets</li>
  <li>himself on the forehead, crying, ’Peer out, peer</li>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS PAGE">
  <li>Of none but him; and swears he was carried out, the</li>

  <li>to my husband he is now here, and hath drawn him and</li>
  <li class="number">the rest of their company from their sport, to make</li>
  <li>another experiment of his suspicion: but I am glad</li>
  <li>the knight is not here; now he shall see his own foolery.</li>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS PAGE">
  <li>Why then you are utterly shamed, and he’s but a dead</li>

<ol data-speaker="SIR HUGH EVANS">
  <li class="number">You say he has been thrown in the rivers and has</li>

  <li>There is an old tale goes that Herne the hunter,</li>

  <li class="number">Doth all the winter-time, at still midnight,</li>
  <li>Walk round about an oak, with great ragg’d horns;</li>
  <li>And there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle</li>
  <li>And makes milch-kine yield blood and shakes a chain</li>
  <li>In a most hideous and dreadful manner:</li>
  <li class="number">You have heard of such a spirit, and well you know</li>
  <li>The superstitious idle-headed eld</li>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS PAGE">
  <li>That likewise have we thought upon, and thus:</li>
  <li>Nan Page my daughter and my little son</li>
  <li>And three or four more of their growth we’ll dress</li>
  <li class="number">Like urchins, ouphes and fairies, green and white,</li>
  <li>With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads,</li>
  <li>And rattles in their hands: upon a sudden,</li>
  <li>As Falstaff, she and I, are newly met,</li>
  <li>Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once</li>
  <li class="number">With some diffused song: upon their sight,</li>
  <li>We two in great amazedness will fly:</li>
  <li>Then let them all encircle him about</li>
  <li>And, fairy-like, to-pinch the unclean knight,</li>
  <li>And ask him why, that hour of fairy revel,</li>
  <li class="number">In their so sacred paths he dares to tread</li>
  <li>In shape profane.</li>

  <li>Prithee, no more prattling; go. I’ll hold. This is</li>
  <li>the third time; I hope good luck lies in odd</li>

  <li>odd numbers, either in nativity, chance, or death. Away!</li>

  <li>How now, Master Brook! Master Brook, the matter</li>

  <li>see wonders.</li>

<ol data-speaker="FORD">
  <li>Went you not to her yesterday, sir, as you told me</li>
  <li>you had appointed?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>I went to her, Master Brook, as you see, like a poor</li>
  <li class="number">old man: but I came from her, Master Brook, like a</li>
  <li>poor old woman. That same knave Ford, her husband,</li>
  <li>hath the finest mad devil of jealousy in him,</li>
  <li>Master Brook, that ever governed frenzy. I will tell</li>
  <li>you: he beat me grievously, in the shape of a</li>
  <li class="number">woman; for in the shape of man, Master Brook, I fear</li>
  <li>not Goliath with a weaver’s beam; because I know</li>
  <li>also life is a shuttle. I am in haste; go along</li>
  <li>with me: I’ll tell you all, Master Brook. Since I</li>
  <li>plucked geese, played truant and whipped top, I knew</li>
  <li class="number">not what ’twas to be beaten till lately. Follow</li>
  <li>me: I’ll tell you strange things of this knave</li>
  <li>Ford, on whom to-night I will be revenged, and I</li>
  <li>will deliver his wife into your hand. Follow.</li>
  <li>Strange things in hand, Master Brook! Follow.</li>

  <li>Ay, forsooth; I have spoke with her and we have a</li>

<ol data-speaker="SHALLOW">
  <li>That’s good too: but what needs either your ’mum’</li>

  <li>Remember, Jove, thou wast a bull for thy Europa; love</li>
  <li>set on thy horns. O powerful love! that, in some</li>
  <li class="number">respects, makes a beast a man, in some other, a man</li>
  <li>a beast. You were also, Jupiter, a swan for the love</li>
  <li>of Leda. O omnipotent Love! how near the god drew</li>
  <li>to the complexion of a goose! A fault done first in</li>
  <li>the form of a beast. O Jove, a beastly fault! And</li>
  <li class="number">then another fault in the semblance of a fowl; think</li>
  <li>on ’t, Jove; a foul fault! When gods have hot</li>
  <li>backs, what shall poor men do? For me, I am here a</li>
  <li>Windsor stag; and the fattest, I think, i’ the</li>
  <li>forest. Send me a cool rut-time, Jove, or who can</li>

  <li>Divide me like a bribe buck, each a haunch: I will</li>

  <li>Am I a woodman, ha? Speak I like Herne the hunter?</li>
  <li>Why, now is Cupid a child of conscience; he makes</li>

  <li>Fairies, black, grey, green, and white,</li>

  <li>Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.</li>
  <li>Cricket, to Windsor chimneys shalt thou leap:</li>
  <li>Where fires thou find’st unraked and hearths unswept,</li>
  <li>There pinch the maids as blue as bilberry:</li>
  <li class="number">Our radiant queen hates sluts and sluttery.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>They are fairies; he that speaks to them shall die:</li>

<ol data-speaker="SIR HUGH EVANS">
  <li>Where’s Bede? Go you, and where you find a maid</li>
  <li>That, ere she sleep, has thrice her prayers said,</li>
  <li class="number">Raise up the organs of her fantasy;</li>
  <li>Sleep she as sound as careless infancy:</li>
  <li>But those as sleep and think not on their sins,</li>
  <li>Pinch them, arms, legs, backs, shoulders, sides and shins.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS QUICKLY">
  <li>About, about;</li>
  <li class="number">Search Windsor Castle, elves, within and out:</li>

  <li>That it may stand till the perpetual doom,</li>
  <li>In state as wholesome as in state ’tis fit,</li>
  <li>Worthy the owner, and the owner it.</li>
  <li class="number">The several chairs of order look you scour</li>
  <li>With juice of balm and every precious flower:</li>
  <li>Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,</li>
  <li>With loyal blazon, evermore be blest!</li>
  <li>And nightly, meadow-fairies, look you sing,</li>
  <li class="number">Like to the Garter’s compass, in a ring:</li>
  <li>The expressure that it bears, green let it be,</li>
  <li>More fertile-fresh than all the field to see;</li>
  <li>And ’Honi soit qui mal y pense’ write</li>
  <li>In emerald tufts, flowers purple, blue and white;</li>
  <li class="number">Let sapphire, pearl and rich embroidery,</li>
  <li>Buckled below fair knighthood’s bending knee:</li>
  <li>Fairies use flowers for their charactery.</li>
  <li>Away; disperse: but till ’tis one o’clock,</li>
  <li>Our dance of custom round about the oak</li>
  <li class="number">Of Herne the hunter, let us not forget.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR HUGH EVANS">
  <li>Pray you, lock hand in hand; yourselves in order set</li>
  <li>And twenty glow-worms shall our lanterns be,</li>
  <li>To guide our measure round about the tree.</li>
  <li>But, stay; I smell a man of middle-earth.</li>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li class="number">Heavens defend me from that Welsh fairy, lest he</li>

  <li>Vile worm, thou wast o’erlook’d even in thy birth.</li>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS QUICKLY">
  <li>With trial-fire touch me his finger-end:</li>
  <li>If he be chaste, the flame will back descend</li>
  <li class="number">And turn him to no pain; but if he start,</li>
  <li>It is the flesh of a corrupted heart.</li>
</ol>

  <li>A trial, come.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR HUGH EVANS">
  <li>Come, will this wood take fire?</li>

<div class="stage-direction">They burn him with their tapers</div>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Oh, Oh, Oh!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS QUICKLY">
  <li class="number">Corrupt, corrupt, and tainted in desire!</li>
  <li>About him, fairies; sing a scornful rhyme;</li>
  <li>And, as you trip, still pinch him to your time.</li>
  <li class="subhead">SONG.</li>
  <li>Fie on sinful fantasy!</li>
  <li>Fie on lust and luxury!</li>
  <li class="number">Lust is but a bloody fire,</li>
  <li>Kindled with unchaste desire,</li>
  <li>Fed in heart, whose flames aspire</li>
  <li>As thoughts do blow them, higher and higher.</li>
  <li>Pinch him, fairies, mutually;</li>
  <li class="number">Pinch him for his villany;</li>
  <li>Pinch him, and burn him, and turn him about,</li>
  <li>Till candles and starlight and moonshine be out.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">During this song they pinch FALSTAFF. DOCTOR CAIUS
comes one way, and steals away a boy in green;
SLENDER another way, and takes off a boy in white;
and FENTON comes and steals away ANN PAGE.
A noise of hunting is heard within. All the
Fairies run away. FALSTAFF pulls off his buck’s
head, and rises</div>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter PAGE, FORD, MISTRESS PAGE, and MISTRESS FORD</div>

<ol data-speaker="PAGE">
  <li>Nay, do not fly; I think we have watch’d you now</li>
  <li>Will none but Herne the hunter serve your turn?</li>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS PAGE">
  <li class="number">I pray you, come, hold up the jest no higher</li>
  <li>Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?</li>
  <li>See you these, husband? do not these fair yokes</li>
  <li>Become the forest better than the town?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD">
  <li>Now, sir, who’s a cuckold now? Master Brook,</li>
  <li class="number">Falstaff’s a knave, a cuckoldly knave; here are his</li>
  <li>horns, Master Brook: and, Master Brook, he hath</li>
  <li>enjoyed nothing of Ford’s but his buck-basket, his</li>
  <li>cudgel, and twenty pounds of money, which must be</li>
  <li>paid to Master Brook; his horses are arrested for</li>
  <li class="number">it, Master Brook.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS FORD">
  <li>Sir John, we have had ill luck; we could never meet.</li>
  <li>I will never take you for my love again; but I will</li>
  <li>always count you my deer.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD">
  <li class="number">Ay, and an ox too: both the proofs are extant.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>And these are not fairies? I was three or four</li>
  <li>times in the thought they were not fairies: and yet</li>
  <li>the guiltiness of my mind, the sudden surprise of my</li>
  <li>powers, drove the grossness of the foppery into a</li>
  <li class="number">received belief, in despite of the teeth of all</li>
  <li>rhyme and reason, that they were fairies. See now</li>
  <li>how wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent, when ’tis upon</li>
  <li>ill employment!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR HUGH EVANS">
  <li>Sir John Falstaff, serve Got, and leave your</li>

<ol data-speaker="FORD">
  <li>Well said, fairy Hugh.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR HUGH EVANS">
  <li>And leave your jealousies too, I pray you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD">
  <li>I will never mistrust my wife again till thou art</li>
  <li>able to woo her in good English.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li class="number">Have I laid my brain in the sun and dried it, that</li>
  <li>it wants matter to prevent so gross o’erreaching as</li>

<ol data-speaker="SIR HUGH EVANS">
  <li class="number">Seese is not good to give putter; your belly is all putter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>’Seese’ and ’putter’! have I lived to stand at the</li>

  <li>through the realm.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS PAGE">
  <li class="number">Why Sir John, do you think, though we would have the</li>
  <li>virtue out of our hearts by the head and shoulders</li>
  <li>and have given ourselves without scruple to hell,</li>
  <li>that ever the devil could have made you our delight?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FORD">
  <li>What, a hodge-pudding? a bag of flax?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS PAGE">
  <li class="number">A puffed man?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAGE">
  <li>Old, cold, withered and of intolerable entrails?</li>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Well, I am your theme: you have the start of me; I</li>

  <li>Marry, sir, we’ll bring you to Windsor, to one</li>

  <li>I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne Page,</li>

  <li>The offence is holy that she hath committed;</li>
  <li>And this deceit loses the name of craft,</li>
