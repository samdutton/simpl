<section class="scene">

<h3>SCENE I.  Padua. A public place.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter LUCENTIO and his man TRANIO</div>

<ol data-speaker="LUCENTIO">
  <li>Tranio, since for the great desire I had</li>
  <li>To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,</li>
  <li>I am arrived for fruitful Lombardy,</li>
  <li>The pleasant garden of great Italy;</li>
  <li class="number">And by my father’s love and leave am arm’d</li>
  <li>With his good will and thy good company,</li>
  <li>My trusty servant, well approved in all,</li>
  <li>Here let us breathe and haply institute</li>
  <li>A course of learning and ingenious studies.</li>
  <li class="number">Pisa renown’d for grave citizens</li>
  <li>Gave me my being and my father first,</li>
  <li>A merchant of great traffic through the world,</li>
  <li>Vincetino come of Bentivolii.</li>
  <li>Vincetino’s son brought up in Florence</li>
  <li class="number">It shall become to serve all hopes conceived,</li>
  <li>To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds:</li>
  <li>And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,</li>
  <li>Virtue and that part of philosophy</li>
  <li>Will I apply that treats of happiness</li>
  <li class="number">By virtue specially to be achieved.</li>
  <li>Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left</li>
  <li>And am to Padua come, as he that leaves</li>
  <li>A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep</li>
  <li>And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li class="number">Mi perdonato, gentle master mine,</li>
  <li>I am in all affected as yourself;</li>
  <li>Glad that you thus continue your resolve</li>
  <li>To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.</li>
  <li>Only, good master, while we do admire</li>
  <li class="number">This virtue and this moral discipline,</li>
  <li>Let’s be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray;</li>
  <li>Or so devote to Aristotle’s cheques</li>
  <li>As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured:</li>
  <li>Balk logic with acquaintance that you have</li>
  <li class="number">And practise rhetoric in your common talk;</li>
  <li>Music and poesy use to quicken you;</li>
  <li>The mathematics and the metaphysics,</li>
  <li>Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you;</li>
  <li>No profit grows where is no pleasure ta’en:</li>
  <li class="number">In brief, sir, study what you most affect.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCENTIO">
  <li>Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.</li>
  <li>If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,</li>
  <li>We could at once put us in readiness,</li>
  <li>And take a lodging fit to entertain</li>
  <li class="number">Such friends as time in Padua shall beget.</li>
  <li>But stay a while: what company is this?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li>Master, some show to welcome us to town.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter BAPTISTA, KATHARINA, BIANCA, GREMIO, and
HORTENSIO. LUCENTIO and TRANIO stand by</div>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li>Gentlemen, importune me no farther,</li>
  <li>For how I firmly am resolved you know;</li>
  <li class="number">That is, not bestow my youngest daughter</li>
  <li>Before I have a husband for the elder:</li>
  <li>If either of you both love Katharina,</li>
  <li>Because I know you well and love you well,</li>
  <li>Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREMIO">
  <li class="number"><span class="stage-direction">Aside</span>  To cart her rather: she’s too rough for me.</li>
  <li>There, There, Hortensio, will you any wife?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li>I pray you, sir, is it your will</li>
  <li>To make a stale of me amongst these mates?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li>Mates, maid! how mean you that? no mates for you,</li>
  <li class="number">Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li>I’faith, sir, you shall never need to fear:</li>
  <li>I wis it is not half way to her heart;</li>
  <li>But if it were, doubt not her care should be</li>
  <li>To comb your noddle with a three-legg’d stool</li>
  <li class="number">And paint your face and use you like a fool.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIA">
  <li>From all such devils, good Lord deliver us!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREMIO">
  <li>And me too, good Lord!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li>Hush, master! here’s some good pastime toward:</li>
  <li>That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCENTIO">
  <li class="number">But in the other’s silence do I see</li>
  <li>Maid’s mild behavior and sobriety.</li>
  <li>Peace, Tranio!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li>Well said, master; mum! and gaze your fill.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li>Gentlemen, that I may soon make good</li>
  <li class="number">What I have said, Bianca, get you in:</li>
  <li>And let it not displease thee, good Bianca,</li>
  <li>For I will love thee ne’er the less, my girl.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li>A pretty peat! it is best</li>
  <li>Put finger in the eye, an she knew why.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIANCA">
  <li class="number">Sister, content you in my discontent.</li>
  <li>Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe:</li>
  <li>My books and instruments shall be my company,</li>
  <li>On them to took and practise by myself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCENTIO">
  <li>Hark, Tranio! thou may’st hear Minerva speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li class="number">Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?</li>
  <li>Sorry am I that our good will effects</li>
  <li>Bianca’s grief.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREMIO">
  <li>Why will you mew her up,</li>
  <li>Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,</li>
  <li class="number">And make her bear the penance of her tongue?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li>Gentlemen, content ye; I am resolved:</li>
  <li>Go in, Bianca:</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exit BIANCA</li>
  <li>And for I know she taketh most delight</li>
  <li>In music, instruments and poetry,</li>
  <li class="number">Schoolmasters will I keep within my house,</li>
  <li>Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,</li>
  <li>Or Signior Gremio, you, know any such,</li>
  <li>Prefer them hither; for to cunning men</li>
  <li>I will be very kind, and liberal</li>
  <li class="number">To mine own children in good bringing up:</li>
  <li>And so farewell. Katharina, you may stay;</li>
  <li>For I have more to commune with Bianca.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li>Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not? What,</li>
  <li>shall I be appointed hours; as though, belike, I</li>
  <li class="number">knew not what to take and what to leave, ha?</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<ol data-speaker="GREMIO">
  <li>You may go to the devil’s dam: your gifts are so</li>
  <li>good, here’s none will hold you. Their love is not</li>
  <li>so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our nails</li>
  <li>together, and fast it fairly out: our cakes dough on</li>
  <li class="number">both sides. Farewell: yet for the love I bear my</li>
  <li>sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit</li>
  <li>man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will</li>
  <li>wish him to her father.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li>So will I, Signior Gremio: but a word, I pray.</li>
  <li class="number">Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked</li>
  <li>parle, know now, upon advice, it toucheth us both,</li>
  <li>that we may yet again have access to our fair</li>
  <li>mistress and be happy rivals in Bianco’s love, to</li>
  <li>labour and effect one thing specially.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREMIO">
  <li class="number">What’s that, I pray?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li>Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREMIO">
  <li>A husband! a devil.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li>I say, a husband.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREMIO">
  <li>I say, a devil. Thinkest thou, Hortensio, though</li>
  <li class="number">her father be very rich, any man is so very a fool</li>
  <li>to be married to hell?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li>Tush, Gremio, though it pass your patience and mine</li>
  <li>to endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good</li>
  <li>fellows in the world, an a man could light on them,</li>
  <li class="number">would take her with all faults, and money enough.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREMIO">
  <li>I cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with</li>
  <li>this condition, to be whipped at the high cross</li>
  <li>every morning.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li>Faith, as you say, there’s small choice in rotten</li>
  <li class="number">apples. But come; since this bar in law makes us</li>
  <li>friends, it shall be so far forth friendly</li>
  <li>maintained all by helping Baptista’s eldest daughter</li>
  <li>to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband,</li>
  <li>and then have to’t a fresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man</li>
  <li class="number">be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring.</li>
  <li>How say you, Signior Gremio?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREMIO">
  <li>I am agreed; and would I had given him the best</li>
  <li>horse in Padua to begin his wooing that would</li>
  <li>thoroughly woo her, wed her and bed her and rid the</li>
  <li class="number">house of her! Come on.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt GREMIO and HORTENSIO</div>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li>I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible</li>
  <li>That love should of a sudden take such hold?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCENTIO">
  <li>O Tranio, till I found it to be true,</li>
  <li>I never thought it possible or likely;</li>
  <li class="number">But see, while idly I stood looking on,</li>
  <li>I found the effect of love in idleness:</li>
  <li>And now in plainness do confess to thee,</li>
  <li>That art to me as secret and as dear</li>
  <li>As Anna to the queen of Carthage was,</li>
  <li class="number">Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,</li>
  <li>If I achieve not this young modest girl.</li>
  <li>Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst;</li>
  <li>Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li>Master, it is no time to chide you now;</li>
  <li class="number">Affection is not rated from the heart:</li>
  <li>If love have touch’d you, nought remains but so,</li>
  <li>’Redime te captum quam queas minimo.’</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCENTIO">
  <li>Gramercies, lad, go forward; this contents:</li>
  <li>The rest will comfort, for thy counsel’s sound.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li class="number">Master, you look’d so longly on the maid,</li>
  <li>Perhaps you mark’d not what’s the pith of all.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCENTIO">
  <li>O yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,</li>
  <li>Such as the daughter of Agenor had,</li>
  <li>That made great Jove to humble him to her hand.</li>
  <li class="number">When with his knees he kiss’d the Cretan strand.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li>Saw you no more? mark’d you not how her sister</li>
  <li>Began to scold and raise up such a storm</li>
  <li>That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCENTIO">
  <li>Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move</li>
  <li class="number">And with her breath she did perfume the air:</li>
  <li>Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li>Nay, then, ’tis time to stir him from his trance.</li>
  <li>I pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid,</li>
  <li>Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:</li>
  <li class="number">Her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd</li>
  <li>That till the father rid his hands of her,</li>
  <li>Master, your love must live a maid at home;</li>
  <li>And therefore has he closely mew’d her up,</li>
  <li>Because she will not be annoy’d with suitors.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCENTIO">
  <li class="number">Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father’s he!</li>
  <li>But art thou not advised, he took some care</li>
  <li>To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li>Ay, marry, am I, sir; and now ’tis plotted.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCENTIO">
  <li>I have it, Tranio.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li class="number">Master, for my hand,</li>
  <li>Both our inventions meet and jump in one.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCENTIO">
  <li>Tell me thine first.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li>You will be schoolmaster</li>
  <li>And undertake the teaching of the maid:</li>
  <li class="number">That’s your device.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCENTIO">
  <li>It is: may it be done?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li>Not possible; for who shall bear your part,</li>
  <li>And be in Padua here Vincentio’s son,</li>
  <li>Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,</li>
  <li class="number">Visit his countrymen and banquet them?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCENTIO">
  <li>Basta; content thee, for I have it full.</li>
  <li>We have not yet been seen in any house,</li>
  <li>Nor can we lie distinguish’d by our faces</li>
  <li>For man or master; then it follows thus;</li>
  <li class="number">Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,</li>
  <li>Keep house and port and servants as I should:</li>
  <li>I will some other be, some Florentine,</li>
  <li>Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.</li>
  <li>’Tis hatch’d and shall be so: Tranio, at once</li>
  <li class="number">Uncase thee; take my colour’d hat and cloak:</li>
  <li>When Biondello comes, he waits on thee;</li>
  <li>But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li>So had you need.</li>
  <li>In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,</li>
  <li class="number">And I am tied to be obedient;</li>
  <li>For so your father charged me at our parting,</li>
  <li>’Be serviceable to my son,’ quoth he,</li>
  <li>Although I think ’twas in another sense;</li>
  <li>I am content to be Lucentio,</li>
  <li class="number">Because so well I love Lucentio.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCENTIO">
  <li>Tranio, be so, because Lucentio loves:</li>
  <li>And let me be a slave, to achieve that maid</li>
  <li>Whose sudden sight hath thrall’d my wounded eye.</li>
  <li>Here comes the rogue.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter BIONDELLO</li>
  <li class="number">Sirrah, where have you been?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIONDELLO">
  <li>Where have I been! Nay, how now! where are you?</li>
  <li>Master, has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes? Or</li>
  <li>you stolen his? or both? pray, what’s the news?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCENTIO">
  <li>Sirrah, come hither: ’tis no time to jest,</li>
  <li class="number">And therefore frame your manners to the time.</li>
  <li>Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life,</li>
  <li>Puts my apparel and my countenance on,</li>
  <li>And I for my escape have put on his;</li>
  <li>For in a quarrel since I came ashore</li>
  <li class="number">I kill’d a man and fear I was descried:</li>
  <li>Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,</li>
  <li>While I make way from hence to save my life:</li>
  <li>You understand me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIONDELLO">
  <li>I, sir! ne’er a whit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCENTIO">
  <li class="number">And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:</li>
  <li>Tranio is changed into Lucentio.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIONDELLO">
  <li>The better for him: would I were so too!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li>So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,</li>
  <li>That Lucentio indeed had Baptista’s youngest daughter.</li>
  <li class="number">But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master’s, I advise</li>
  <li>You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:</li>
  <li>When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;</li>
  <li>But in all places else your master Lucentio.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCENTIO">
  <li>Tranio, let’s go: one thing more rests, that</li>
  <li class="number">thyself execute, to make one among these wooers: if</li>
  <li>thou ask me why, sufficeth, my reasons are both good</li>
  <li>and weighty.</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  Padua. Before HORTENSIO’S house.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter PETRUCHIO and his man GRUMIO</div>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Verona, for a while I take my leave,</li>
  <li>To see my friends in Padua, but of all</li>
  <li>My best beloved and approved friend,</li>
  <li>Hortensio; and I trow this is his house.</li>
  <li class="number">Here, sirrah Grumio; knock, I say.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRUMIO">
  <li>Knock, sir! whom should I knock? is there man has</li>
  <li>rebused your worship?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRUMIO">
  <li>Knock you here, sir! why, sir, what am I, sir, that</li>
  <li class="number">I should knock you here, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Villain, I say, knock me at this gate</li>
  <li>And rap me well, or I’ll knock your knave’s pate.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRUMIO">
  <li>My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock</li>
  <li>you first,</li>
  <li class="number">And then I know after who comes by the worst.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Will it not be?</li>
  <li>Faith, sirrah, an you’ll not knock, I’ll ring it;</li>
  <li>I’ll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">He wrings him by the ears</div>

<ol data-speaker="GRUMIO">
  <li>Help, masters, help! my master is mad.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li class="number">Now, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter HORTENSIO</div>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li>How now! what’s the matter? My old friend Grumio!</li>
  <li>and my good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?</li>
  <li>’Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato,’ may I say.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li class="number">’Alla nostra casa ben venuto, molto honorato signor</li>
  <li>mio Petruchio.’ Rise, Grumio, rise: we will compound</li>
  <li>this quarrel.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRUMIO">
  <li>Nay, ’tis no matter, sir, what he ’leges in Latin.</li>
  <li>if this be not a lawful case for me to leave his</li>
  <li class="number">service, look you, sir, he bid me knock him and rap</li>
  <li>him soundly, sir: well, was it fit for a servant to</li>
  <li>use his master so, being perhaps, for aught I see,</li>
  <li>two and thirty, a pip out? Whom would to God I had</li>
  <li>well knock’d at first, Then had not Grumio come by the worst.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li class="number">A senseless villain! Good Hortensio,</li>
  <li>I bade the rascal knock upon your gate</li>
  <li>And could not get him for my heart to do it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRUMIO">
  <li>Knock at the gate! O heavens! Spake you not these</li>
  <li>words plain, ’Sirrah, knock me here, rap me here,</li>
  <li class="number">knock me well, and knock me soundly’? And come you</li>
  <li>now with, ’knocking at the gate’?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li>Petruchio, patience; I am Grumio’s pledge:</li>
  <li>Why, this’s a heavy chance ’twixt him and you,</li>
  <li class="number">Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.</li>
  <li>And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale</li>
  <li>Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Such wind as scatters young men through the world,</li>
  <li>To seek their fortunes farther than at home</li>
  <li class="number">Where small experience grows. But in a few,</li>
  <li>Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:</li>
  <li>Antonio, my father, is deceased;</li>
  <li>And I have thrust myself into this maze,</li>
  <li>Haply to wive and thrive as best I may:</li>
  <li class="number">Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,</li>
  <li>And so am come abroad to see the world.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li>Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee</li>
  <li>And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour’d wife?</li>
  <li>Thou’ldst thank me but a little for my counsel:</li>
  <li class="number">And yet I’ll promise thee she shall be rich</li>
  <li>And very rich: but thou’rt too much my friend,</li>
  <li>And I’ll not wish thee to her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Signior Hortensio, ’twixt such friends as we</li>
  <li>Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know</li>
  <li class="number">One rich enough to be Petruchio’s wife,</li>
  <li>As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,</li>
  <li>Be she as foul as was Florentius’ love,</li>
  <li>As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewd</li>
  <li>As Socrates’ Xanthippe, or a worse,</li>
  <li class="number">She moves me not, or not removes, at least,</li>
  <li>Affection’s edge in me, were she as rough</li>
  <li>As are the swelling Adriatic seas:</li>
  <li>I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;</li>
  <li>If wealthily, then happily in Padua.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRUMIO">
  <li class="number">Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his</li>
  <li>mind is: Why give him gold enough and marry him to</li>
  <li>a puppet or an aglet-baby; or an old trot with ne’er</li>
  <li>a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases</li>
  <li>as two and fifty horses: why, nothing comes amiss,</li>
  <li class="number">so money comes withal.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li>Petruchio, since we are stepp’d thus far in,</li>
  <li>I will continue that I broach’d in jest.</li>
  <li>I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife</li>
  <li>With wealth enough and young and beauteous,</li>
  <li class="number">Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman:</li>
  <li>Her only fault, and that is faults enough,</li>
  <li>Is that she is intolerable curst</li>
  <li>And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure</li>
  <li>That, were my state far worser than it is,</li>
  <li class="number">I would not wed her for a mine of gold.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Hortensio, peace! thou know’st not gold’s effect:</li>
  <li>Tell me her father’s name and ’tis enough;</li>
  <li>For I will board her, though she chide as loud</li>
  <li>As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li class="number">Her father is Baptista Minola,</li>
  <li>An affable and courteous gentleman:</li>
  <li>Her name is Katharina Minola,</li>
  <li>Renown’d in Padua for her scolding tongue.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>I know her father, though I know not her;</li>
  <li class="number">And he knew my deceased father well.</li>
  <li>I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;</li>
  <li>And therefore let me be thus bold with you</li>
  <li>To give you over at this first encounter,</li>
  <li>Unless you will accompany me thither.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRUMIO">
  <li class="number">I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts.</li>
  <li>O’ my word, an she knew him as well as I do, she</li>
  <li>would think scolding would do little good upon him:</li>
  <li>she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so:</li>
  <li>why, that’s nothing; an he begin once, he’ll rail in</li>
  <li class="number">his rope-tricks. I’ll tell you what sir, an she</li>
  <li>stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in</li>
  <li>her face and so disfigure her with it that she</li>
  <li>shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat.</li>
  <li>You know him not, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li class="number">Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,</li>
  <li>For in Baptista’s keep my treasure is:</li>
  <li>He hath the jewel of my life in hold,</li>
  <li>His youngest daughter, beautiful Binaca,</li>
  <li>And her withholds from me and other more,</li>
  <li class="number">Suitors to her and rivals in my love,</li>
  <li>Supposing it a thing impossible,</li>
  <li>For those defects I have before rehearsed,</li>
  <li>That ever Katharina will be woo’d;</li>
  <li>Therefore this order hath Baptista ta’en,</li>
  <li class="number">That none shall have access unto Bianca</li>
  <li>Till Katharina the curst have got a husband.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRUMIO">
  <li>Katharina the curst!</li>
  <li>A title for a maid of all titles the worst.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li>Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,</li>
  <li class="number">And offer me disguised in sober robes</li>
  <li>To old Baptista as a schoolmaster</li>
  <li>Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca;</li>
  <li>That so I may, by this device, at least</li>
  <li>Have leave and leisure to make love to her</li>
  <li class="number">And unsuspected court her by herself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRUMIO">
  <li>Here’s no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks,</li>
  <li>how the young folks lay their heads together!</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter GREMIO, and LUCENTIO disguised</li>
  <li>Master, master, look about you: who goes there, ha?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li>Peace, Grumio! it is the rival of my love.</li>
  <li class="number">Petruchio, stand by a while.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRUMIO">
  <li>A proper stripling and an amorous!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREMIO">
  <li>O, very well; I have perused the note.</li>
  <li>Hark you, sir: I’ll have them very fairly bound:</li>
  <li>All books of love, see that at any hand;</li>
  <li class="number">And see you read no other lectures to her:</li>
  <li>You understand me: over and beside</li>
  <li>Signior Baptista’s liberality,</li>
  <li>I’ll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too,</li>
  <li>And let me have them very well perfumed</li>
  <li class="number">For she is sweeter than perfume itself</li>
  <li>To whom they go to. What will you read to her?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCENTIO">
  <li>Whate’er I read to her, I’ll plead for you</li>
  <li>As for my patron, stand you so assured,</li>
  <li>As firmly as yourself were still in place:</li>
  <li class="number">Yea, and perhaps with more successful words</li>
  <li>Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREMIO">
  <li>O this learning, what a thing it is!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRUMIO">
  <li>O this woodcock, what an ass it is!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Peace, sirrah!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li class="number">Grumio, mum! God save you, Signior Gremio.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREMIO">
  <li>And you are well met, Signior Hortensio.</li>
  <li>Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.</li>
  <li>I promised to inquire carefully</li>
  <li>About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca:</li>
  <li class="number">And by good fortune I have lighted well</li>
  <li>On this young man, for learning and behavior</li>
  <li>Fit for her turn, well read in poetry</li>
  <li>And other books, good ones, I warrant ye.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li>’Tis well; and I have met a gentleman</li>
  <li class="number">Hath promised me to help me to another,</li>
  <li>A fine musician to instruct our mistress;</li>
  <li>So shall I no whit be behind in duty</li>
  <li>To fair Bianca, so beloved of me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREMIO">
  <li>Beloved of me; and that my deeds shall prove.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRUMIO">
  <li class="number">And that his bags shall prove.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li>Gremio, ’tis now no time to vent our love:</li>
  <li>Listen to me, and if you speak me fair,</li>
  <li>I’ll tell you news indifferent good for either.</li>
  <li>Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,</li>
  <li class="number">Upon agreement from us to his liking,</li>
  <li>Will undertake to woo curst Katharina,</li>
  <li>Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREMIO">
  <li>So said, so done, is well.</li>
  <li>Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li class="number">I know she is an irksome brawling scold:</li>
  <li>If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREMIO">
  <li>No, say’st me so, friend? What countryman?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Born in Verona, old Antonio’s son:</li>
  <li>My father dead, my fortune lives for me;</li>
  <li class="number">And I do hope good days and long to see.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREMIO">
  <li>O sir, such a life, with such a wife, were strange!</li>
  <li>But if you have a stomach, to’t i’ God’s name:</li>
  <li>You shall have me assisting you in all.</li>
  <li>But will you woo this wild-cat?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li class="number">Will I live?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRUMIO">
  <li>Will he woo her? ay, or I’ll hang her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Why came I hither but to that intent?</li>
  <li>Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?</li>
  <li>Have I not in my time heard lions roar?</li>
  <li class="number">Have I not heard the sea puff’d up with winds</li>
  <li>Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?</li>
  <li>Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,</li>
  <li>And heaven’s artillery thunder in the skies?</li>
  <li>Have I not in a pitched battle heard</li>
  <li class="number">Loud ’larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets’ clang?</li>
  <li>And do you tell me of a woman’s tongue,</li>
  <li>That gives not half so great a blow to hear</li>
  <li>As will a chestnut in a farmer’s fire?</li>
  <li>Tush, tush! fear boys with bugs.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRUMIO">
  <li class="number">For he fears none.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREMIO">
  <li>Hortensio, hark:</li>
  <li>This gentleman is happily arrived,</li>
  <li>My mind presumes, for his own good and ours.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li>I promised we would be contributors</li>
  <li class="number">And bear his charging of wooing, whatsoe’er.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREMIO">
  <li>And so we will, provided that he win her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRUMIO">
  <li>I would I were as sure of a good dinner.</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter TRANIO brave, and BIONDELLO</div>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li>Gentlemen, God save you. If I may be bold,</li>

  <li>Hark you, sir; you mean not her to — </li>

  <li>Perhaps, him and her, sir: what have you to do?</li>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li class="number">Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.</li>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li>Sir, a word ere you go;</li>
  <li>Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li class="number">And if I be, sir, is it any offence?</li>

<ol data-speaker="GREMIO">
  <li>No; if without more words you will get you hence.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li>Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free</li>
  <li>For me as for you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREMIO">
  <li>But so is not she.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li class="number">For what reason, I beseech you?</li>

<ol data-speaker="GREMIO">
  <li>For this reason, if you’ll know,</li>
  <li>That she’s the choice love of Signior Gremio.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li>That she’s the chosen of Signior Hortensio.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li>Softly, my masters! if you be gentlemen,</li>
  <li class="number">Do me this right; hear me with patience.</li>
  <li>Baptista is a noble gentleman,</li>
  <li>To whom my father is not all unknown;</li>
  <li>And were his daughter fairer than she is,</li>
  <li>She may more suitors have and me for one.</li>
  <li class="number">Fair Leda’s daughter had a thousand wooers;</li>
  <li>Then well one more may fair Bianca have:</li>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Hortensio, to what end are all these words?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li>Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,</li>
  <li>Did you yet ever see Baptista’s daughter?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li>No, sir; but hear I do that he hath two,</li>
  <li class="number">The one as famous for a scolding tongue</li>
  <li>As is the other for beauteous modesty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Sir, sir, the first’s for me; let her go by.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREMIO">
  <li>Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules;</li>
  <li>And let it be more than Alcides’ twelve.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li class="number">Sir, understand you this of me in sooth:</li>
  <li>The youngest daughter whom you hearken for</li>
  <li>Her father keeps from all access of suitors,</li>
  <li>And will not promise her to any man</li>
  <li>Until the elder sister first be wed:</li>
  <li class="number">The younger then is free and not before.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li>If it be so, sir, that you are the man</li>
  <li>Must stead us all and me amongst the rest,</li>
  <li>And if you break the ice and do this feat,</li>
  <li>Achieve the elder, set the younger free</li>
  <li class="number">For our access, whose hap shall be to have her</li>
  <li>Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li>Sir, you say well and well you do conceive;</li>
  <li>And since you do profess to be a suitor,</li>
  <li>You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,</li>
  <li class="number">To whom we all rest generally beholding.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li>Sir, I shall not be slack: in sign whereof,</li>
  <li>Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,</li>
  <li>And quaff carouses to our mistress’ health,</li>
  <li>And do as adversaries do in law,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREMIO">
  <li>I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your</li>
  <li>wooing. Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am</li>
  <li>sure of it. To express the like kindness, myself,</li>
  <li>that have been more kindly beholding to you than</li>
  <li class="number">any, freely give unto you this young scholar,</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Presenting LUCENTIO</li>
  <li>that hath been long studying at Rheims; as cunning</li>
  <li>in Greek, Latin, and other languages, as the other</li>
  <li>in music and mathematics: his name is Cambio; pray,</li>
  <li>accept his service.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li class="number">A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio.</li>
  <li>Welcome, good Cambio.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">To TRANIO</li>
  <li>But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger:</li>
  <li>may I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li>Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,</li>
  <li class="number">That, being a stranger in this city here,</li>
  <li>Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,</li>
  <li>Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.</li>
  <li>Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,</li>
  <li>In the preferment of the eldest sister.</li>
  <li class="number">This liberty is all that I request,</li>
  <li>That, upon knowledge of my parentage,</li>
  <li>I may have welcome ’mongst the rest that woo</li>
  <li>And free access and favour as the rest:</li>
  <li>And, toward the education of your daughters,</li>
  <li class="number">I here bestow a simple instrument,</li>
  <li>And this small packet of Greek and Latin books:</li>
  <li>If you accept them, then their worth is great.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li>Lucentio is your name; of whence, I pray?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li>Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li class="number">A mighty man of Pisa; by report</li>
  <li>I know him well: you are very welcome, sir,</li>
  <li>Take you the lute, and you the set of books;</li>
  <li>You shall go see your pupils presently.</li>
  <li>Holla, within!</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter a Servant</li>
  <li class="number">Sirrah, lead these gentlemen</li>
  <li>To my daughters; and tell them both,</li>
  <li>These are their tutors: bid them use them well.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exit Servant, with LUCENTIO and HORTENSIO,
BIONDELLO following</li>
  <li>We will go walk a little in the orchard,</li>
  <li>And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,</li>
  <li class="number">And so I pray you all to think yourselves.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,</li>
  <li>And every day I cannot come to woo.</li>
  <li>You knew my father well, and in him me,</li>
  <li>Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,</li>
  <li class="number">Which I have better’d rather than decreased:</li>
  <li>Then tell me, if I get your daughter’s love,</li>
  <li>What dowry shall I have with her to wife?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li>After my death the one half of my lands,</li>
  <li>And in possession twenty thousand crowns.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li class="number">And, for that dowry, I’ll assure her of</li>
  <li>Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,</li>
  <li>In all my lands and leases whatsoever:</li>
  <li>Let specialties be therefore drawn between us,</li>
  <li>That covenants may be kept on either hand.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li class="number">Ay, when the special thing is well obtain’d,</li>
  <li>That is, her love; for that is all in all.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Why, that is nothing: for I tell you, father,</li>
  <li>I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;</li>
  <li>And where two raging fires meet together</li>
  <li class="number">They do consume the thing that feeds their fury:</li>
  <li>Though little fire grows great with little wind,</li>
  <li>Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all:</li>
  <li>So I to her and so she yields to me;</li>
  <li>For I am rough and woo not like a babe.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li class="number">Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed!</li>
  <li>But be thou arm’d for some unhappy words.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Ay, to the proof; as mountains are for winds,</li>
  <li>That shake not, though they blow perpetually.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Re-enter HORTENSIO, with his head broke</div>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li>How now, my friend! why dost thou look so pale?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li class="number">For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li>What, will my daughter prove a good musician?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li>I think she’ll sooner prove a soldier</li>
  <li>Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li>Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li class="number">Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.</li>
  <li>I did but tell her she mistook her frets,</li>
  <li>And bow’d her hand to teach her fingering;</li>
  <li>When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,</li>
  <li>’Frets, call you these?’ quoth she; ’I’ll fume</li>
  <li class="number">with them:’</li>
  <li>And, with that word, she struck me on the head,</li>
  <li>And through the instrument my pate made way;</li>
  <li>And there I stood amazed for a while,</li>
  <li>As on a pillory, looking through the lute;</li>
  <li class="number">While she did call me rascal fiddler</li>
  <li>And twangling Jack; with twenty such vile terms,</li>
  <li>As had she studied to misuse me so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench;</li>
  <li>I love her ten times more than e’er I did:</li>
  <li class="number">O, how I long to have some chat with her!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li>Well, go with me and be not so discomfited:</li>
  <li>Proceed in practise with my younger daughter;</li>
  <li>She’s apt to learn and thankful for good turns.</li>
  <li>Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,</li>
  <li class="number">Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>I pray you do.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exeunt all but PETRUCHIO</li>
  <li>I will attend her here,</li>
  <li>And woo her with some spirit when she comes.</li>
  <li>Say that she rail; why then I’ll tell her plain</li>
  <li class="number">She sings as sweetly as a nightingale:</li>
  <li>Say that she frown, I’ll say she looks as clear</li>
  <li>As morning roses newly wash’d with dew:</li>
  <li>Say she be mute and will not speak a word;</li>
  <li>Then I’ll commend her volubility,</li>
  <li class="number">And say she uttereth piercing eloquence:</li>
  <li>If she do bid me pack, I’ll give her thanks,</li>
  <li>As though she bid me stay by her a week:</li>
  <li>If she deny to wed, I’ll crave the day</li>
  <li>When I shall ask the banns and when be married.</li>
  <li class="number">But here she comes; and now, Petruchio, speak.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter KATHARINA</li>
  <li>Good morrow, Kate; for that’s your name, I hear.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li>Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing:</li>
  <li>They call me Katharina that do talk of me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>You lie, in faith; for you are call’d plain Kate,</li>
  <li class="number">And bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst;</li>
  <li>But Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom</li>
  <li>Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,</li>
  <li>For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate,</li>
  <li>Take this of me, Kate of my consolation;</li>
  <li class="number">Hearing thy mildness praised in every town,</li>
  <li>Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,</li>
  <li>Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,</li>
  <li>Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li>Moved! in good time: let him that moved you hither</li>
  <li class="number">Remove you hence: I knew you at the first</li>
  <li>You were a moveable.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Why, what’s a moveable?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li>A join’d-stool.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Thou hast hit it: come, sit on me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li class="number">Asses are made to bear, and so are you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Women are made to bear, and so are you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li>No such jade as you, if me you mean.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Alas! good Kate, I will not burden thee;</li>
  <li>For, knowing thee to be but young and light — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li class="number">Too light for such a swain as you to catch;</li>
  <li>And yet as heavy as my weight should be.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Should be! should — buzz!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li>Well ta’en, and like a buzzard.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>O slow-wing’d turtle! shall a buzzard take thee?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li class="number">Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Come, come, you wasp; i’ faith, you are too angry.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li>If I be waspish, best beware my sting.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>My remedy is then, to pluck it out.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li>Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies,</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li class="number">Who knows not where a wasp does</li>
  <li>wear his sting? In his tail.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li>In his tongue.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Whose tongue?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li>Yours, if you talk of tails: and so farewell.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li class="number">What, with my tongue in your tail? nay, come again,</li>
  <li>Good Kate; I am a gentleman.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li>That I’ll try.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">She strikes him</div>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>I swear I’ll cuff you, if you strike again.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li>So may you lose your arms:</li>
  <li class="number">If you strike me, you are no gentleman;</li>
  <li>And if no gentleman, why then no arms.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li>What is your crest? a coxcomb?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li class="number">No cock of mine; you crow too like a craven.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so sour.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li>It is my fashion, when I see a crab.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Why, here’s no crab; and therefore look not sour.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li>There is, there is.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li class="number">Then show it me.</li>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li>Had I a glass, I would.</li>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>What, you mean my face?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li>Well aim’d of such a young one.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li class="number">Yet you are wither’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li>I care not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Nay, hear you, Kate: in sooth you scape not so.</li>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li>I chafe you, if I tarry: let me go.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li class="number">No, not a whit: I find you passing gentle.</li>
  <li>’Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen,</li>
  <li>And now I find report a very liar;</li>
  <li>For thou are pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,</li>
  <li>But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers:</li>
  <li class="number">Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,</li>
  <li>Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,</li>
  <li>Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk,</li>
  <li>But thou with mildness entertain’st thy wooers,</li>
  <li>With gentle conference, soft and affable.</li>
  <li class="number">Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?</li>
  <li>O slanderous world! Kate like the hazel-twig</li>
  <li>Is straight and slender and as brown in hue</li>
  <li>As hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels.</li>
  <li>O, let me see thee walk: thou dost not halt.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li class="number">Go, fool, and whom thou keep’st command.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Did ever Dian so become a grove</li>
  <li>As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?</li>
  <li>O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate;</li>
  <li>And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li class="number">Where did you study all this goodly speech?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>It is extempore, from my mother-wit.</li>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Am I not wise?</li>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li>Yes; keep you warm.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li class="number">Marry, so I mean, sweet Katharina, in thy bed:</li>
  <li>And therefore, setting all this chat aside,</li>
  <li>Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented</li>
  <li>That you shall be my wife; your dowry ’greed on;</li>
  <li>And, Will you, nill you, I will marry you.</li>
  <li class="number">Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;</li>
  <li>For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,</li>
  <li>Thy beauty, that doth make me like thee well,</li>
  <li>Thou must be married to no man but me;</li>
  <li>For I am he am born to tame you Kate,</li>
  <li class="number">And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate</li>
  <li>Conformable as other household Kates.</li>

  <li>Valance of Venice gold in needlework,</li>

  <li>What, have I choked you with an argosy?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">

  <li>Why, then the maid is mine from all the world,</li>
  <li class="number">By your firm promise: Gremio is out-vied.</li>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li>I must confess your offer is the best;</li>
  <li>And, let your father make her the assurance,</li>
  <li>She is your own; else, you must pardon me,</li>
  <li>if you should die before him, where’s her dower?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li class="number">That’s but a cavil: he is old, I young.</li>

<ol data-speaker="GREMIO">
  <li>And may not young men die, as well as old?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li>Well, gentlemen,</li>
  <li>I am thus resolved: on Sunday next you know</li>
  <li>My daughter Katharina is to be married:</li>
  <li class="number">Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca</li>
  <li>Be bride to you, if you this assurance;</li>
  <li>If not, Signior Gremio:</li>
  <li>And so, I take my leave, and thank you both.</li>

  <li>Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool</li>
  <li>To give thee all, and in his waning age</li>

  <li>An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter LUCENTIO, HORTENSIO, and BIANCA</div>

<ol data-speaker="LUCENTIO">
  <li>Fiddler, forbear; you grow too forward, sir:</li>
  <li>Have you so soon forgot the entertainment</li>
  <li>Her sister Katharina welcomed you withal?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li>But, wrangling pedant, this is</li>
  <li class="number">The patroness of heavenly harmony:</li>
  <li>Then give me leave to have prerogative;</li>
  <li>And when in music we have spent an hour,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCENTIO">
  <li>Preposterous ass, that never read so far</li>
  <li class="number">To know the cause why music was ordain’d!</li>
  <li>Was it not to refresh the mind of man</li>
  <li>After his studies or his usual pain?</li>
  <li>Then give me leave to read philosophy,</li>
  <li>And while I pause, serve in your harmony.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li class="number">Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIANCA">
  <li>Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong,</li>
  <li>To strive for that which resteth in my choice:</li>
  <li>I am no breeching scholar in the schools;</li>
  <li>I’ll not be tied to hours nor ’pointed times,</li>
  <li class="number">But learn my lessons as I please myself.</li>
  <li>And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down:</li>
  <li>Take you your instrument, play you the whiles;</li>
  <li>His lecture will be done ere you have tuned.</li>

  <li>You’ll leave his lecture when I am in tune?</li>

  <li>Here, madam:</li>

<ol data-speaker="LUCENTIO">
  <li>’Hic ibat,’ as I told you before, ’Simois,’ I am</li>

  <li>’Sigeia tellus,’ disguised thus to get your love;</li>
  <li>’Hic steterat,’ and that Lucentio that comes</li>
  <li class="number">a-wooing, ’Priami,’ is my man Tranio, ’regia,’</li>
  <li>bearing my port, ’celsa senis,’ that we might</li>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li>Madam, my instrument’s in tune.</li>

  <li>Let’s hear. O fie! the treble jars.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCENTIO">
  <li class="number">Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIANCA">
  <li>Now let me see if I can construe it: ’Hic ibat</li>
  <li>Simois,’ I know you not, ’hic est Sigeia tellus,’ I</li>
  <li>trust you not; ’Hic steterat Priami,’ take heed</li>
  <li>he hear us not, ’regia,’ presume not, ’celsa senis,’</li>
  <li class="number">despair not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li>Madam, ’tis now in tune.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCENTIO">
  <li>All but the base.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li>The base is right; ’tis the base knave that jars.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Aside</li>
  <li>How fiery and forward our pedant is!</li>
  <li class="number">Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love:</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIANCA">
  <li>In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.</li>

<ol data-speaker="BIANCA">
  <li class="number">I must believe my master; else, I promise you,</li>

  <li>That I have been thus pleasant with you both.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li class="number">You may go walk, and give me leave a while:</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li class="number">Madam, before you touch the instrument,</li>
  <li>To learn the order of my fingering,</li>
  <li>I must begin with rudiments of art;</li>
  <li>To teach you gamut in a briefer sort,</li>
  <li>More pleasant, pithy and effectual,</li>
  <li class="number">Than hath been taught by any of my trade:</li>
  <li>And there it is in writing, fairly drawn.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIANCA">
  <li>Why, I am past my gamut long ago.</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  Padua. Before BAPTISTA’S house.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter BAPTISTA, GREMIO, TRANIO, KATHARINA, BIANCA,
LUCENTIO, and others, attendants</div>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li><stagedir>To TRANIO</stagedir>  Signior Lucentio, this is the</li>
  <li>’pointed day.</li>
  <li>That Katharina and Petruchio should be married,</li>
  <li>And yet we hear not of our son-in-law.</li>
  <li class="number">What will be said? what mockery will it be,</li>
  <li>To want the bridegroom when the priest attends</li>
  <li>To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage!</li>
  <li>What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li>No shame but mine: I must, forsooth, be forced</li>
  <li class="number">To give my hand opposed against my heart</li>
  <li>Unto a mad-brain rudesby full of spleen;</li>
  <li>Who woo’d in haste and means to wed at leisure.</li>
  <li>I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,</li>
  <li>Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior:</li>
  <li class="number">And, to be noted for a merry man,</li>
  <li>He’ll woo a thousand, ’point the day of marriage,</li>
  <li>Make feasts, invite friends, and proclaim the banns;</li>
  <li>Yet never means to wed where he hath woo’d.</li>
  <li>Now must the world point at poor Katharina,</li>
  <li class="number">And say, ’Lo, there is mad Petruchio’s wife,</li>
  <li>If it would please him come and marry her!’</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li>Patience, good Katharina, and Baptista too.</li>
  <li>Upon my life, Petruchio means but well,</li>
  <li>Whatever fortune stays him from his word:</li>
  <li class="number">Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise;</li>
  <li>Though he be merry, yet withal he’s honest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li>Would Katharina had never seen him though!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit weeping, followed by BIANCA and others</div>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li>Go, girl; I cannot blame thee now to weep;</li>
  <li>For such an injury would vex a very saint,</li>
  <li class="number">Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter BIONDELLO</div>

<ol data-speaker="BIONDELLO">
  <li>Master, master! news, old news, and such news as</li>
  <li>you never heard of!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li>Is it new and old too? how may that be?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIONDELLO">
  <li>Why, is it not news, to hear of Petruchio’s coming?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li class="number">Is he come?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIONDELLO">
  <li>Why, no, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li>What then?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIONDELLO">
  <li>He is coming.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li>When will he be here?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIONDELLO">
  <li class="number">When he stands where I am and sees you there.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li>But say, what to thine old news?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIONDELLO">
  <li>Why, Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old</li>
  <li>jerkin, a pair of old breeches thrice turned, a pair</li>
  <li>of boots that have been candle-cases, one buckled,</li>
  <li class="number">another laced, an old rusty sword ta’en out of the</li>
  <li>town-armory, with a broken hilt, and chapeless;</li>
  <li>with two broken points: his horse hipped with an</li>
  <li>old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred;</li>
  <li>besides, possessed with the glanders and like to mose</li>
  <li class="number">in the chine; troubled with the lampass, infected</li>
  <li>with the fashions, full of wingdalls, sped with</li>
  <li>spavins, rayed with yellows, past cure of the fives,</li>
  <li>stark spoiled with the staggers, begnawn with the</li>
  <li>bots, swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten;</li>
  <li class="number">near-legged before and with, a half-chequed bit</li>
  <li>and a head-stall of sheeps leather which, being</li>
  <li>restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been</li>
  <li>often burst and now repaired with knots; one girth</li>
  <li>six time pieced and a woman’s crupper of velure,</li>
  <li class="number">which hath two letters for her name fairly set down</li>
  <li>in studs, and here and there pieced with packthread.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li>Who comes with him?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIONDELLO">
  <li>O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparisoned</li>
  <li>like the horse; with a linen stock on one leg and a</li>
  <li class="number">kersey boot-hose on the other, gartered with a red</li>
  <li>and blue list; an old hat and ’the humour of forty</li>
  <li>fancies’ pricked in’t for a feather: a monster, a</li>
  <li>very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian</li>
  <li>footboy or a gentleman’s lackey.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li class="number">’Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;</li>
  <li>Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li>I am glad he’s come, howsoe’er he comes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIONDELLO">
  <li>Why, sir, he comes not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li>Didst thou not say he comes?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIONDELLO">
  <li class="number">Who? that Petruchio came?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li>Ay, that Petruchio came.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIONDELLO">
  <li>No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his back.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li>Why, that’s all one.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIONDELLO">
  <li>Nay, by Saint Jamy,</li>
  <li class="number">I hold you a penny,</li>
  <li>A horse and a man</li>
  <li>Is more than one,</li>
  <li>And yet not many.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO</div>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Come, where be these gallants? who’s at home?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li class="number">You are welcome, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>And yet I come not well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li>And yet you halt not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li>Not so well apparell’d</li>
  <li>As I wish you were.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li class="number">Were it better, I should rush in thus.</li>
  <li>But where is Kate? where is my lovely bride?</li>
  <li>How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown:</li>
  <li>And wherefore gaze this goodly company,</li>
  <li>As if they saw some wondrous monument,</li>
  <li class="number">Some comet or unusual prodigy?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li>Why, sir, you know this is your wedding-day:</li>
  <li>First were we sad, fearing you would not come;</li>
  <li>Now sadder, that you come so unprovided.</li>
  <li>Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate,</li>
  <li class="number">An eye-sore to our solemn festival!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li>And tells us, what occasion of import</li>
  <li>Hath all so long detain’d you from your wife,</li>
  <li>And sent you hither so unlike yourself?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear:</li>
  <li class="number">Sufficeth I am come to keep my word,</li>
  <li>Though in some part enforced to digress;</li>
  <li>Which, at more leisure, I will so excuse</li>
  <li>As you shall well be satisfied withal.</li>
  <li>But where is Kate? I stay too long from her:</li>
  <li class="number">The morning wears, ’tis time we were at church.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li>See not your bride in these unreverent robes:</li>
  <li>Go to my chamber; Put on clothes of mine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Not I, believe me: thus I’ll visit her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li>But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li class="number">Good sooth, even thus; therefore ha’ done with words:</li>
  <li>To me she’s married, not unto my clothes:</li>
  <li>Could I repair what she will wear in me,</li>
  <li>As I can change these poor accoutrements,</li>
  <li>’Twere well for Kate and better for myself.</li>
  <li class="number">But what a fool am I to chat with you,</li>
  <li>When I should bid good morrow to my bride,</li>
  <li>And seal the title with a lovely kiss!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO</div>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li>He hath some meaning in his mad attire:</li>
  <li>We will persuade him, be it possible,</li>
  <li class="number">To put on better ere he go to church.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li>I’ll after him, and see the event of this.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt BAPTISTA, GREMIO, and attendants</div>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li>But to her love concerneth us to add</li>
  <li>Her father’s liking: which to bring to pass,</li>
  <li>As I before unparted to your worship,</li>
  <li class="number">I am to get a man — whate’er he be,</li>
  <li>It skills not much. we’ll fit him to our turn — </li>
  <li>And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa;</li>
  <li>And make assurance here in Padua</li>
  <li>Of greater sums than I have promised.</li>
  <li class="number">So shall you quietly enjoy your hope,</li>
  <li>And marry sweet Bianca with consent.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCENTIO">
  <li>Were it not that my fellow-school-master</li>
  <li>Doth watch Bianca’s steps so narrowly,</li>
  <li>’Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage;</li>
  <li class="number">Which once perform’d, let all the world say no,</li>
  <li>I’ll keep mine own, despite of all the world.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li>That by degrees we mean to look into,</li>
  <li>And watch our vantage in this business:</li>

  <li>The quaint musician, amorous Licio;</li>
  <li>All for my master’s sake, Lucentio.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Re-enter GREMIO</li>
  <li>Signior Gremio, came you from the church?</li>

<ol data-speaker="GREMIO">
  <li>As willingly as e’er I came from school.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li class="number">And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREMIO">
  <li>A bridegroom say you? ’tis a groom indeed,</li>
  <li>A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li>Curster than she? why, ’tis impossible.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREMIO">
  <li>Why he’s a devil, a devil, a very fiend.</li>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li class="number">Why, she’s a devil, a devil, the devil’s dam.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREMIO">
  <li>Tut, she’s a lamb, a dove, a fool to him!</li>
  <li>I’ll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest</li>
  <li>Should ask, if Katharina should be his wife,</li>
  <li>’Ay, by gogs-wouns,’ quoth he; and swore so loud,</li>
  <li class="number">That, all-amazed, the priest let fall the book;</li>
  <li>And, as he stoop’d again to take it up,</li>
  <li>The mad-brain’d bridegroom took him such a cuff</li>
  <li>That down fell priest and book and book and priest:</li>
  <li>’Now take them up,’ quoth he, ’if any list.’</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li class="number">What said the wench when he rose again?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREMIO">
  <li>Trembled and shook; for why, he stamp’d and swore,</li>
  <li>As if the vicar meant to cozen him.</li>
  <li>But after many ceremonies done,</li>
  <li>He calls for wine: ’A health!’ quoth he, as if</li>
  <li class="number">He had been aboard, carousing to his mates</li>
  <li>After a storm; quaff’d off the muscadel</li>
  <li>And threw the sops all in the sexton’s face;</li>
  <li>Having no other reason</li>
  <li>But that his beard grew thin and hungerly</li>
  <li class="number">And seem’d to ask him sops as he was drinking.</li>
  <li>This done, he took the bride about the neck</li>
  <li>And kiss’d her lips with such a clamorous smack</li>
  <li>That at the parting all the church did echo:</li>
  <li>And I seeing this came thence for very shame;</li>
  <li class="number">And after me, I know, the rout is coming.</li>
  <li>Such a mad marriage never was before:</li>

  <li>before to make a fire, and they are coming after to</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CURTIS">
  <li>Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?</li>

<ol data-speaker="GRUMIO">
  <li>O, ay, Curtis, ay: and therefore fire, fire; cast</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRUMIO">
  <li class="number">She was, good Curtis, before this frost: but, thou</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CURTIS">
  <li>Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRUMIO">
  <li class="number">Am I but three inches? why, thy horn is a foot; and</li>

  <li>feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy hot office?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CURTIS">
  <li class="number">I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRUMIO">
  <li>A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine; and</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRUMIO">
  <li>Why, therefore fire; for I have caught extreme cold.</li>
  <li>Where’s the cook? is supper ready, the house</li>

  <li>Why, a horse.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRUMIO">
  <li>Tell thou the tale: but hadst thou not crossed me,</li>
  <li>thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she</li>
  <li class="number">under her horse; thou shouldst have heard in how</li>
  <li>miry a place, how she was bemoiled, how he left her</li>
  <li>with the horse upon her, how he beat me because</li>
  <li>her horse stumbled, how she waded through the dirt</li>
  <li>to pluck him off me, how he swore, how she prayed,</li>
  <li class="number">that never prayed before, how I cried, how the</li>
  <li>horses ran away, how her bridle was burst, how I</li>
  <li>lost my crupper, with many things of worthy memory,</li>
  <li>which now shall die in oblivion and thou return</li>
  <li>unexperienced to thy grave.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CURTIS">
  <li class="number">By this reckoning he is more shrew than she.</li>

  <li>To save your life in this extremity,</li>
  <li>This favour will I do you for his sake;</li>
  <li class="number">And think it not the worst of an your fortunes</li>
  <li>That you are like to Sir Vincentio.</li>
  <li>His name and credit shall you undertake,</li>
  <li>And in my house you shall be friendly lodged:</li>
  <li>Look that you take upon you as you should;</li>
  <li class="number">You understand me, sir: so shall you stay</li>
  <li>Till you have done your business in the city:</li>
  <li>If this be courtesy, sir, accept of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Pedant">
  <li>O sir, I do; and will repute you ever</li>
  <li>The patron of my life and liberty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li class="number">Then go with me to make the matter good.</li>
  <li>This, by the way, I let you understand;</li>
  <li>my father is here look’d for every day,</li>

  <li>Your betters have endured me say my mind,</li>
  <li class="number">And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.</li>
  <li>My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,</li>

<ol data-speaker="BIONDELLO">
  <li>I told him that your father was at Venice,</li>
  <li>And that you look’d for him this day in Padua.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li>Thou’rt a tall fellow: hold thee that to drink.</li>
  <li>Here comes Baptista: set your countenance, sir.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter BAPTISTA and LUCENTIO</li>
  <li class="number">Signior Baptista, you are happily met.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">To the Pedant</li>
  <li>Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of:</li>
  <li>I pray you stand good father to me now,</li>
  <li>Give me Bianca for my patrimony.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Pedant">
  <li>Soft son!</li>
  <li class="number">Sir, by your leave: having come to Padua</li>
  <li>To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio</li>
  <li>Made me acquainted with a weighty cause</li>
  <li>Of love between your daughter and himself:</li>
  <li>And, for the good report I hear of you</li>
  <li class="number">And for the love he beareth to your daughter</li>
  <li>And she to him, to stay him not too long,</li>
  <li>I am content, in a good father’s care,</li>
  <li>To have him match’d; and if you please to like</li>
  <li>No worse than I, upon some agreement</li>
  <li class="number">Me shall you find ready and willing</li>
  <li>With one consent to have her so bestow’d;</li>
  <li>For curious I cannot be with you,</li>
  <li>Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li>Sir, pardon me in what I have to say:</li>
  <li class="number">Your plainness and your shortness please me well.</li>
  <li>Right true it is, your son Lucentio here</li>
  <li>Doth love my daughter and she loveth him,</li>
  <li>Or both dissemble deeply their affections:</li>
  <li>And therefore, if you say no more than this,</li>
  <li class="number">That like a father you will deal with him</li>
  <li>And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,</li>
  <li>The match is made, and all is done:</li>
  <li>Your son shall have my daughter with consent.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li>I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best</li>
  <li class="number">We be affied and such assurance ta’en</li>
  <li>As shall with either part’s agreement stand?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li>Not in my house, Lucentio; for, you know,</li>
  <li>Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants:</li>
  <li>Besides, old Gremio is hearkening still;</li>
  <li class="number">And happily we might be interrupted.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li>Then at my lodging, an it like you:</li>
  <li>There doth my father lie; and there, this night,</li>
  <li>We’ll pass the business privately and well.</li>
  <li>Send for your daughter by your servant here:</li>
  <li class="number">My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.</li>
  <li>The worst is this, that, at so slender warning,</li>
  <li>You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li>It likes me well. Biondello, hie you home,</li>
  <li>And bid Bianca make her ready straight;</li>
  <li class="number">And, if you will, tell what hath happened,</li>
  <li>Lucentio’s father is arrived in Padua,</li>
  <li>And how she’s like to be Lucentio’s wife.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIONDELLO">
  <li>I pray the gods she may with all my heart!</li>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">

  <li>Faith, nothing; but has left me here behind, to</li>

  <li>I have no more to say, But bid Bianca farewell for</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCENTIO">
  <li>Hearest thou, Biondello?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIONDELLO">
  <li>I cannot tarry: I knew a wench married in an</li>

  <li class="number">And happily I have arrived at the last</li>
  <li>Unto the wished haven of my bliss.</li>
  <li>What Tranio did, myself enforced him to;</li>
  <li>Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VINCENTIO">
  <li>I’ll slit the villain’s nose, that would have sent</li>

  <li>But do you hear, sir? have you married my daughter</li>
  <li>without asking my good will?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VINCENTIO">
  <li>Fear not, Baptista; we will content you, go to: but</li>
  <li>I will in, to be revenged for this villany.</li>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>What, art thou ashamed of me?</li>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li>No, sir, God forbid; but ashamed to kiss.</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  Padua. LUCENTIO’S house.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter BAPTISTA, VINCENTIO, GREMIO, the Pedant,
LUCENTIO, BIANCA, PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, HORTENSIO,
and Widow, TRANIO, BIONDELLO, and GRUMIO the
Serving-men with Tranio bringing in a banquet</div>

<ol data-speaker="LUCENTIO">
  <li>At last, though long, our jarring notes agree:</li>
  <li>And time it is, when raging war is done,</li>
  <li>To smile at scapes and perils overblown.</li>
  <li>My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome,</li>
  <li class="number">While I with self-same kindness welcome thine.</li>
  <li>Brother Petruchio, sister Katharina,</li>
  <li>And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow,</li>
  <li>Feast with the best, and welcome to my house:</li>
  <li>My banquet is to close our stomachs up,</li>
  <li class="number">After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down;</li>
  <li>For now we sit to chat as well as eat.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li>Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Padua affords nothing but what is kind.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li class="number">For both our sakes, I would that word were true.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Widow">
  <li>Then never trust me, if I be afeard.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense:</li>
  <li>I mean, Hortensio is afeard of you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Widow">
  <li class="number">He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Roundly replied.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li>Mistress, how mean you that?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Widow">
  <li>Thus I conceive by him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Conceives by me! How likes Hortensio that?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li class="number">My widow says, thus she conceives her tale.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li>’He that is giddy thinks the world turns round:’</li>
  <li>I pray you, tell me what you meant by that.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Widow">
  <li>Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,</li>
  <li class="number">Measures my husband’s sorrow by his woe:</li>
  <li>And now you know my meaning,</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li>A very mean meaning.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Widow">
  <li>Right, I mean you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li>And I am mean indeed, respecting you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li class="number">To her, Kate!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li>To her, widow!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li>That’s my office.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Spoke like an officer; ha’ to thee, lad!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Drinks to HORTENSIO</div>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li class="number">How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREMIO">
  <li>Believe me, sir, they butt together well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIANCA">
  <li>Head, and butt! an hasty-witted body</li>
  <li>Would say your head and butt were head and horn.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VINCENTIO">
  <li>Ay, mistress bride, hath that awaken’d you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIANCA">
  <li class="number">Ay, but not frighted me; therefore I’ll sleep again.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Nay, that you shall not: since you have begun,</li>
  <li>Have at you for a bitter jest or two!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIANCA">
  <li>Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush;</li>
  <li>And then pursue me as you draw your bow.</li>
  <li class="number">You are welcome all.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt BIANCA, KATHARINA, and Widow</div>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>She hath prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio.</li>
  <li>This bird you aim’d at, though you hit her not;</li>
  <li>Therefore a health to all that shot and miss’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li>O, sir, Lucentio slipp’d me like his greyhound,</li>
  <li class="number">Which runs himself and catches for his master.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>A good swift simile, but something currish.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRANIO">
  <li>’Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself:</li>
  <li>’Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li>O ho, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCENTIO">
  <li class="number">I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li>Confess, confess, hath he not hit you here?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>A’ has a little gall’d me, I confess;</li>
  <li>And, as the jest did glance away from me,</li>
  <li>’Tis ten to one it maim’d you two outright.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li class="number">Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,</li>
  <li>I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Well, I say no: and therefore for assurance</li>
  <li>Let’s each one send unto his wife;</li>
  <li>And he whose wife is most obedient</li>
  <li class="number">To come at first when he doth send for her,</li>
  <li>Shall win the wager which we will propose.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li>Content. What is the wager?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCENTIO">
  <li>Twenty crowns.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Twenty crowns!</li>
  <li class="number">I’ll venture so much of my hawk or hound,</li>
  <li>But twenty times so much upon my wife.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCENTIO">
  <li>A hundred then.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li>Content.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>A match! ’tis done.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li class="number">Who shall begin?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCENTIO">
  <li>That will I.</li>
  <li>Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIONDELLO">
  <li>I go.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li>Son, I’ll be your half, Bianca comes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCENTIO">
  <li class="number">I’ll have no halves; I’ll bear it all myself.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Re-enter BIONDELLO</li>
  <li>How now! what news?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIONDELLO">
  <li>Sir, my mistress sends you word</li>
  <li>That she is busy and she cannot come.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>How! she is busy and she cannot come!</li>
  <li class="number">Is that an answer?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREMIO">
  <li>Ay, and a kind one too:</li>
  <li>Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>I hope better.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li>Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife</li>
  <li class="number">To come to me forthwith.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit BIONDELLO</div>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>O, ho! entreat her!</li>
  <li>Nay, then she must needs come.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li>I am afraid, sir,</li>
  <li>Do what you can, yours will not be entreated.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Re-enter BIONDELLO</li>
  <li class="number">Now, where’s my wife?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIONDELLO">
  <li>She says you have some goodly jest in hand:</li>
  <li>She will not come: she bids you come to her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Worse and worse; she will not come! O vile,</li>
  <li>Intolerable, not to be endured!</li>
  <li class="number">Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress;</li>
  <li>Say, I command her to come to me.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit GRUMIO</div>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li>I know her answer.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>What?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li>She will not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li class="number">The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li>Now, by my holidame, here comes Katharina!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Re-enter KATARINA</div>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li>What is your will, sir, that you send for me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Where is your sister, and Hortensio’s wife?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li>They sit conferring by the parlor fire.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li class="number">Go fetch them hither: if they deny to come.</li>
  <li>Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands:</li>
  <li>Away, I say, and bring them hither straight.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit KATHARINA</div>

<ol data-speaker="LUCENTIO">
  <li>Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li>And so it is: I wonder what it bodes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li class="number">Marry, peace it bodes, and love and quiet life,</li>
  <li>And awful rule and right supremacy;</li>
  <li>And, to be short, what not, that’s sweet and happy?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAPTISTA">
  <li>Now, fair befal thee, good Petruchio!</li>
  <li>The wager thou hast won; and I will add</li>
  <li class="number">Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;</li>
  <li>Another dowry to another daughter,</li>
  <li>For she is changed, as she had never been.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Nay, I will win my wager better yet</li>
  <li>And show more sign of her obedience,</li>
  <li class="number">Her new-built virtue and obedience.</li>
  <li>See where she comes and brings your froward wives</li>
  <li>As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Re-enter KATHARINA, with BIANCA and Widow</li>
  <li>Katharina, that cap of yours becomes you not:</li>
  <li>Off with that bauble, throw it under-foot.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Widow">
  <li class="number">Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh,</li>
  <li>Till I be brought to such a silly pass!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIANCA">
  <li>Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCENTIO">
  <li>I would your duty were as foolish too:</li>
  <li>The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,</li>
  <li class="number">Hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIANCA">
  <li>The more fool you, for laying on my duty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Katharina, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women</li>
  <li>What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Widow">
  <li>Come, come, you’re mocking: we will have no telling.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li class="number">Come on, I say; and first begin with her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Widow">
  <li>She shall not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>I say she shall: and first begin with her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINA">
  <li>Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,</li>
  <li>And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,</li>
  <li class="number">To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor:</li>
  <li>It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,</li>
  <li>Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,</li>
  <li>And in no sense is meet or amiable.</li>
  <li>A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,</li>
  <li class="number">Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;</li>
  <li>And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty</li>
  <li>Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.</li>
  <li>Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,</li>
  <li>Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,</li>
  <li class="number">And for thy maintenance commits his body</li>
  <li>To painful labour both by sea and land,</li>
  <li>To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,</li>
  <li>Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;</li>
  <li>And craves no other tribute at thy hands</li>
  <li class="number">But love, fair looks and true obedience;</li>
  <li>Too little payment for so great a debt.</li>
  <li>Such duty as the subject owes the prince</li>
  <li>Even such a woman oweth to her husband;</li>
  <li>And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,</li>
  <li class="number">And not obedient to his honest will,</li>
  <li>What is she but a foul contending rebel</li>
  <li>And graceless traitor to her loving lord?</li>
  <li>I am ashamed that women are so simple</li>
  <li>To offer war where they should kneel for peace;</li>
  <li class="number">Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway,</li>
  <li>When they are bound to serve, love and obey.</li>
  <li>Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,</li>
  <li>Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,</li>
  <li>But that our soft conditions and our hearts</li>
  <li class="number">Should well agree with our external parts?</li>
  <li>Come, come, you froward and unable worms!</li>
  <li>My mind hath been as big as one of yours,</li>
  <li>My heart as great, my reason haply more,</li>
  <li>To bandy word for word and frown for frown;</li>
  <li class="number">But now I see our lances are but straws,</li>
  <li>Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,</li>
  <li>That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.</li>
  <li>Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,</li>
  <li>And place your hands below your husband’s foot:</li>
  <li class="number">In token of which duty, if he please,</li>
  <li>My hand is ready; may it do him ease.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Why, there’s a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCENTIO">
  <li>Well, go thy ways, old lad; for thou shalt ha’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VINCENTIO">
  <li>’Tis a good hearing when children are toward.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCENTIO">
  <li class="number">But a harsh hearing when women are froward.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PETRUCHIO">
  <li>Come, Kate, we’ll to bed.</li>
  <li>We three are married, but you two are sped.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">To LUCENTIO</li>
  <li>’Twas I won the wager, though you hit the white;</li>
  <li>And, being a winner, God give you good night!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA</div>

<ol data-speaker="HORTENSIO">
  <li class="number">Now, go thy ways; thou hast tamed a curst shrew.</li>
