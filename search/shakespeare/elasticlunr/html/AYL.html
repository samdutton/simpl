<h3>SCENE I.  Orchard of Oliver’s house.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter ORLANDO and ADAM</div>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion</li>
  <li>bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,</li>
  <li>and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his</li>
  <li>blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my</li>
  <li class="number">sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and</li>
  <li>report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,</li>
  <li>he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more</li>
  <li>properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you</li>
  <li>that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that</li>
  <li class="number">differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses</li>
  <li>are bred better; for, besides that they are fair</li>
  <li>with their feeding, they are taught their manage,</li>
  <li>and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his</li>
  <li>brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the</li>
  <li class="number">which his animals on his dunghills are as much</li>
  <li>bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so</li>
  <li>plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave</li>
  <li>me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets</li>
  <li>me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a</li>
  <li class="number">brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my</li>
  <li>gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that</li>
  <li>grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I</li>
  <li>think is within me, begins to mutiny against this</li>
  <li>servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I</li>
  <li class="number">know no wise remedy how to avoid it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ADAM">
  <li>Yonder comes my master, your brother.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will</li>
  <li>shake me up.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter OLIVER</div>

<ol data-speaker="OLIVER">
  <li>Now, sir! what make you here?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li class="number">Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OLIVER">
  <li>What mar you then, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God</li>
  <li>made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OLIVER">
  <li>Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li class="number">Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?</li>
  <li>What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should</li>
  <li>come to such penury?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OLIVER">
  <li>Know you where your are, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OLIVER">
  <li class="number">Know you before whom, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know</li>
  <li>you are my eldest brother; and, in the gentle</li>
  <li>condition of blood, you should so know me. The</li>
  <li>courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that</li>
  <li class="number">you are the first-born; but the same tradition</li>
  <li>takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers</li>
  <li>betwixt us: I have as much of my father in me as</li>
  <li>you; albeit, I confess, your coming before me is</li>
  <li>nearer to his reverence.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OLIVER">
  <li class="number">What, boy!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OLIVER">
  <li>Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir</li>
  <li>Rowland de Boys; he was my father, and he is thrice</li>
  <li class="number">a villain that says such a father begot villains.</li>
  <li>Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand</li>
  <li>from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy</li>
  <li>tongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ADAM">
  <li>Sweet masters, be patient: for your father’s</li>
  <li class="number">remembrance, be at accord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OLIVER">
  <li>Let me go, I say.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>I will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My</li>
  <li>father charged you in his will to give me good</li>
  <li>education: you have trained me like a peasant,</li>
  <li class="number">obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like</li>
  <li>qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in</li>
  <li>me, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow</li>
  <li>me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or</li>
  <li>give me the poor allottery my father left me by</li>
  <li class="number">testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OLIVER">
  <li>And what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent?</li>
  <li>Well, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubled</li>
  <li>with you; you shall have some part of your will: I</li>
  <li>pray you, leave me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li class="number">I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OLIVER">
  <li>Get you with him, you old dog.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ADAM">
  <li>Is ’old dog’ my reward? Most true, I have lost my</li>
  <li>teeth in your service. God be with my old master!</li>
  <li>he would not have spoke such a word.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM</div>

<ol data-speaker="OLIVER">
  <li class="number">Is it even so? begin you to grow upon me? I will</li>
  <li>physic your rankness, and yet give no thousand</li>
  <li>crowns neither. Holla, Dennis!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter DENNIS</div>

<ol data-speaker="DENNIS">
  <li>Calls your worship?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OLIVER">
  <li>Was not Charles, the duke’s wrestler, here to speak with me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DENNIS">
  <li class="number">So please you, he is here at the door and importunes</li>
  <li>access to you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OLIVER">
  <li>Call him in.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exit DENNIS</li>
  <li>’Twill be a good way; and to-morrow the wrestling is.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter CHARLES</div>

<ol data-speaker="CHARLES">
  <li>Good morrow to your worship.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OLIVER">
  <li class="number">Good Monsieur Charles, what’s the new news at the</li>
  <li>new court?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CHARLES">
  <li>There’s no news at the court, sir, but the old news:</li>
  <li>that is, the old duke is banished by his younger</li>
  <li>brother the new duke; and three or four loving lords</li>
  <li class="number">have put themselves into voluntary exile with him,</li>
  <li>whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke;</li>
  <li>therefore he gives them good leave to wander.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OLIVER">
  <li>Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke’s daughter, be</li>
  <li>banished with her father?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CHARLES">
  <li class="number">O, no; for the duke’s daughter, her cousin, so loves</li>
  <li>her, being ever from their cradles bred together,</li>
  <li>that she would have followed her exile, or have died</li>
  <li>to stay behind her. She is at the court, and no</li>
  <li>less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; and</li>
  <li class="number">never two ladies loved as they do.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OLIVER">
  <li>Where will the old duke live?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CHARLES">
  <li>They say he is already in the forest of Arden, and</li>
  <li>a many merry men with him; and there they live like</li>
  <li>the old Robin Hood of England: they say many young</li>
  <li class="number">gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time</li>
  <li>carelessly, as they did in the golden world.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OLIVER">
  <li>What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CHARLES">
  <li>Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a</li>
  <li>matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand</li>
  <li class="number">that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition</li>
  <li>to come in disguised against me to try a fall.</li>
  <li>To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he that</li>
  <li>escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him</li>
  <li>well. Your brother is but young and tender; and,</li>
  <li class="number">for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I</li>
  <li>must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,</li>
  <li>out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you</li>
  <li>withal, that either you might stay him from his</li>
  <li>intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall</li>
  <li class="number">run into, in that it is a thing of his own search</li>
  <li>and altogether against my will.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OLIVER">
  <li>Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which</li>
  <li>thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had</li>
  <li>myself notice of my brother’s purpose herein and</li>
  <li class="number">have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from</li>
  <li>it, but he is resolute. I’ll tell thee, Charles:</li>
  <li>it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full</li>
  <li>of ambition, an envious emulator of every man’s</li>
  <li>good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against</li>
  <li class="number">me his natural brother: therefore use thy</li>
  <li>discretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck</li>
  <li>as his finger. And thou wert best look to’t; for if</li>
  <li>thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not</li>
  <li>mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise</li>
  <li class="number">against thee by poison, entrap thee by some</li>
  <li>treacherous device and never leave thee till he</li>
  <li>hath ta’en thy life by some indirect means or other;</li>
  <li>for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak</li>
  <li>it, there is not one so young and so villanous this</li>
  <li class="number">day living. I speak but brotherly of him; but</li>
  <li>should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must</li>
  <li>blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CHARLES">
  <li>I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come</li>
  <li>to-morrow, I’ll give him his payment: if ever he go</li>
  <li class="number">alone again, I’ll never wrestle for prize more: and</li>
  <li>so God keep your worship!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OLIVER">
  <li>Farewell, good Charles.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exit CHARLES</li>
  <li>Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see</li>
  <li>an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,</li>
  <li class="number">hates nothing more than he. Yet he’s gentle, never</li>
  <li>schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of</li>
  <li>all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much</li>
  <li>in the heart of the world, and especially of my own</li>
  <li>people, who best know him, that I am altogether</li>
  <li class="number">misprised: but it shall not be so long; this</li>
  <li>wrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that</li>
  <li>I kindle the boy thither; which now I’ll go about.</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  Lawn before the Duke’s palace.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter CELIA and ROSALIND</div>

<ol data-speaker="CELIA">
  <li>I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of;</li>
  <li>and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could</li>
  <li>teach me to forget a banished father, you must not</li>
  <li class="number">learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CELIA">
  <li>Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight</li>
  <li>that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father,</li>
  <li>had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou</li>
  <li>hadst been still with me, I could have taught my</li>
  <li class="number">love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,</li>
  <li>if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously</li>
  <li>tempered as mine is to thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to</li>
  <li>rejoice in yours.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CELIA">
  <li class="number">You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is</li>
  <li>like to have: and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt</li>
  <li>be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy</li>
  <li>father perforce, I will render thee again in</li>
  <li>affection; by mine honour, I will; and when I break</li>
  <li class="number">that oath, let me turn monster: therefore, my</li>
  <li>sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let</li>
  <li>me see; what think you of falling in love?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CELIA">
  <li>Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal: but</li>
  <li class="number">love no man in good earnest; nor no further in sport</li>
  <li>neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst</li>
  <li>in honour come off again.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>What shall be our sport, then?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CELIA">
  <li>Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from</li>
  <li class="number">her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>I would we could do so, for her benefits are</li>
  <li>mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman</li>
  <li>doth most mistake in her gifts to women.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CELIA">
  <li>’Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce</li>
  <li class="number">makes honest, and those that she makes honest she</li>
  <li>makes very ill-favouredly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>Nay, now thou goest from Fortune’s office to</li>
  <li>Nature’s: Fortune reigns in gifts of the world,</li>
  <li>not in the lineaments of Nature.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter TOUCHSTONE</div>

<ol data-speaker="CELIA">
  <li class="number">No? when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she</li>
  <li>not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature</li>
  <li>hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not</li>
  <li>Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when</li>
  <li class="number">Fortune makes Nature’s natural the cutter-off of</li>
  <li>Nature’s wit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CELIA">
  <li>Peradventure this is not Fortune’s work neither, but</li>
  <li>Nature’s; who perceiveth our natural wits too dull</li>
  <li>to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this</li>
  <li class="number">natural for our whetstone; for always the dulness of</li>
  <li>the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now,</li>
  <li>wit! whither wander you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TOUCHSTONE">
  <li>Mistress, you must come away to your father.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CELIA">
  <li>Were you made the messenger?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TOUCHSTONE">
  <li class="number">No, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>Where learned you that oath, fool?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TOUCHSTONE">
  <li>Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they</li>
  <li>were good pancakes and swore by his honour the</li>
  <li>mustard was naught: now I’ll stand to it, the</li>
  <li class="number">pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and</li>
  <li>yet was not the knight forsworn.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CELIA">
  <li>How prove you that, in the great heap of your</li>
  <li>knowledge?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TOUCHSTONE">
  <li class="number">Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and</li>
  <li>swear by your beards that I am a knave.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CELIA">
  <li>By our beards, if we had them, thou art.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TOUCHSTONE">
  <li>By my knavery, if I had it, then I were; but if you</li>
  <li>swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no</li>
  <li class="number">more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he</li>
  <li>never had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away</li>
  <li>before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CELIA">
  <li>Prithee, who is’t that thou meanest?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TOUCHSTONE">
  <li>One that old Frederick, your father, loves.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CELIA">
  <li class="number">My father’s love is enough to honour him: enough!</li>
  <li>speak no more of him; you’ll be whipped for taxation</li>
  <li>one of these days.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TOUCHSTONE">
  <li>The more pity, that fools may not speak wisely what</li>
  <li>wise men do foolishly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CELIA">
  <li class="number">By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little</li>
  <li>wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery</li>
  <li>that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes</li>
  <li>Monsieur Le Beau.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>With his mouth full of news.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CELIA">
  <li class="number">Which he will put on us, as pigeons feed their young.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>Then shall we be news-crammed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CELIA">
  <li>All the better; we shall be the more marketable.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter LE BEAU</li>
  <li>Bon jour, Monsieur Le Beau: what’s the news?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LE BEAU">
  <li>Fair princess, you have lost much good sport.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CELIA">
  <li class="number">Sport! of what colour?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LE BEAU">
  <li>What colour, madam! how shall I answer you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>As wit and fortune will.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TOUCHSTONE">
  <li>Or as the Destinies decree.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CELIA">
  <li>Well said: that was laid on with a trowel.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TOUCHSTONE">
  <li class="number">Nay, if I keep not my rank — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>Thou losest thy old smell.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LE BEAU">
  <li>You amaze me, ladies: I would have told you of good</li>
  <li>wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>You tell us the manner of the wrestling.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LE BEAU">
  <li class="number">I will tell you the beginning; and, if it please</li>
  <li>your ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is</li>
  <li>yet to do; and here, where you are, they are coming</li>
  <li>to perform it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CELIA">
  <li>Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LE BEAU">
  <li class="number">There comes an old man and his three sons — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CELIA">
  <li>I could match this beginning with an old tale.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LE BEAU">
  <li>Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>With bills on their necks, ’Be it known unto all men</li>
  <li>by these presents.’</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LE BEAU">
  <li class="number">The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the</li>
  <li>duke’s wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him</li>
  <li>and broke three of his ribs, that there is little</li>
  <li>hope of life in him: so he served the second, and</li>
  <li>so the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,</li>
  <li class="number">their father, making such pitiful dole over them</li>
  <li>that all the beholders take his part with weeping.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>Alas!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TOUCHSTONE">
  <li>But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies</li>
  <li>have lost?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LE BEAU">
  <li class="number">Why, this that I speak of.</li>

  <li>How now, daughter and cousin! are you crept hither</li>
  <li>to see the wrestling?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE FREDERICK">
  <li class="number">You will take little delight in it, I can tell you;</li>
  <li>there is such odds in the man. In pity of the</li>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>Young man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?</li>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li class="number">No, fair princess; he is the general challenger: I</li>
  <li>come but in, as others do, to try with him the</li>
  <li>strength of my youth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CELIA">
  <li>Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your</li>
  <li>years. You have seen cruel proof of this man’s</li>
  <li class="number">strength: if you saw yourself with your eyes or</li>
  <li>knew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your</li>
  <li>adventure would counsel you to a more equal</li>
  <li>enterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to</li>
  <li>embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li class="number">Do, young sir; your reputation shall not therefore</li>
  <li>be misprised: we will make it our suit to the duke</li>
  <li>that the wrestling might not go forward.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>I beseech you, punish me not with your hard</li>
  <li>thoughts; wherein I confess me much guilty, to deny</li>
  <li class="number">so fair and excellent ladies any thing. But let</li>
  <li>your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my</li>
  <li>trial: wherein if I be foiled, there is but one</li>
  <li>shamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one</li>
  <li>dead that was willing to be so: I shall do my</li>
  <li class="number">friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me, the</li>
  <li>world no injury, for in it I have nothing; only in</li>
  <li>the world I fill up a place, which may be better</li>
  <li>supplied when I have made it empty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>The little strength that I have, I would it were with you.</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK, train, and LE BEAU</div>

<ol data-speaker="CELIA">
  <li>Were I my father, coz, would I do this?</li>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>I am more proud to be Sir Rowland’s son,</li>
  <li>His youngest son; and would not change that calling,</li>
  <li>To be adopted heir to Frederick.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li class="number">My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,</li>
  <li>And all the world was of my father’s mind:</li>

  <li>Ere he should thus have ventured.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CELIA">
  <li class="number">Gentle cousin,</li>
  <li>Let us go thank him and encourage him:</li>
  <li>My father’s rough and envious disposition</li>

<ol data-speaker="CELIA">
  <li>Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman.</li>

  <li>Can I not say, I thank you? My better parts</li>

  <li>Yet such is now the duke’s condition</li>
  <li>That he misconstrues all that you have done.</li>
  <li class="number">The duke is humorous; what he is indeed,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>I thank you, sir: and, pray you, tell me this:</li>
  <li>Which of the two was daughter of the duke</li>
  <li>That here was at the wrestling?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LE BEAU">
  <li class="number">Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners;</li>
  <li>But yet indeed the lesser is his daughter</li>
  <li>The other is daughter to the banish’d duke,</li>
  <li>And here detain’d by her usurping uncle,</li>
  <li>To keep his daughter company; whose loves</li>
  <li class="number">Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.</li>
  <li>But I can tell you that of late this duke</li>
  <li>Hath ta’en displeasure ’gainst his gentle niece,</li>
  <li>Grounded upon no other argument</li>
  <li>But that the people praise her for her virtues</li>
  <li class="number">And pity her for her good father’s sake;</li>
  <li>And, on my life, his malice ’gainst the lady</li>
  <li>Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well:</li>
  <li>Hereafter, in a better world than this,</li>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>Not one to throw at a dog.</li>

<ol data-speaker="CELIA">
  <li>No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon</li>

  <li>But is all this for your father?</li>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>No, some of it is for my child’s father. O, how</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CELIA">
  <li>They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in</li>

  <li>O, a good wish upon you! you will try in time, in</li>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>The duke my father loved his father dearly.</li>

  <li>You, cousin</li>
  <li>Within these ten days if that thou be’st found</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>I do beseech your grace,</li>

  <li class="number">If that I do not dream or be not frantic — </li>

  <li>Thus do all traitors:</li>

  <li>So was I when your highness took his dukedom;</li>
  <li>So was I when your highness banish’d him:</li>
  <li>Treason is not inherited, my lord;</li>
  <li>Or, if we did derive it from our friends,</li>
  <li class="number">What’s that to me? my father was no traitor:</li>
  <li>Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much</li>
  <li>To think my poverty is treacherous.</li>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE FREDERICK">
  <li>Ay, Celia; we stay’d her for your sake,</li>
  <li class="number">Else had she with her father ranged along.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CELIA">
  <li>I did not then entreat to have her stay;</li>
  <li>It was your pleasure and your own remorse:</li>
  <li>I was too young that time to value her;</li>
  <li>But now I know her: if she be a traitor,</li>
  <li class="number">Why so am I; we still have slept together,</li>
  <li>Rose at an instant, learn’d, play’d, eat together,</li>
  <li>And wheresoever we went, like Juno’s swans,</li>
  <li>Still we went coupled and inseparable.</li>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE FREDERICK">
  <li>She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,</li>

  <li>Thou art a fool: she robs thee of thy name;</li>
  <li>And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous</li>
  <li>When she is gone. Then open not thy lips:</li>

  <li>No: let my father seek another heir.</li>
  <li>Therefore devise with me how we may fly,</li>

  <li>Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>Were it not better,</li>

  <li>That I did suit me all points like a man?</li>
  <li>A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,</li>
  <li>A boar-spear in my hand; and — in my heart</li>
  <li>Lie there what hidden woman’s fear there will — </li>
  <li class="number">We’ll have a swashing and a martial outside,</li>
  <li>As many other mannish cowards have</li>
  <li>That do outface it with their semblances.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CELIA">
  <li>What shall I call thee when thou art a man?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>I’ll have no worse a name than Jove’s own page;</li>
  <li class="number">And therefore look you call me Ganymede.</li>
  <li>But what will you be call’d?</li>

<ol data-speaker="CELIA">
  <li>Something that hath a reference to my state</li>
  <li>No longer Celia, but Aliena.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>But, cousin, what if we assay’d to steal</li>
  <li class="number">The clownish fool out of your father’s court?</li>
  <li>Would he not be a comfort to our travel?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CELIA">
  <li>He’ll go along o’er the wide world with me;</li>
  <li>Leave me alone to woo him. Let’s away,</li>
  <li>And get our jewels and our wealth together,</li>
  <li class="number">Devise the fittest time and safest way</li>
  <li>To hide us from pursuit that will be made</li>
  <li>After my flight. Now go we in content</li>

  <li class="number">’This is no flattery: these are counsellors</li>
  <li>That feelingly persuade me what I am.’</li>
  <li>Sweet are the uses of adversity,</li>
  <li>Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,</li>
  <li>Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;</li>
  <li class="number">And this our life exempt from public haunt</li>

<ol data-speaker="First Lord">
  <li>O, yes, into a thousand similes.</li>
  <li>First, for his weeping into the needless stream;</li>
  <li class="number">’Poor deer,’ quoth he, ’thou makest a testament</li>

  <li>And never stays to greet him; ’Ay’ quoth Jaques,</li>
  <li>’Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;</li>
  <li>’Tis just the fashion: wherefore do you look</li>
  <li class="number">Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?’</li>
  <li>Thus most invectively he pierceth through</li>
  <li>The body of the country, city, court,</li>
  <li>Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we</li>
  <li>Are mere usurpers, tyrants and what’s worse,</li>
  <li class="number">To fright the animals and to kill them up</li>
  <li>In their assign’d and native dwelling-place.</li>

  <li>What, my young master? O, my gentle master!</li>
  <li>O my sweet master! O you memory</li>
  <li>Of old Sir Rowland! why, what make you here?</li>
  <li class="number">Why are you virtuous? why do people love you?</li>
  <li>And wherefore are you gentle, strong and valiant?</li>
  <li>Why would you be so fond to overcome</li>
  <li>The bonny priser of the humorous duke?</li>
  <li>Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.</li>
  <li class="number">Know you not, master, to some kind of men</li>
  <li>Their graces serve them but as enemies?</li>
  <li>No more do yours: your virtues, gentle master,</li>
  <li>Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.</li>
  <li>O, what a world is this, when what is comely</li>
  <li class="number">Envenoms him that bears it!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>Why, what’s the matter?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ADAM">
  <li>O unhappy youth!</li>
  <li>Come not within these doors; within this roof</li>
  <li>The enemy of all your graces lives:</li>
  <li class="number">Your brother — no, no brother; yet the son — </li>
  <li>Yet not the son, I will not call him son</li>
  <li>Of him I was about to call his father — </li>
  <li>Hath heard your praises, and this night he means</li>
  <li>To burn the lodging where you use to lie</li>
  <li class="number">And you within it: if he fail of that,</li>
  <li>He will have other means to cut you off.</li>
  <li>I overheard him and his practises.</li>
  <li>This is no place; this house is but a butchery:</li>
  <li>Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li class="number">Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?</li>

<ol data-speaker="ADAM">
  <li>No matter whither, so you come not here.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food?</li>
  <li>Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce</li>
  <li>A thievish living on the common road?</li>
  <li class="number">This I must do, or know not what to do:</li>
  <li>Yet this I will not do, do how I can;</li>
  <li>I rather will subject me to the malice</li>

  <li class="number">Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,</li>
  <li>Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold;</li>
  <li>And all this I give you. Let me be your servant:</li>
  <li>Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;</li>
  <li>For in my youth I never did apply</li>
  <li class="number">Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,</li>
  <li>Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo</li>
  <li>The means of weakness and debility;</li>
  <li>Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,</li>
  <li>Frosty, but kindly: let me go with you;</li>
  <li class="number">I’ll do the service of a younger man</li>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>O good old man, how well in thee appears</li>
  <li>The constant service of the antique world,</li>
  <li>When service sweat for duty, not for meed!</li>
  <li class="number">Thou art not for the fashion of these times,</li>
  <li>Where none will sweat but for promotion,</li>
  <li>And having that, do choke their service up</li>
  <li>Even with the having: it is not so with thee.</li>
  <li>But, poor old man, thou prunest a rotten tree,</li>

  <li>From seventeen years till now almost fourscore</li>
  <li>Here lived I, but now live here no more.</li>
  <li>At seventeen years many their fortunes seek;</li>
  <li class="number">But at fourscore it is too late a week:</li>

  <li>The motley fool thus moral on the time,</li>
  <li class="number">My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,</li>
  <li>That fools should be so deep-contemplative,</li>

  <li>O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,</li>

  <li class="number">To blow on whom I please; for so fools have;</li>
  <li>And they that are most galled with my folly,</li>
  <li>They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?</li>
  <li>The ’why’ is plain as way to parish church:</li>
  <li>He that a fool doth very wisely hit</li>
  <li class="number">Doth very foolishly, although he smart,</li>
  <li>Not to seem senseless of the bob: if not,</li>
  <li>The wise man’s folly is anatomized</li>

  <li>Invest me in my motley; give me leave</li>

  <li>Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,</li>
  <li class="number">Seeking the bubble reputation</li>
  <li>Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,</li>

  <li>With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,</li>
  <li>His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide</li>
  <li>For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,</li>
  <li class="number">Turning again toward childish treble, pipes</li>
  <li>And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,</li>

<ol data-speaker="CORIN">
  <li>And how like you this shepherd’s life, Master Touchstone?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TOUCHSTONE">
  <li>Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good</li>
  <li>life, but in respect that it is a shepherd’s life,</li>
  <li>it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I</li>
  <li class="number">like it very well; but in respect that it is</li>
  <li>private, it is a very vile life. Now, in respect it</li>
  <li>is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in</li>
  <li>respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As</li>
  <li>is it a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well;</li>
  <li class="number">but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much</li>
  <li>against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CORIN">
  <li>No more but that I know the more one sickens the</li>
  <li>worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money,</li>
  <li>means and content is without three good friends;</li>
  <li class="number">that the property of rain is to wet and fire to</li>
  <li>burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep, and that a</li>
  <li>great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that</li>
  <li>he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may</li>
  <li>complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TOUCHSTONE">
  <li class="number">Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in</li>
  <li>court, shepherd?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CORIN">
  <li>No, truly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TOUCHSTONE">
  <li>Then thou art damned.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CORIN">
  <li>Nay, I hope.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TOUCHSTONE">
  <li class="number">Truly, thou art damned like an ill-roasted egg, all</li>
  <li>on one side.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CORIN">
  <li>For not being at court? Your reason.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TOUCHSTONE">
  <li>Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never sawest</li>
  <li>good manners; if thou never sawest good manners,</li>
  <li class="number">then thy manners must be wicked; and wickedness is</li>
  <li>sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous</li>
  <li>state, shepherd.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CORIN">
  <li>Not a whit, Touchstone: those that are good manners</li>
  <li>at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the</li>
  <li class="number">behavior of the country is most mockable at the</li>
  <li>court. You told me you salute not at the court, but</li>
  <li>you kiss your hands: that courtesy would be</li>
  <li>uncleanly, if courtiers were shepherds.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TOUCHSTONE">
  <li>Instance, briefly; come, instance.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CORIN">
  <li class="number">Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their</li>
  <li>fells, you know, are greasy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TOUCHSTONE">
  <li>Why, do not your courtier’s hands sweat? and is not</li>
  <li>the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of</li>
  <li>a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say; come.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CORIN">
  <li class="number">Besides, our hands are hard.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TOUCHSTONE">
  <li>Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again.</li>
  <li>A more sounder instance, come.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CORIN">
  <li>And they are often tarred over with the surgery of</li>
  <li>our sheep: and would you have us kiss tar? The</li>
  <li class="number">courtier’s hands are perfumed with civet.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TOUCHSTONE">
  <li>Most shallow man! thou worms-meat, in respect of a</li>
  <li>good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and</li>
  <li>perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the</li>
  <li>very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CORIN">
  <li class="number">You have too courtly a wit for me: I’ll rest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TOUCHSTONE">
  <li>Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man!</li>
  <li>God make incision in thee! thou art raw.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CORIN">
  <li>Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get</li>
  <li>that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man’s</li>
  <li class="number">happiness, glad of other men’s good, content with my</li>
  <li>harm, and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes</li>
  <li>graze and my lambs suck.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TOUCHSTONE">
  <li>That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes</li>
  <li>and the rams together and to offer to get your</li>
  <li class="number">living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a</li>
  <li>bell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of a</li>
  <li>twelvemonth to a crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,</li>
  <li>out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not</li>
  <li>damned for this, the devil himself will have no</li>

  <li class="number">That’s no matter: the feet might bear the verses.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>Ay, but the feet were lame and could not bear</li>
  <li>themselves without the verse and therefore stood</li>
  <li>lamely in the verse.</li>

  <li>But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name</li>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder</li>

  <li>O Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends to</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>Nay, but who is it?</li>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>Nay, I prithee now with most petitionary vehemence,</li>

<ol data-speaker="CELIA">
  <li>O wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderful</li>
  <li>wonderful! and yet again wonderful, and after that,</li>
  <li class="number">out of all hooping!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>Good my complexion! dost thou think, though I am</li>
  <li>caparisoned like a man, I have a doublet and hose in</li>
  <li>my disposition? One inch of delay more is a</li>
  <li>South-sea of discovery; I prithee, tell me who is it</li>
  <li class="number">quickly, and speak apace. I would thou couldst</li>
  <li>stammer, that thou mightst pour this concealed man</li>
  <li>out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of a narrow-</li>
  <li>mouthed bottle, either too much at once, or none at</li>
  <li>all. I prithee, take the cork out of thy mouth that</li>
  <li class="number">may drink thy tidings.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CELIA">
  <li>So you may put a man in your belly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>Is he of God’s making? What manner of man? Is his</li>
  <li>head worth a hat, or his chin worth a beard?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CELIA">
  <li>Nay, he hath but a little beard.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li class="number">Why, God will send more, if the man will be</li>
  <li>thankful: let me stay the growth of his beard, if</li>

<ol data-speaker="CELIA">
  <li>You must borrow me Gargantua’s mouth first: ’tis a</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CELIA">
  <li>It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the</li>
  <li>propositions of a lover; but take a taste of my</li>
  <li class="number">finding him, and relish it with good observance.</li>
  <li>I found him under a tree, like a dropped acorn.</li>

  <li>Do you hear, forester?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>Very well: what would you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>I pray you, what is’t o’clock?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>You should ask me what time o’ day: there’s no clock</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>Then there is no true lover in the forest; else</li>
  <li>sighing every minute and groaning every hour would</li>

  <li>And why not the swift foot of Time? had not that</li>

  <li>withal and who he stands still withal.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li class="number">I prithee, who doth he trot withal?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the</li>
  <li>contract of her marriage and the day it is</li>
  <li>solemnized: if the interim be but a se’nnight,</li>
  <li>Time’s pace is so hard that it seems the length of</li>
  <li class="number">seven year.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>Who ambles Time withal?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that</li>
  <li>hath not the gout, for the one sleeps easily because</li>
  <li>he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because</li>
  <li class="number">he feels no pain, the one lacking the burden of lean</li>
  <li>and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden</li>
  <li>of heavy tedious penury; these Time ambles withal.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>Who doth he gallop withal?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>With a thief to the gallows, for though he go as</li>
  <li class="number">softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>Who stays it still withal?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>With lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep between</li>
  <li>term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>Where dwell you, pretty youth?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li class="number">With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the</li>
  <li>skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>Are you native of this place?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>Your accent is something finer than you could</li>
  <li class="number">purchase in so removed a dwelling.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>I have been told so of many: but indeed an old</li>
  <li>religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was</li>
  <li>in his youth an inland man; one that knew courtship</li>
  <li>too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard</li>
  <li class="number">him read many lectures against it, and I thank God</li>
  <li>I am not a woman, to be touched with so many</li>
  <li>giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their</li>
  <li>whole sex withal.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>Can you remember any of the principal evils that he</li>
  <li class="number">laid to the charge of women?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>There were none principal; they were all like one</li>
  <li>another as half-pence are, every one fault seeming</li>
  <li>monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>I prithee, recount some of them.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li class="number">No, I will not cast away my physic but on those that</li>
  <li>are sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that</li>
  <li>abuses our young plants with carving ’Rosalind’ on</li>
  <li>their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies</li>
  <li>on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of</li>
  <li class="number">Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would</li>
  <li>give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the</li>
  <li>quotidian of love upon him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>I am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell me</li>
  <li>your remedy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li class="number">There is none of my uncle’s marks upon you: he</li>
  <li>taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage</li>
  <li>of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>What were his marks?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>A lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye and</li>
  <li class="number">sunken, which you have not, an unquestionable</li>
  <li>spirit, which you have not, a beard neglected,</li>
  <li>which you have not; but I pardon you for that, for</li>
  <li>simply your having in beard is a younger brother’s</li>
  <li>revenue: then your hose should be ungartered, your</li>
  <li class="number">bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe</li>
  <li>untied and every thing about you demonstrating a</li>
  <li>careless desolation; but you are no such man; you</li>
  <li>are rather point-device in your accoutrements as</li>
  <li>loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li class="number">Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>Me believe it! you may as soon make her that you</li>
  <li>love believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to</li>
  <li>do than to confess she does: that is one of the</li>
  <li>points in the which women still give the lie to</li>
  <li class="number">their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he</li>
  <li>that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind</li>
  <li>is so admired?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of</li>
  <li>Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li class="number">But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves</li>
  <li>as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and</li>
  <li>the reason why they are not so punished and cured</li>
  <li class="number">is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers</li>
  <li>are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>Did you ever cure any so?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me</li>
  <li>his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to</li>
  <li class="number">woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish</li>
  <li>youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing</li>
  <li>and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,</li>
  <li>inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every</li>
  <li>passion something and for no passion truly any</li>
  <li class="number">thing, as boys and women are for the most part</li>
  <li>cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe</li>
  <li>him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep</li>
  <li>for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor</li>
  <li>from his mad humour of love to a living humour of</li>
  <li class="number">madness; which was, to forswear the full stream of</li>
  <li>the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic.</li>
  <li>And thus I cured him; and this way will I take upon</li>
  <li>me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep’s</li>
  <li>heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li class="number">I would not be cured, youth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind</li>
  <li>and come every day to my cote and woo me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>Now, by the faith of my love, I will: tell me</li>
  <li>where it is.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li class="number">Go with me to it and I’ll show it you and by the way</li>
  <li>you shall tell me where in the forest you live.</li>
  <li>Will you go?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>With all my heart, good youth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>Nay you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you go?</li>

  <li>When a man’s verses cannot be understood, nor a</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUDREY">
  <li>I do not know what ’poetical’ is: is it honest in</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TOUCHSTONE">
  <li>No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most</li>

  <li>Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met: will you</li>

  <li>Will you be married, motley?</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JAQUES">
  <li>And will you, being a man of your breeding, be</li>
  <li>married under a bush like a beggar? Get you to</li>
  <li>church, and have a good priest that can tell you</li>
  <li class="number">what marriage is: this fellow will but join you</li>
  <li>together as they join wainscot; then one of you will</li>
  <li>prove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp, warp.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TOUCHSTONE">
  <li><span class="stage-direction">Aside</span>  I am not in the mind but I were better to be</li>
  <li>married of him than of another: for he is not like</li>
  <li class="number">to marry me well; and not being well married, it</li>
  <li>will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JAQUES">
  <li>Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.</li>

<ol data-speaker="TOUCHSTONE">
  <li>’Come, sweet Audrey:</li>
  <li>We must be married, or we must live in bawdry.</li>
  <li class="number">Farewell, good Master Oliver: not — </li>
  <li>O sweet Oliver,</li>

<ol data-speaker="PHEBE">
  <li>I would not be thy executioner:</li>
  <li>I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.</li>
  <li class="number">Thou tell’st me there is murder in mine eye:</li>
  <li>’Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,</li>
  <li>That eyes, that are the frail’st and softest things,</li>
  <li>Who shut their coward gates on atomies,</li>
  <li>Should be call’d tyrants, butchers, murderers!</li>
  <li class="number">Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;</li>

  <li>O dear Phebe,</li>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother,</li>

  <li>No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it:</li>

  <li>You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,</li>

  <li>You are a thousand times a properer man</li>

  <li class="number">That makes the world full of ill-favour’d children:</li>
  <li>’Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;</li>
  <li>And out of you she sees herself more proper</li>
  <li>Than any of her lineaments can show her.</li>
  <li>But, mistress, know yourself: down on your knees,</li>
  <li class="number">And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man’s love:</li>
  <li>For I must tell you friendly in your ear,</li>
  <li>Sell when you can: you are not for all markets:</li>

  <li>Why, that were covetousness.</li>

  <li>I will endure, and I’ll employ thee too:</li>
  <li class="number">But do not look for further recompense</li>
  <li>Than thine own gladness that thou art employ’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SILVIUS">
  <li>So holy and so perfect is my love,</li>
  <li>And I in such a poverty of grace,</li>
  <li>That I shall think it a most plenteous crop</li>
  <li class="number">To glean the broken ears after the man</li>
  <li>That the main harvest reaps: loose now and then</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SILVIUS">
  <li>Not very well, but I have met him oft;</li>
  <li class="number">And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds</li>
  <li>That the old carlot once was master of.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PHEBE">
  <li>Think not I love him, though I ask for him:</li>
  <li>’Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well;</li>
  <li>But what care I for words? yet words do well</li>
  <li class="number">When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.</li>
  <li>It is a pretty youth: not very pretty:</li>
  <li>But, sure, he’s proud, and yet his pride becomes him:</li>
  <li>He’ll make a proper man: the best thing in him</li>
  <li>Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue</li>
  <li class="number">Did make offence his eye did heal it up.</li>
  <li>He is not very tall; yet for his years he’s tall:</li>
  <li>His leg is but so so; and yet ’tis well:</li>
  <li>There was a pretty redness in his lip,</li>
  <li>A little riper and more lusty red</li>
  <li class="number">Than that mix’d in his cheek; ’twas just the difference</li>
  <li>Between the constant red and mingled damask.</li>
  <li>There be some women, Silvius, had they mark’d him</li>
  <li>In parcels as I did, would have gone near</li>
  <li>To fall in love with him; but, for my part,</li>
  <li class="number">I love him not nor hate him not; and yet</li>
  <li>I have more cause to hate him than to love him:</li>
  <li>For what had he to do to chide at me?</li>
  <li>He said mine eyes were black and my hair black:</li>
  <li>And, now I am remember’d, scorn’d at me:</li>
  <li class="number">I marvel why I answer’d not again:</li>
  <li>But that’s all one; omittance is no quittance.</li>
  <li>I’ll write to him a very taunting letter,</li>
  <li>And thou shalt bear it: wilt thou, Silvius?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SILVIUS">
  <li>Phebe, with all my heart.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PHEBE">
  <li class="number">I’ll write it straight;</li>
  <li>The matter’s in my head and in my heart:</li>

  <li>Then in mine own person I die.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is</li>
  <li>almost six thousand years old, and in all this time</li>
  <li>there was not any man died in his own person,</li>
  <li class="number">videlicit, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains</li>
  <li>dashed out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he</li>
  <li>could to die before, and he is one of the patterns</li>
  <li>of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair</li>
  <li>year, though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been</li>
  <li class="number">for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he went</li>
  <li>but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being</li>
  <li>taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish</li>
  <li>coroners of that age found it was ’Hero of Sestos.’</li>
  <li>But these are all lies: men have died from time to</li>
  <li class="number">time and worms have eaten them, but not for love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind,</li>
  <li>for, I protest, her frown might kill me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now</li>
  <li>I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on</li>
  <li class="number">disposition, and ask me what you will. I will grant</li>
  <li>it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>Then love me, Rosalind.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>And wilt thou have me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li class="number">Ay, and twenty such.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>What sayest thou?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>Are you not good?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>I hope so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?</li>
  <li class="number">Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.</li>
  <li>Give me your hand, Orlando. What do you say, sister?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>Pray thee, marry us.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CELIA">
  <li>I cannot say the words.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>You must begin, ’Will you, Orlando — ’</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CELIA">
  <li class="number">Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>I will.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>Ay, but when?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>Why now; as fast as she can marry us.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>Then you must say ’I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.’</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li class="number">I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>I might ask you for your commission; but I do take</li>
  <li>thee, Orlando, for my husband: there’s a girl goes</li>
  <li>before the priest; and certainly a woman’s thought</li>
  <li>runs before her actions.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li class="number">So do all thoughts; they are winged.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>Now tell me how long you would have her after you</li>
  <li>have possessed her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>For ever and a day.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>Say ’a day,’ without the ’ever.’ No, no, Orlando;</li>
  <li class="number">men are April when they woo, December when they wed:</li>
  <li>maids are May when they are maids, but the sky</li>
  <li>changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous</li>
  <li>of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,</li>
  <li>more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more</li>
  <li class="number">new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires</li>
  <li>than a monkey: I will weep for nothing, like Diana</li>
  <li>in the fountain, and I will do that when you are</li>
  <li>disposed to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and</li>
  <li>that when thou art inclined to sleep.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li class="number">But will my Rosalind do so?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>By my life, she will do as I do.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>O, but she is wise.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>Or else she could not have the wit to do this: the</li>
  <li>wiser, the waywarder: make the doors upon a woman’s</li>
  <li class="number">wit and it will out at the casement; shut that and</li>
  <li>’twill out at the key-hole; stop that, ’twill fly</li>
  <li>with the smoke out at the chimney.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say</li>
  <li>’Wit, whither wilt?’</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li class="number">Nay, you might keep that cheque for it till you met</li>
  <li>your wife’s wit going to your neighbour’s bed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>And what wit could wit have to excuse that?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall</li>
  <li>never take her without her answer, unless you take</li>
  <li class="number">her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot</li>
  <li>make her fault her husband’s occasion, let her</li>
  <li>never nurse her child herself, for she will breed</li>
  <li>it like a fool!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li class="number">Alas! dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>I must attend the duke at dinner: by two o’clock I</li>
  <li>will be with thee again.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>Ay, go your ways, go your ways; I knew what you</li>
  <li>would prove: my friends told me as much, and I</li>
  <li class="number">thought no less: that flattering tongue of yours</li>
  <li>won me: ’tis but one cast away, and so, come,</li>
  <li>death! Two o’clock is your hour?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>Ay, sweet Rosalind.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">
  <li>By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend</li>
  <li class="number">me, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous,</li>
  <li>if you break one jot of your promise or come one</li>
  <li>minute behind your hour, I will think you the most</li>
  <li>pathetical break-promise and the most hollow lover</li>
  <li>and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that</li>
  <li class="number">may be chosen out of the gross band of the</li>
  <li>unfaithful: therefore beware my censure and keep</li>
  <li>your promise.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ORLANDO">
  <li>With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my</li>
  <li>Rosalind: so adieu.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALIND">

  <li>Patience herself would startle at this letter</li>

  <li class="number">Lo, what befell! he threw his eye aside,</li>
  <li>And mark what object did present itself:</li>
  <li>Under an oak, whose boughs were moss’d with age</li>
  <li>And high top bald with dry antiquity,</li>
  <li>A wretched ragged man, o’ergrown with hair,</li>
  <li class="number">Lay sleeping on his back: about his neck</li>
  <li>A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself,</li>
  <li>Who with her head nimble in threats approach’d</li>
  <li>The opening of his mouth; but suddenly,</li>
  <li>Seeing Orlando, it unlink’d itself,</li>
  <li class="number">And with indented glides did slip away</li>
  <li>Into a bush: under which bush’s shade</li>
  <li>A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,</li>
  <li>Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,</li>
  <li>When that the sleeping man should stir; for ’tis</li>

  <li>This seen, Orlando did approach the man</li>
  <li>And found it was his brother, his elder brother.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CELIA">
  <li>O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;</li>

  <li class="number">Food to the suck’d and hungry lioness?</li>

  <li>Twice did he turn his back and purposed so;</li>
  <li>But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,</li>

  <li class="number">Who quickly fell before him: in which hurtling</li>
  <li>From miserable slumber I awaked.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CELIA">

  <li>By and by.</li>

  <li>In brief, he led me to the gentle duke,</li>
  <li>Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,</li>
  <li class="number">Committing me unto my brother’s love;</li>
  <li>Who led me instantly unto his cave,</li>
  <li>There stripp’d himself, and here upon his arm</li>
  <li>The lioness had torn some flesh away,</li>
  <li>Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted</li>
  <li class="number">And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.</li>
  <li>Brief, I recover’d him, bound up his wound;</li>
  <li>And, after some small space, being strong at heart,</li>
  <li>He sent me hither, stranger as I am,</li>
  <li>To tell this story, that you might excuse</li>
  <li class="number">His broken promise, and to give this napkin</li>
  <li>Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth</li>

  <li>If I sent him word again ’it was not well cut,’ he</li>

  <li>this is called the Quip Modest. If again ’it was</li>
  <li>not well cut,’ he disabled my judgment: this is</li>
  <li>called the Reply Churlish. If again ’it was not</li>
  <li>well cut,’ he would answer, I spake not true: this</li>
  <li class="number">is called the Reproof Valiant. If again ’it was not</li>
  <li>well cut,’ he would say I lied: this is called the</li>
  <li>Counter-cheque Quarrelsome: and so to the Lie</li>

  <li>O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book; as you have</li>
  <li class="number">books for good manners: I will name you the degrees.</li>
  <li>The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the</li>
  <li>Quip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the</li>
  <li>fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the</li>
  <li>Countercheque Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with</li>
  <li class="number">Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. All</li>
  <li>these you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may</li>
  <li>avoid that too, with an If. I knew when seven</li>
  <li>justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the</li>
  <li>parties were met themselves, one of them thought but</li>
  <li class="number">of an If, as, ’If you said so, then I said so;’ and</li>
  <li>they shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is the</li>
  <li>only peacemaker; much virtue in If.</li>
