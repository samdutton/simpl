  <li>As by your high imperial majesty</li>
  <li>I had in charge at my depart for France,</li>
  <li>As procurator to your excellence,</li>

  <li class="number">So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,</li>

  <li>Seven earls, twelve barons and twenty reverend bishops,</li>
  <li>I have perform’d my task and was espoused:</li>
  <li class="number">And humbly now upon my bended knee,</li>
  <li>In sight of England and her lordly peers,</li>
  <li>Deliver up my title in the queen</li>
  <li>To your most gracious hands, that are the substance</li>
  <li>Of that great shadow I did represent;</li>
  <li class="number">The happiest gift that ever marquess gave,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">
  <li>Suffolk, arise. Welcome, Queen Margaret:</li>
  <li>I can express no kinder sign of love</li>
  <li>Than this kind kiss. O Lord, that lends me life,</li>
  <li class="number">Lend me a heart replete with thankfulness!</li>
  <li>For thou hast given me in this beauteous face</li>
  <li>A world of earthly blessings to my soul,</li>
  <li>If sympathy of love unite our thoughts.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN MARGARET">
  <li>Great King of England and my gracious lord,</li>

  <li>Pardon me, gracious lord;</li>

  <li>We here discharge your grace from being regent</li>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li class="number">Brave peers of England, pillars of the state,</li>
  <li>To you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief,</li>
  <li>Your grief, the common grief of all the land.</li>
  <li>What! did my brother Henry spend his youth,</li>
  <li>His valour, coin and people, in the wars?</li>
  <li class="number">Did he so often lodge in open field,</li>
  <li>In winter’s cold and summer’s parching heat,</li>
  <li>To conquer France, his true inheritance?</li>
  <li>And did my brother Bedford toil his wits,</li>
  <li>To keep by policy what Henry got?</li>
  <li class="number">Have you yourselves, Somerset, Buckingham,</li>
  <li>Brave York, Salisbury, and victorious Warwick,</li>
  <li>Received deep scars in France and Normandy?</li>
  <li>Or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself,</li>
  <li>With all the learned council of the realm,</li>
  <li class="number">Studied so long, sat in the council-house</li>
  <li>Early and late, debating to and fro</li>
  <li>How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,</li>
  <li>And had his highness in his infancy</li>
  <li>Crowned in Paris in despite of foes?</li>
  <li class="number">And shall these labours and these honours die?</li>
  <li>Shall Henry’s conquest, Bedford’s vigilance,</li>
  <li>Your deeds of war and all our counsel die?</li>
  <li>O peers of England, shameful is this league!</li>
  <li>Fatal this marriage, cancelling your fame,</li>
  <li class="number">Blotting your names from books of memory,</li>
  <li>Razing the characters of your renown,</li>
  <li>Defacing monuments of conquer’d France,</li>
  <li>Undoing all, as all had never been!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CARDINAL">
  <li>Nephew, what means this passionate discourse,</li>
  <li class="number">This peroration with such circumstance?</li>
  <li>For France, ’tis ours; and we will keep it still.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>Ay, uncle, we will keep it, if we can;</li>
  <li>But now it is impossible we should:</li>
  <li>Suffolk, the new-made duke that rules the roast,</li>
  <li class="number">Hath given the duchy of Anjou and Maine</li>
  <li>Unto the poor King Reignier, whose large style</li>
  <li>Agrees not with the leanness of his purse.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALISBURY">
  <li>Now, by the death of Him that died for all,</li>
  <li>These counties were the keys of Normandy.</li>
  <li class="number">But wherefore weeps Warwick, my valiant son?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>For grief that they are past recovery:</li>
  <li>For, were there hope to conquer them again,</li>
  <li>My sword should shed hot blood, mine eyes no tears.</li>
  <li>Anjou and Maine! myself did win them both;</li>
  <li class="number">Those provinces these arms of mine did conquer:</li>
  <li>And are the cities, that I got with wounds,</li>
  <li>Delivered up again with peaceful words?</li>
  <li>Mort Dieu!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li>For Suffolk’s duke, may he be suffocate,</li>
  <li class="number">That dims the honour of this warlike isle!</li>
  <li>France should have torn and rent my very heart,</li>
  <li>Before I would have yielded to this league.</li>
  <li>I never read but England’s kings have had</li>
  <li>Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives:</li>
  <li class="number">And our King Henry gives away his own,</li>
  <li>To match with her that brings no vantages.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>A proper jest, and never heard before,</li>
  <li>That Suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth</li>
  <li>For costs and charges in transporting her!</li>
  <li class="number">She should have stayed in France and starved</li>
  <li>in France, Before — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CARDINAL">
  <li>My Lord of Gloucester, now ye grow too hot:</li>
  <li>It was the pleasure of my lord the King.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>My Lord of Winchester, I know your mind;</li>
  <li class="number">’Tis not my speeches that you do mislike,</li>
  <li>But ’tis my presence that doth trouble ye.</li>
  <li>Rancour will out: proud prelate, in thy face</li>
  <li>I see thy fury: if I longer stay,</li>
  <li>We shall begin our ancient bickerings.</li>
  <li class="number">Lordings, farewell; and say, when I am gone,</li>
  <li>I prophesied France will be lost ere long.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<ol data-speaker="CARDINAL">
  <li>So, there goes our protector in a rage.</li>
  <li>’Tis known to you he is mine enemy,</li>
  <li>Nay, more, an enemy unto you all,</li>
  <li class="number">And no great friend, I fear me, to the king.</li>
  <li>Consider, lords, he is the next of blood,</li>
  <li>And heir apparent to the English crown:</li>
  <li>Had Henry got an empire by his marriage,</li>
  <li>And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west,</li>
  <li class="number">There’s reason he should be displeased at it.</li>
  <li>Look to it, lords! let not his smoothing words</li>
  <li>Bewitch your hearts; be wise and circumspect.</li>
  <li>What though the common people favour him,</li>
  <li>Calling him ’Humphrey, the good Duke of</li>
  <li class="number">Gloucester,’</li>
  <li>Clapping their hands, and crying with loud voice,</li>
  <li>’Jesu maintain your royal excellence!’</li>
  <li>With ’God preserve the good Duke Humphrey!’</li>
  <li>I fear me, lords, for all this flattering gloss,</li>
  <li class="number">He will be found a dangerous protector.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCKINGHAM">
  <li>Why should he, then, protect our sovereign,</li>
  <li>He being of age to govern of himself?</li>
  <li>Cousin of Somerset, join you with me,</li>
  <li>And all together, with the Duke of Suffolk,</li>
  <li class="number">We’ll quickly hoise Duke Humphrey from his seat.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CARDINAL">
  <li>This weighty business will not brook delay:</li>
  <li>I’ll to the Duke of Suffolk presently.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<ol data-speaker="SOMERSET">
  <li>Cousin of Buckingham, though Humphrey’s pride</li>
  <li>And greatness of his place be grief to us,</li>
  <li class="number">Yet let us watch the haughty cardinal:</li>
  <li>His insolence is more intolerable</li>
  <li>Than all the princes in the land beside:</li>
  <li>If Gloucester be displaced, he’ll be protector.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCKINGHAM">
  <li>Or thou or I, Somerset, will be protector,</li>
  <li class="number">Despite Duke Humphrey or the cardinal.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt BUCKINGHAM and SOMERSET</div>

<ol data-speaker="SALISBURY">
  <li>Pride went before, ambition follows him.</li>
  <li>While these do labour for their own preferment,</li>
  <li>Behoves it us to labour for the realm.</li>
  <li>I never saw but Humphrey Duke of Gloucester</li>
  <li class="number">Did bear him like a noble gentleman.</li>
  <li>Oft have I seen the haughty cardinal,</li>
  <li>More like a soldier than a man o’ the church,</li>
  <li>As stout and proud as he were lord of all,</li>
  <li>Swear like a ruffian and demean himself</li>
  <li class="number">Unlike the ruler of a commonweal.</li>
  <li>Warwick, my son, the comfort of my age,</li>
  <li>Thy deeds, thy plainness and thy housekeeping,</li>
  <li>Hath won the greatest favour of the commons,</li>
  <li>Excepting none but good Duke Humphrey:</li>
  <li class="number">And, brother York, thy acts in Ireland,</li>
  <li>In bringing them to civil discipline,</li>
  <li>Thy late exploits done in the heart of France,</li>
  <li>When thou wert regent for our sovereign,</li>
  <li>Have made thee fear’d and honour’d of the people:</li>
  <li class="number">Join we together, for the public good,</li>
  <li>In what we can, to bridle and suppress</li>
  <li>The pride of Suffolk and the cardinal,</li>
  <li>With Somerset’s and Buckingham’s ambition;</li>
  <li>And, as we may, cherish Duke Humphrey’s deeds,</li>
  <li class="number">While they do tend the profit of the land.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>So God help Warwick, as he loves the land,</li>
  <li>And common profit of his country!</li>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li><span class="stage-direction">Aside</span>  And so says York, for he hath greatest cause.</li>

  <li>Then let’s make haste away, and look unto the main.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li class="number">Unto the main! O father, Maine is lost;</li>
  <li>That Maine which by main force Warwick did win,</li>
  <li>And would have kept so long as breath did last!</li>
  <li>Main chance, father, you meant; but I meant Maine,</li>
  <li>Which I will win from France, or else be slain,</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt WARWICK and SALISBURY</div>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li class="number">Anjou and Maine are given to the French;</li>
  <li>Paris is lost; the state of Normandy</li>
  <li>Stands on a tickle point, now they are gone:</li>
  <li>Suffolk concluded on the articles,</li>
  <li>The peers agreed, and Henry was well pleased</li>
  <li class="number">To change two dukedoms for a duke’s fair daughter.</li>
  <li>I cannot blame them all: what is’t to them?</li>
  <li>’Tis thine they give away, and not their own.</li>
  <li>Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage</li>
  <li>And purchase friends and give to courtezans,</li>
  <li class="number">Still revelling like lords till all be gone;</li>
  <li>While as the silly owner of the goods</li>
  <li>Weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands</li>
  <li>And shakes his head and trembling stands aloof,</li>
  <li>While all is shared and all is borne away,</li>
  <li class="number">Ready to starve and dare not touch his own:</li>
  <li>So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue,</li>
  <li>While his own lands are bargain’d for and sold.</li>
  <li>Methinks the realms of England, France and Ireland</li>
  <li>Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood</li>
  <li class="number">As did the fatal brand Althaea burn’d</li>
  <li>Unto the prince’s heart of Calydon.</li>
  <li>Anjou and Maine both given unto the French!</li>
  <li>Cold news for me, for I had hope of France,</li>
  <li>Even as I have of fertile England’s soil.</li>
  <li class="number">A day will come when York shall claim his own;</li>
  <li>And therefore I will take the Nevils’ parts</li>
  <li>And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey,</li>
  <li>And, when I spy advantage, claim the crown,</li>
  <li>For that’s the golden mark I seek to hit:</li>
  <li class="number">Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right,</li>
  <li>Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist,</li>
  <li>Nor wear the diadem upon his head,</li>
  <li>Whose church-like humours fits not for a crown.</li>
  <li>Then, York, be still awhile, till time do serve:</li>
  <li class="number">Watch thou and wake when others be asleep,</li>
  <li>To pry into the secrets of the state;</li>
  <li>Till Henry, surfeiting in joys of love,</li>
  <li>With his new bride and England’s dear-bought queen,</li>
  <li>And Humphrey with the peers be fall’n at jars:</li>
  <li class="number">Then will I raise aloft the milk-white rose,</li>
  <li>With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed;</li>
  <li>And in my standard bear the arms of York</li>
  <li>To grapple with the house of Lancaster;</li>
  <li>And, force perforce, I’ll make him yield the crown,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose bookish rule hath pull’d fair England down.</li>

  <li>I thought King Henry had resembled thee</li>

  <li>His weapons holy saws of sacred writ,</li>
  <li>His study is his tilt-yard, and his loves</li>

  <li>Lord Buckingham, methinks, you watch’d her well:</li>

<h3>SCENE I.  Saint Alban’s.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET, GLOUCESTER,
CARDINAL, and SUFFOLK, with Falconers halloing</div>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN MARGARET">
  <li>Believe me, lords, for flying at the brook,</li>
  <li>I saw not better sport these seven years’ day:</li>
  <li>Yet, by your leave, the wind was very high;</li>
  <li>And, ten to one, old Joan had not gone out.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">
  <li class="number">But what a point, my lord, your falcon made,</li>
  <li>And what a pitch she flew above the rest!</li>
  <li>To see how God in all his creatures works!</li>
  <li>Yea, man and birds are fain of climbing high.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUFFOLK">
  <li>No marvel, an it like your majesty,</li>
  <li class="number">My lord protector’s hawks do tower so well;</li>
  <li>They know their master loves to be aloft,</li>
  <li>And bears his thoughts above his falcon’s pitch.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>My lord, ’tis but a base ignoble mind</li>
  <li>That mounts no higher than a bird can soar.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CARDINAL">
  <li class="number">I thought as much; he would be above the clouds.</li>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>Ay, my lord cardinal? how think you by that?</li>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>What, cardinal, is your priesthood grown peremptory?</li>
  <li>Tantaene animis coelestibus irae?</li>
  <li class="number">Churchmen so hot? good uncle, hide such malice;</li>
  <li>With such holiness can you do it?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUFFOLK">
  <li>No malice, sir; no more than well becomes</li>
  <li>So good a quarrel and so bad a peer.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>As who, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUFFOLK">
  <li class="number">Why, as you, my lord,</li>

  <li>Believe me, cousin Gloucester,</li>

  <li>Talking of hawking; nothing else, my lord.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Aside to CARDINAL</li>
  <li>Now, by God’s mother, priest, I’ll shave your crown for this,</li>

  <li>How irksome is this music to my heart!</li>

  <li>I pray, my lords, let me compound this strife.</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter a Townsman of Saint Alban’s, crying ’A miracle!’</div>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN MARGARET">
  <li>Tell me, good fellow, camest thou here by chance,</li>

<ol data-speaker="SIMPCOX">
  <li>God knows, of pure devotion; being call’d</li>
  <li>A hundred times and oftener, in my sleep,</li>
  <li class="number">By good Saint Alban; who said, ’Simpcox, come,</li>
  <li>Come, offer at my shrine, and I will help thee.’</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Wife">
  <li>Most true, forsooth; and many time and oft</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIMPCOX">
  <li class="number">Ay, God Almighty help me!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUFFOLK">
  <li>How camest thou so?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIMPCOX">
  <li>A fall off of a tree.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Wife">
  <li>A plum-tree, master.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>How long hast thou been blind?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIMPCOX">
  <li class="number">Born so, master.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>What, and wouldst climb a tree?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIMPCOX">
  <li>But that in all my life, when I was a youth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Wife">
  <li>Too true; and bought his climbing very dear.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>Mass, thou lovedst plums well, that wouldst</li>
  <li class="number">venture so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIMPCOX">
  <li>Alas, good master, my wife desired some damsons,</li>
  <li>And made me climb, with danger of my life.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>A subtle knave! but yet it shall not serve.</li>
  <li>Let me see thine eyes: wink now: now open them:</li>
  <li class="number">In my opinion yet thou seest not well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIMPCOX">
  <li>Yes, master, clear as day, I thank God and</li>
  <li>Saint Alban.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>Say’st thou me so? What colour is this cloak of?</li>

<ol data-speaker="SIMPCOX">
  <li>Red, master; red as blood.</li>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li class="number">Why, that’s well said. What colour is my gown of?</li>

  <li>Black, forsooth: coal-black as jet.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">
  <li>Why, then, thou know’st what colour jet is of?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUFFOLK">
  <li>And yet, I think, jet did he never see.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>But cloaks and gowns, before this day, a many.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Wife">
  <li class="number">Never, before this day, in all his life.</li>

<ol data-speaker="SIMPCOX">
  <li>Saunder Simpcox, an if it please you, master.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>Then, Saunder, sit there, the lyingest knave in</li>
  <li class="number">Christendom. If thou hadst been born blind, thou</li>
  <li>mightest as well have known all our names as thus to</li>
  <li>name the several colours we do wear. Sight may</li>
  <li>distinguish of colours, but suddenly to nominate them</li>
  <li>all, it is impossible. My lords, Saint Alban here</li>
  <li class="number">hath done a miracle; and would ye not think his</li>
  <li>cunning to be great, that could restore this cripple</li>
  <li>to his legs again?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIMPCOX">
  <li>O master, that you could!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>My masters of Saint Alban’s, have you not beadles in</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  London. YORK’S garden.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter YORK, SALISBURY, and WARWICK</div>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li>Now, my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick,</li>
  <li>Our simple supper ended, give me leave</li>
  <li>In this close walk to satisfy myself,</li>
  <li>In craving your opinion of my title,</li>
  <li class="number">Which is infallible, to England’s crown.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALISBURY">
  <li>My lord, I long to hear it at full.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>Sweet York, begin: and if thy claim be good,</li>
  <li>The Nevils are thy subjects to command.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li>Then thus:</li>
  <li class="number">Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:</li>
  <li>The first, Edward the Black Prince, Prince of Wales;</li>
  <li>The second, William of Hatfield, and the third,</li>
  <li>Lionel Duke of Clarence: next to whom</li>
  <li>Was John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster;</li>
  <li class="number">The fifth was Edmund Langley, Duke of York;</li>
  <li>The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester;</li>
  <li>William of Windsor was the seventh and last.</li>
  <li>Edward the Black Prince died before his father</li>
  <li>And left behind him Richard, his only son,</li>
  <li class="number">Who after Edward the Third’s death reign’d as king;</li>
  <li>Till Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster,</li>
  <li>The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt,</li>
  <li>Crown’d by the name of Henry the Fourth,</li>
  <li>Seized on the realm, deposed the rightful king,</li>
  <li class="number">Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came,</li>
  <li>And him to Pomfret; where, as all you know,</li>
  <li>Harmless Richard was murder’d traitorously.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>Father, the duke hath told the truth:</li>
  <li>Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li class="number">Which now they hold by force and not by right;</li>
  <li>For Richard, the first son’s heir, being dead,</li>
  <li>The issue of the next son should have reign’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALISBURY">
  <li>But William of Hatfield died without an heir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li>The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose line</li>
  <li class="number">I claimed the crown, had issue, Philippe, a daughter,</li>
  <li>Who married Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March:</li>
  <li>Edmund had issue, Roger Earl of March;</li>
  <li>Roger had issue, Edmund, Anne and Eleanor.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALISBURY">
  <li>This Edmund, in the reign of Bolingbroke,</li>
  <li class="number">As I have read, laid claim unto the crown;</li>
  <li>And, but for Owen Glendower, had been king,</li>
  <li>Who kept him in captivity till he died.</li>
  <li>But to the rest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li>His eldest sister, Anne,</li>
  <li class="number">My mother, being heir unto the crown</li>
  <li>Married Richard Earl of Cambridge; who was son</li>
  <li>To Edmund Langley, Edward the Third’s fifth son.</li>

  <li>To Roger Earl of March, who was the son</li>
  <li class="number">Of Edmund Mortimer, who married Philippe,</li>
  <li>Sole daughter unto Lionel Duke of Clarence:</li>
  <li>So, if the issue of the elder son</li>
  <li>Succeed before the younger, I am king.</li>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>What plain proceeding is more plain than this?</li>
  <li class="number">Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt,</li>
  <li>The fourth son; York claims it from the third.</li>
  <li>Till Lionel’s issue fails, his should not reign:</li>
  <li>It fails not yet, but flourishes in thee</li>
  <li>And in thy sons, fair slips of such a stock.</li>
  <li class="number">Then, father Salisbury, kneel we together;</li>
  <li>And in this private plot be we the first</li>

  <li>And that’s not suddenly to be perform’d,</li>
  <li>But with advice and silent secrecy.</li>

  <li>How insolent of late he is become,</li>
  <li>How proud, how peremptory, and unlike himself?</li>
  <li>We know the time since he was mild and affable,</li>
  <li class="number">And if we did but glance a far-off look,</li>
  <li>Immediately he was upon his knee,</li>
  <li>That all the court admired him for submission:</li>

  <li class="number">He knits his brow and shows an angry eye,</li>

  <li>Small curs are not regarded when they grin;</li>
  <li>But great men tremble when the lion roars;</li>
  <li class="number">And Humphrey is no little man in England.</li>
  <li>First note that he is near you in descent,</li>
  <li>And should you fall, he as the next will mount.</li>
  <li>Me seemeth then it is no policy,</li>
  <li>Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears</li>
  <li class="number">And his advantage following your decease,</li>
  <li>That he should come about your royal person</li>

  <li>Now ’tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted;</li>
  <li>Suffer them now, and they’ll o’ergrow the garden</li>

  <li>The reverent care I bear unto my lord</li>
  <li class="number">Made me collect these dangers in the duke.</li>
  <li>If it be fond, call it a woman’s fear;</li>

  <li>Yet, by reputing of his high descent,</li>
  <li>As next the king he was successive heir,</li>
  <li class="number">And such high vaunts of his nobility,</li>
  <li>Did instigate the bedlam brain-sick duchess</li>

  <li class="number">Why, ’tis well known that, whiles I was</li>

  <li>Foul subornation is predominant</li>

  <li>I know their complot is to have my life,</li>

  <li>The envious load that lies upon his heart;</li>

  <li>Causeless have laid disgraces on my head,</li>
  <li class="number">And with your best endeavour have stirr’d up</li>
  <li>My liefest liege to be mine enemy:</li>
  <li>Ay, all you have laid your heads together — </li>
  <li>Myself had notice of your conventicles — </li>
  <li>And all to make away my guiltless life.</li>
  <li class="number">I shall not want false witness to condemn me,</li>

<h3>SCENE I.  The coast of Kent.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Alarum. Fight at sea. Ordnance goes off. Enter a
Captain, a Master, a Master’s-mate, WALTER WHITMORE,
and others; with them SUFFOLK, and others, prisoners</div>

<ol data-speaker="Captain">
  <li>The gaudy, blabbing and remorseful day</li>
  <li>Is crept into the bosom of the sea;</li>
  <li>And now loud-howling wolves arouse the jades</li>
  <li>That drag the tragic melancholy night;</li>
  <li class="number">Who, with their drowsy, slow and flagging wings,</li>
  <li>Clip dead men’s graves and from their misty jaws</li>
  <li>Breathe foul contagious darkness in the air.</li>
  <li>Therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize;</li>
  <li>For, whilst our pinnace anchors in the Downs,</li>
  <li class="number">Here shall they make their ransom on the sand,</li>
  <li>Or with their blood stain this discolour’d shore.</li>
  <li>Master, this prisoner freely give I thee;</li>
  <li>And thou that art his mate, make boot of this;</li>
  <li>The other, Walter Whitmore, is thy share.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Gentleman">
  <li class="number">What is my ransom, master? let me know.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Master">
  <li>A thousand crowns, or else lay down your head.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Master’s-Mate">
  <li>And so much shall you give, or off goes yours.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Captain">
  <li>What, think you much to pay two thousand crowns,</li>
  <li>And bear the name and port of gentlemen?</li>
  <li class="number">Cut both the villains’ throats; for die you shall:</li>
  <li>The lives of those which we have lost in fight</li>
  <li>Be counterpoised with such a petty sum!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Gentleman">
  <li>I’ll give it, sir; and therefore spare my life.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Gentleman">
  <li>And so will I and write home for it straight.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WHITMORE">
  <li class="number">I lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard,</li>
  <li>And therefore to revenge it, shalt thou die;</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">To SUFFOLK</li>
  <li>And so should these, if I might have my will.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Captain">
  <li>Be not so rash; take ransom, let him live.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUFFOLK">
  <li>Look on my George; I am a gentleman:</li>
  <li class="number">Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WHITMORE">
  <li>And so am I; my name is Walter Whitmore.</li>
  <li>How now! why start’st thou? what, doth</li>
  <li>death affright?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUFFOLK">
  <li>Thy name affrights me, in whose sound is death.</li>
  <li class="number">A cunning man did calculate my birth</li>
  <li>And told me that by water I should die:</li>
  <li>Yet let not this make thee be bloody-minded;</li>
  <li>Thy name is Gaultier, being rightly sounded.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WHITMORE">
  <li>Gaultier or Walter, which it is, I care not:</li>
  <li class="number">Never yet did base dishonour blur our name,</li>
  <li>But with our sword we wiped away the blot;</li>
  <li>Therefore, when merchant-like I sell revenge,</li>
  <li>Broke be my sword, my arms torn and defaced,</li>
  <li>And I proclaim’d a coward through the world!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUFFOLK">
  <li class="number">Stay, Whitmore; for thy prisoner is a prince,</li>
  <li>The Duke of Suffolk, William de la Pole.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WHITMORE">
  <li>The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUFFOLK">
  <li>Ay, but these rags are no part of the duke:</li>
  <li>Jove sometimes went disguised, and why not I?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Captain">
  <li class="number">But Jove was never slain, as thou shalt be.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUFFOLK">
  <li>Obscure and lowly swain, King Henry’s blood,</li>
  <li>The honourable blood of Lancaster,</li>
  <li>Must not be shed by such a jaded groom.</li>
  <li>Hast thou not kiss’d thy hand and held my stirrup?</li>
  <li class="number">Bare-headed plodded by my foot-cloth mule</li>
  <li>And thought thee happy when I shook my head?</li>
  <li>How often hast thou waited at my cup,</li>
  <li>Fed from my trencher, kneel’d down at the board.</li>
  <li>When I have feasted with Queen Margaret?</li>
  <li class="number">Remember it and let it make thee crest-fall’n,</li>
  <li>Ay, and allay this thy abortive pride;</li>
  <li>How in our voiding lobby hast thou stood</li>
  <li>And duly waited for my coming forth?</li>
  <li>This hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf,</li>
  <li class="number">And therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WHITMORE">
  <li>Speak, captain, shall I stab the forlorn swain?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Captain">
  <li>First let my words stab him, as he hath me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUFFOLK">
  <li>Base slave, thy words are blunt and so art thou.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Captain">
  <li>Convey him hence and on our longboat’s side</li>
  <li class="number">Strike off his head.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUFFOLK">
  <li>Thou darest not, for thy own.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Captain">
  <li>Yes, Pole.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUFFOLK">
  <li>Pole!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Captain">
  <li>Pool! Sir Pool! lord!</li>
  <li class="number">Ay, kennel, puddle, sink; whose filth and dirt</li>
  <li>Troubles the silver spring where England drinks.</li>
  <li>Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth</li>
  <li>For swallowing the treasure of the realm:</li>
  <li>Thy lips that kiss’d the queen shall sweep the ground;</li>
  <li class="number">And thou that smiledst at good Duke Humphrey’s death,</li>
  <li>Against the senseless winds shalt grin in vain,</li>
  <li>Who in contempt shall hiss at thee again:</li>
  <li>And wedded be thou to the hags of hell,</li>
  <li>For daring to affy a mighty lord</li>
  <li class="number">Unto the daughter of a worthless king,</li>
  <li>Having neither subject, wealth, nor diadem.</li>
  <li>By devilish policy art thou grown great,</li>
  <li>And, like ambitious Sylla, overgorged</li>
  <li>With gobbets of thy mother’s bleeding heart.</li>
  <li class="number">By thee Anjou and Maine were sold to France,</li>
  <li>The false revolting Normans thorough thee</li>
  <li>Disdain to call us lord, and Picardy</li>
  <li>Hath slain their governors, surprised our forts,</li>
  <li>And sent the ragged soldiers wounded home.</li>
  <li class="number">The princely Warwick, and the Nevils all,</li>
  <li>Whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain,</li>
  <li>As hating thee, are rising up in arms:</li>
  <li>And now the house of York, thrust from the crown</li>
  <li>By shameful murder of a guiltless king</li>
  <li class="number">And lofty proud encroaching tyranny,</li>
  <li>Burns with revenging fire; whose hopeful colours</li>
  <li>Advance our half-faced sun, striving to shine,</li>
  <li>Under the which is writ ’Invitis nubibus.’</li>
  <li>The commons here in Kent are up in arms:</li>
  <li class="number">And, to conclude, reproach and beggary</li>
  <li>Is crept into the palace of our king.</li>
  <li>And all by thee. Away! convey him hence.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUFFOLK">
  <li>O that I were a god, to shoot forth thunder</li>
  <li>Upon these paltry, servile, abject drudges!</li>
  <li class="number">Small things make base men proud: this villain here,</li>
  <li>Being captain of a pinnace, threatens more</li>
  <li>Than Bargulus the strong Illyrian pirate.</li>
  <li>Drones suck not eagles’ blood but rob beehives:</li>
  <li>It is impossible that I should die</li>
  <li class="number">By such a lowly vassal as thyself.</li>
  <li>Thy words move rage and not remorse in me:</li>
  <li>I go of message from the queen to France;</li>
  <li>I charge thee waft me safely cross the Channel.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Captain">
  <li>Walter — </li>

<ol data-speaker="SUFFOLK">
  <li>Gelidus timor occupat artus it is thee I fear.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WHITMORE">
  <li>Thou shalt have cause to fear before I leave thee.</li>
  <li>What, are ye daunted now? now will ye stoop?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Gentleman">
  <li>My gracious lord, entreat him, speak him fair.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUFFOLK">
  <li class="number">Suffolk’s imperial tongue is stern and rough,</li>
  <li>Used to command, untaught to plead for favour.</li>
  <li>Far be it we should honour such as these</li>
  <li>With humble suit: no, rather let my head</li>
  <li>Stoop to the block than these knees bow to any</li>
  <li class="number">Save to the God of heaven and to my king;</li>
  <li>And sooner dance upon a bloody pole</li>
  <li>Than stand uncover’d to the vulgar groom.</li>
  <li>True nobility is exempt from fear:</li>
  <li>More can I bear than you dare execute.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Captain">
  <li class="number">Hale him away, and let him talk no more.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUFFOLK">
  <li>Come, soldiers, show what cruelty ye can,</li>
  <li>That this my death may never be forgot!</li>
  <li>Great men oft die by vile bezonians:</li>
  <li>A Roman sworder and banditto slave</li>
  <li class="number">Murder’d sweet Tully; Brutus’ bastard hand</li>
  <li>Stabb’d Julius Caesar; savage islanders</li>
  <li>Pompey the Great; and Suffolk dies by pirates.</li>

<ol data-speaker="BEVIS">
  <li>I tell thee, Jack Cade the clothier means to dress</li>

  <li>So he had need, for ’tis threadbare. Well, I say it</li>

<ol data-speaker="BEVIS">
  <li>O miserable age! virtue is not regarded in handicrafts-men.</li>

<ol data-speaker="HOLLAND">
  <li>True; and yet it is said, labour in thy vocation;</li>

  <li>O, where is faith? O, where is loyalty?</li>
  <li>If it be banish’d from the frosty head,</li>

  <li>Wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war,</li>

  <li>Why art thou old, and want’st experience?</li>
  <li>Or wherefore dost abuse it, if thou hast it?</li>

<ol data-speaker="SALISBURY">
  <li>My lord, I have consider’d with myself</li>

<ol data-speaker="SALISBURY">
  <li>It is great sin to swear unto a sin,</li>

  <li>Who can be bound by any solemn vow</li>
  <li>To do a murderous deed, to rob a man,</li>
  <li>To force a spotless virgin’s chastity,</li>
  <li>To reave the orphan of his patrimony,</li>
  <li class="number">To wring the widow from her custom’d right,</li>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>Now, by my father’s badge, old Nevil’s crest,</li>
  <li class="number">The rampant bear chain’d to the ragged staff,</li>
  <li>This day I’ll wear aloft my burgonet,</li>
  <li>As on a mountain top the cedar shows</li>
  <li>That keeps his leaves in spite of any storm,</li>
  <li>Even to affright thee with the view thereof.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLIFFORD">
  <li class="number">And from thy burgonet I’ll rend thy bear</li>
  <li>And tread it under foot with all contempt,</li>
  <li>Despite the bear-ward that protects the bear.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YOUNG CLIFFORD">
  <li>And so to arms, victorious father,</li>
  <li>To quell the rebels and their complices.</li>
