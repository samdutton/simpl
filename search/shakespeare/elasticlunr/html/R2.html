<h3>SCENE I.  London. KING RICHARD II’s palace.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter KING RICHARD II, JOHN OF GAUNT, with other
Nobles and Attendants</div>

<ol data-speaker="KING RICHARD II">
  <li>Old John of Gaunt, time-honour’d Lancaster,</li>
  <li>Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,</li>
  <li>Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son,</li>
  <li>Here to make good the boisterous late appeal,</li>
  <li class="number">Which then our leisure would not let us hear,</li>
  <li>Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JOHN OF GAUNT">
  <li>I have, my liege.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING RICHARD II">
  <li>Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,</li>
  <li>If he appeal the duke on ancient malice;</li>
  <li class="number">Or worthily, as a good subject should,</li>
  <li>On some known ground of treachery in him?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JOHN OF GAUNT">
  <li>As near as I could sift him on that argument,</li>
  <li>On some apparent danger seen in him</li>
  <li>Aim’d at your highness, no inveterate malice.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING RICHARD II">
  <li class="number">Then call them to our presence; face to face,</li>
  <li>And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear</li>
  <li>The accuser and the accused freely speak:</li>
  <li>High-stomach’d are they both, and full of ire,</li>
  <li>In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE and THOMAS MOWBRAY</div>

<ol data-speaker="HENRY BOLINGBROKE">
  <li class="number">Many years of happy days befal</li>
  <li>My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THOMAS MOWBRAY">
  <li>Each day still better other’s happiness;</li>
  <li>Until the heavens, envying earth’s good hap,</li>
  <li>Add an immortal title to your crown!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING RICHARD II">
  <li class="number">We thank you both: yet one but flatters us,</li>
  <li>As well appeareth by the cause you come;</li>
  <li>Namely to appeal each other of high treason.</li>
  <li>Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object</li>
  <li>Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HENRY BOLINGBROKE">
  <li class="number">First, heaven be the record to my speech!</li>
  <li>In the devotion of a subject’s love,</li>
  <li>Tendering the precious safety of my prince,</li>
  <li>And free from other misbegotten hate,</li>
  <li>Come I appellant to this princely presence.</li>
  <li class="number">Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,</li>
  <li>And mark my greeting well; for what I speak</li>
  <li>My body shall make good upon this earth,</li>
  <li>Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.</li>
  <li>Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,</li>
  <li class="number">Too good to be so and too bad to live,</li>
  <li>Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,</li>
  <li>The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.</li>
  <li>Once more, the more to aggravate the note,</li>
  <li>With a foul traitor’s name stuff I thy throat;</li>
  <li class="number">And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,</li>
  <li>What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THOMAS MOWBRAY">
  <li>Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:</li>
  <li>’Tis not the trial of a woman’s war,</li>
  <li>The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,</li>
  <li class="number">Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;</li>
  <li>The blood is hot that must be cool’d for this:</li>
  <li>Yet can I not of such tame patience boast</li>
  <li>As to be hush’d and nought at all to say:</li>
  <li>First, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me</li>
  <li class="number">From giving reins and spurs to my free speech;</li>
  <li>Which else would post until it had return’d</li>
  <li>These terms of treason doubled down his throat.</li>
  <li>Setting aside his high blood’s royalty,</li>
  <li>And let him be no kinsman to my liege,</li>
  <li class="number">I do defy him, and I spit at him;</li>
  <li>Call him a slanderous coward and a villain:</li>
  <li>Which to maintain I would allow him odds,</li>
  <li>And meet him, were I tied to run afoot</li>
  <li>Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,</li>
  <li class="number">Or any other ground inhabitable,</li>
  <li>Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.</li>
  <li>Mean time let this defend my loyalty,</li>
  <li>By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HENRY BOLINGBROKE">
  <li>Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,</li>
  <li class="number">Disclaiming here the kindred of the king,</li>
  <li>And lay aside my high blood’s royalty,</li>
  <li>Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.</li>
  <li>If guilty dread have left thee so much strength</li>
  <li>As to take up mine honour’s pawn, then stoop:</li>
  <li class="number">By that and all the rites of knighthood else,</li>
  <li>Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,</li>
  <li>What I have spoke, or thou canst worse devise.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THOMAS MOWBRAY">
  <li>I take it up; and by that sword I swear</li>
  <li>Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,</li>
  <li class="number">I’ll answer thee in any fair degree,</li>
  <li>Or chivalrous design of knightly trial:</li>
  <li>And when I mount, alive may I not light,</li>
  <li>If I be traitor or unjustly fight!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING RICHARD II">
  <li>What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray’s charge?</li>
  <li class="number">It must be great that can inherit us</li>
  <li>So much as of a thought of ill in him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HENRY BOLINGBROKE">
  <li>Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it true;</li>
  <li>That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles</li>
  <li>In name of lendings for your highness’ soldiers,</li>
  <li class="number">The which he hath detain’d for lewd employments,</li>
  <li>Like a false traitor and injurious villain.</li>
  <li>Besides I say and will in battle prove,</li>
  <li>Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge</li>
  <li>That ever was survey’d by English eye,</li>
  <li class="number">That all the treasons for these eighteen years</li>
  <li>Complotted and contrived in this land</li>
  <li>Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.</li>
  <li>Further I say and further will maintain</li>
  <li>Upon his bad life to make all this good,</li>
  <li class="number">That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester’s death,</li>
  <li>Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,</li>
  <li>And consequently, like a traitor coward,</li>
  <li>Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood:</li>
  <li>Which blood, like sacrificing Abel’s, cries,</li>
  <li class="number">Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,</li>
  <li>To me for justice and rough chastisement;</li>
  <li>And, by the glorious worth of my descent,</li>
  <li>This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING RICHARD II">
  <li>How high a pitch his resolution soars!</li>
  <li class="number">Thomas of Norfolk, what say’st thou to this?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THOMAS MOWBRAY">
  <li>O, let my sovereign turn away his face</li>
  <li>And bid his ears a little while be deaf,</li>
  <li>Till I have told this slander of his blood,</li>
  <li>How God and good men hate so foul a liar.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING RICHARD II">
  <li class="number">Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears:</li>
  <li>Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom’s heir,</li>
  <li>As he is but my father’s brother’s son,</li>
  <li>Now, by my sceptre’s awe, I make a vow,</li>
  <li>Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood</li>
  <li class="number">Should nothing privilege him, nor partialize</li>
  <li>The unstooping firmness of my upright soul:</li>
  <li>He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou:</li>
  <li>Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THOMAS MOWBRAY">
  <li>Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,</li>
  <li class="number">Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.</li>
  <li>Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais</li>
  <li>Disbursed I duly to his highness’ soldiers;</li>
  <li>The other part reserved I by consent,</li>
  <li>For that my sovereign liege was in my debt</li>
  <li class="number">Upon remainder of a dear account,</li>
  <li>Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:</li>
  <li>Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester’s death,</li>
  <li>I slew him not; but to my own disgrace</li>
  <li>Neglected my sworn duty in that case.</li>
  <li class="number">For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,</li>
  <li>The honourable father to my foe</li>
  <li>Once did I lay an ambush for your life,</li>
  <li>A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul</li>
  <li>But ere I last received the sacrament</li>
  <li class="number">I did confess it, and exactly begg’d</li>
  <li>Your grace’s pardon, and I hope I had it.</li>
  <li>This is my fault: as for the rest appeall’d,</li>
  <li>It issues from the rancour of a villain,</li>
  <li>A recreant and most degenerate traitor</li>
  <li class="number">Which in myself I boldly will defend;</li>
  <li>And interchangeably hurl down my gage</li>
  <li>Upon this overweening traitor’s foot,</li>
  <li>To prove myself a loyal gentleman</li>
  <li>Even in the best blood chamber’d in his bosom.</li>
  <li class="number">In haste whereof, most heartily I pray</li>
  <li>Your highness to assign our trial day.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING RICHARD II">
  <li>Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be ruled by me;</li>
  <li>Let’s purge this choler without letting blood:</li>
  <li>This we prescribe, though no physician;</li>
  <li class="number">Deep malice makes too deep incision;</li>
  <li>Forget, forgive; conclude and be agreed;</li>
  <li>Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.</li>
  <li>Good uncle, let this end where it begun;</li>
  <li>We’ll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JOHN OF GAUNT">
  <li class="number">To be a make-peace shall become my age:</li>
  <li>Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk’s gage.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING RICHARD II">
  <li>And, Norfolk, throw down his.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JOHN OF GAUNT">
  <li>When, Harry, when?</li>
  <li>Obedience bids I should not bid again.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING RICHARD II">
  <li class="number">Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THOMAS MOWBRAY">
  <li>Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot.</li>
  <li>My life thou shalt command, but not my shame:</li>
  <li>The one my duty owes; but my fair name,</li>
  <li>Despite of death that lives upon my grave,</li>
  <li class="number">To dark dishonour’s use thou shalt not have.</li>
  <li>I am disgraced, impeach’d and baffled here,</li>
  <li>Pierced to the soul with slander’s venom’d spear,</li>
  <li>The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood</li>
  <li>Which breathed this poison.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING RICHARD II">
  <li class="number">Rage must be withstood:</li>
  <li>Give me his gage: lions make leopards tame.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THOMAS MOWBRAY">
  <li>Yea, but not change his spots: take but my shame.</li>
  <li>And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,</li>
  <li>The purest treasure mortal times afford</li>
  <li class="number">Is spotless reputation: that away,</li>
  <li>Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.</li>
  <li>A jewel in a ten-times-barr’d-up chest</li>
  <li>Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.</li>
  <li>Mine honour is my life; both grow in one:</li>
  <li class="number">Take honour from me, and my life is done:</li>
  <li>Then, dear my liege, mine honour let me try;</li>
  <li>In that I live and for that will I die.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING RICHARD II">
  <li>Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HENRY BOLINGBROKE">
  <li>O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!</li>
  <li class="number">Shall I seem crest-fall’n in my father’s sight?</li>
  <li>Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height</li>
  <li>Before this out-dared dastard? Ere my tongue</li>
  <li>Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong,</li>
  <li>Or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear</li>
  <li class="number">The slavish motive of recanting fear,</li>
  <li>And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,</li>
  <li>Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray’s face.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit JOHN OF GAUNT</div>

<ol data-speaker="KING RICHARD II">
  <li>We were not born to sue, but to command;</li>
  <li>Which since we cannot do to make you friends,</li>
  <li class="number">Be ready, as your lives shall answer it,</li>
  <li>At Coventry, upon Saint Lambert’s day:</li>
  <li>There shall your swords and lances arbitrate</li>
  <li>The swelling difference of your settled hate:</li>
  <li>Since we can not atone you, we shall see</li>
  <li class="number">Justice design the victor’s chivalry.</li>
  <li>Lord marshal, command our officers at arms</li>
  <li>Be ready to direct these home alarms.</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  The DUKE OF LANCASTER’S palace.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter JOHN OF GAUNT with DUCHESS</div>

<ol data-speaker="JOHN OF GAUNT">
  <li>Alas, the part I had in Woodstock’s blood</li>
  <li>Doth more solicit me than your exclaims,</li>
  <li>To stir against the butchers of his life!</li>
  <li>But since correction lieth in those hands</li>
  <li class="number">Which made the fault that we cannot correct,</li>
  <li>Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven;</li>
  <li>Who, when they see the hours ripe on earth,</li>
  <li>Will rain hot vengeance on offenders’ heads.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUCHESS">
  <li>Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?</li>
  <li class="number">Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?</li>
  <li>Edward’s seven sons, whereof thyself art one,</li>
  <li>Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,</li>
  <li>Or seven fair branches springing from one root:</li>
  <li>Some of those seven are dried by nature’s course,</li>
  <li class="number">Some of those branches by the Destinies cut;</li>
  <li>But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,</li>
  <li>One vial full of Edward’s sacred blood,</li>
  <li>One flourishing branch of his most royal root,</li>
  <li>Is crack’d, and all the precious liquor spilt,</li>
  <li class="number">Is hack’d down, and his summer leaves all faded,</li>
  <li>By envy’s hand and murder’s bloody axe.</li>
  <li>Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! that bed, that womb,</li>
  <li>That metal, that self-mould, that fashion’d thee</li>
  <li>Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest,</li>
  <li class="number">Yet art thou slain in him: thou dost consent</li>
  <li>In some large measure to thy father’s death,</li>
  <li>In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,</li>
  <li>Who was the model of thy father’s life.</li>
  <li>Call it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair:</li>
  <li class="number">In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter’d,</li>
  <li>Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,</li>
  <li>Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee:</li>
  <li>That which in mean men we intitle patience</li>
  <li>Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.</li>
  <li class="number">What shall I say? to safeguard thine own life,</li>
  <li>The best way is to venge my Gloucester’s death.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JOHN OF GAUNT">
  <li>God’s is the quarrel; for God’s substitute,</li>
  <li>His deputy anointed in His sight,</li>
  <li>Hath caused his death: the which if wrongfully,</li>
  <li class="number">Let heaven revenge; for I may never lift</li>
  <li>An angry arm against His minister.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUCHESS">
  <li>Where then, alas, may I complain myself?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JOHN OF GAUNT">
  <li>To God, the widow’s champion and defence.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUCHESS">
  <li>Why, then, I will. Farewell, old Gaunt.</li>
  <li class="number">Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold</li>
  <li>Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight:</li>
  <li>O, sit my husband’s wrongs on Hereford’s spear,</li>
  <li>That it may enter butcher Mowbray’s breast!</li>
  <li>Or, if misfortune miss the first career,</li>
  <li class="number">Be Mowbray’s sins so heavy in his bosom,</li>
  <li>They may break his foaming courser’s back,</li>
  <li>And throw the rider headlong in the lists,</li>
  <li>A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!</li>
  <li>Farewell, old Gaunt: thy sometimes brother’s wife</li>
  <li class="number">With her companion grief must end her life.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JOHN OF GAUNT">
  <li>Sister, farewell; I must to Coventry:</li>
  <li>As much good stay with thee as go with me!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUCHESS">
  <li>Yet one word more: grief boundeth where it falls,</li>
  <li>Not with the empty hollowness, but weight:</li>
  <li class="number">I take my leave before I have begun,</li>
  <li>For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.</li>
  <li>Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York.</li>
  <li>Lo, this is all: — nay, yet depart not so;</li>
  <li>Though this be all, do not so quickly go;</li>
  <li class="number">I shall remember more. Bid him — ah, what? — </li>
  <li>With all good speed at Plashy visit me.</li>
  <li>Alack, and what shall good old York there see</li>
  <li>But empty lodgings and unfurnish’d walls,</li>
  <li>Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?</li>
  <li class="number">And what hear there for welcome but my groans?</li>
  <li>Therefore commend me; let him not come there,</li>
  <li>To seek out sorrow that dwells every where.</li>
  <li>Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die:</li>
  <li>The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.</li>

  <li>Madam, your majesty is too much sad:</li>
  <li>You promised, when you parted with the king,</li>

  <li>And entertain a cheerful disposition.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN">
  <li class="number">To please the king I did; to please myself</li>
  <li>I cannot do it; yet I know no cause</li>
  <li>Why I should welcome such a guest as grief,</li>

  <li>As my sweet Richard: yet again, methinks,</li>
  <li class="number">Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune’s womb,</li>

<ol data-speaker="BUSHY">
  <li>Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,</li>
  <li class="number">Which shows like grief itself, but is not so;</li>
  <li>For sorrow’s eye, glazed with blinding tears,</li>
  <li>Divides one thing entire to many objects;</li>
  <li>Like perspectives, which rightly gazed upon</li>
  <li>Show nothing but confusion, eyed awry</li>
  <li class="number">Distinguish form: so your sweet majesty,</li>

  <li>Which, look’d on as it is, is nought but shadows</li>
  <li>Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen,</li>
  <li class="number">More than your lord’s departure weep not: more’s not seen;</li>

  <li class="number">I cannot but be sad; so heavy sad</li>
  <li>As, though on thinking on no thought I think,</li>
  <li>Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUSHY">
  <li>’Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.</li>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN">
  <li>’Tis nothing less: conceit is still derived</li>

<ol data-speaker="NORTHUMBERLAND">
  <li>Believe me, noble lord,</li>
  <li>I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire:</li>
  <li>These high wild hills and rough uneven ways</li>
  <li class="number">Draws out our miles, and makes them wearisome,</li>
  <li>And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,</li>
  <li>Making the hard way sweet and delectable.</li>
  <li>But I bethink me what a weary way</li>
  <li>From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found</li>
  <li class="number">In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,</li>
  <li>Which, I protest, hath very much beguiled</li>
  <li>The tediousness and process of my travel:</li>
  <li>But theirs is sweetened with the hope to have</li>
  <li>The present benefit which I possess;</li>
  <li class="number">And hope to joy is little less in joy</li>
  <li>Than hope enjoy’d: by this the weary lords</li>

  <li>By sight of what I have, your noble company.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HENRY BOLINGBROKE">

  <li>Harry, how fares your uncle?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HENRY PERCY">
  <li>I had thought, my lord, to have learn’d his health of you.</li>

<ol data-speaker="NORTHUMBERLAND">
  <li class="number">Why, is he not with the queen?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HENRY PERCY">
  <li>No, my good Lord; he hath forsook the court,</li>
  <li>Broken his staff of office and dispersed</li>
  <li>The household of the king.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTHUMBERLAND">
  <li>What was his reason?</li>
  <li class="number">He was not so resolved when last we spake together.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HENRY PERCY">
  <li>Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor.</li>
  <li>But he, my lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTHUMBERLAND">

  <li>No, my good lord, for that is not forgot</li>
  <li>Which ne’er I did remember: to my knowledge,</li>
  <li class="number">I never in my life did look on him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTHUMBERLAND">
  <li>Then learn to know him now; this is the duke.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HENRY PERCY">
  <li>My gracious lord, I tender you my service,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HENRY BOLINGBROKE">
  <li>I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure</li>

  <li>Comest thou because the anointed king is hence?</li>
  <li>Why, foolish boy, the king is left behind,</li>

  <li class="number">Were I but now the lord of such hot youth</li>
  <li>As when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself</li>

  <li>O, then how quickly should this arm of mine.</li>

<ol data-speaker="HENRY BOLINGBROKE">
  <li>My gracious uncle, let me know my fault:</li>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE OF YORK">
  <li>Even in condition of the worst degree,</li>
  <li class="number">In gross rebellion and detested treason:</li>

  <li>Before the expiration of thy time,</li>
  <li>In braving arms against thy sovereign.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HENRY BOLINGBROKE">
  <li>As I was banish’d, I was banish’d Hereford;</li>
  <li class="number">But as I come, I come for Lancaster.</li>
  <li>And, noble uncle, I beseech your grace</li>
  <li>Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye:</li>
  <li>You are my father, for methinks in you</li>
  <li>I see old Gaunt alive; O, then, my father,</li>
  <li class="number">Will you permit that I shall stand condemn’d</li>
  <li>A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties</li>
  <li>Pluck’d from my arms perforce and given away</li>
  <li>To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born?</li>
  <li>If that my cousin king be King of England,</li>
  <li class="number">It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.</li>
  <li>You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin;</li>
  <li>Had you first died, and he been thus trod down,</li>
  <li>He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father,</li>
  <li>To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay.</li>
  <li class="number">I am denied to sue my livery here,</li>
  <li>And yet my letters-patents give me leave:</li>
  <li>My father’s goods are all distrain’d and sold,</li>

  <li>What would you have me do? I am a subject,</li>
  <li class="number">And I challenge law: attorneys are denied me;</li>
  <li>And therefore, personally I lay my claim</li>
  <li>To my inheritance of free descent.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTHUMBERLAND">
  <li>The noble duke hath been too much abused.</li>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE OF YORK">
  <li>My lords of England, let me tell you this:</li>
  <li>I have had feeling of my cousin’s wrongs</li>
  <li>And laboured all I could to do him right;</li>
  <li>But in this kind to come, in braving arms,</li>
  <li class="number">Be his own carver and cut out his way,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE OF YORK">
  <li>Well, well, I see the issue of these arms:</li>
  <li>I cannot mend it, I must needs confess,</li>
  <li class="number">Because my power is weak and all ill left:</li>
  <li>But if I could, by Him that gave me life,</li>
  <li>I would attach you all and make you stoop</li>
  <li>Unto the sovereign mercy of the king;</li>
  <li>But since I cannot, be it known to you</li>
  <li class="number">I do remain as neuter. So, fare you well;</li>

  <li>Tell Bolingbroke — for yond methinks he stands — </li>
  <li>That every stride he makes upon my land</li>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN">
  <li>What sport shall we devise here in this garden,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Lady">
  <li>Madam, we’ll play at bowls.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN">
  <li>’Twill make me think the world is full of rubs,</li>

  <li>Madam, we’ll dance.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN">
  <li>My legs can keep no measure in delight,</li>
  <li>When my poor heart no measure keeps in grief:</li>
  <li>Therefore, no dancing, girl; some other sport.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Lady">
  <li class="number">Madam, we’ll tell tales.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN">
  <li>Of sorrow or of joy?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Lady">
  <li>Of either, madam.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN">
  <li>Of neither, girl:</li>
  <li>For of joy, being altogether wanting,</li>
  <li class="number">It doth remember me the more of sorrow;</li>
  <li>Or if of grief, being altogether had,</li>
  <li>It adds more sorrow to my want of joy:</li>
  <li>For what I have I need not to repeat;</li>
  <li>And what I want it boots not to complain.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Lady">
  <li class="number">Madam, I’ll sing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN">
  <li>’Tis well that thou hast cause</li>
  <li>But thou shouldst please me better, wouldst thou weep.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Lady">
  <li>I could weep, madam, would it do you good.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN">
  <li>And I could sing, would weeping do me good,</li>
  <li class="number">And never borrow any tear of thee.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter a Gardener, and two Servants</li>
  <li>But stay, here come the gardeners:</li>
  <li>Let’s step into the shadow of these trees.</li>
  <li>My wretchedness unto a row of pins,</li>
  <li>They’ll talk of state; for every one doth so</li>
  <li class="number">Against a change; woe is forerun with woe.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">QUEEN and Ladies retire</div>

<ol data-speaker="Gardener">
  <li>Go, bind thou up yon dangling apricocks,</li>
  <li>Which, like unruly children, make their sire</li>
  <li>Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight:</li>
  <li>Give some supportance to the bending twigs.</li>
  <li class="number">Go thou, and like an executioner,</li>
  <li>Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays,</li>
  <li>That look too lofty in our commonwealth:</li>
  <li>All must be even in our government.</li>
  <li>You thus employ’d, I will go root away</li>
  <li class="number">The noisome weeds, which without profit suck</li>
  <li>The soil’s fertility from wholesome flowers.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Servant">
  <li>Why should we in the compass of a pale</li>
  <li>Keep law and form and due proportion,</li>
  <li>Showing, as in a model, our firm estate,</li>
  <li class="number">When our sea-walled garden, the whole land,</li>
  <li>Is full of weeds, her fairest flowers choked up,</li>
  <li>Her fruit-trees all upturned, her hedges ruin’d,</li>
  <li>Her knots disorder’d and her wholesome herbs</li>
  <li>Swarming with caterpillars?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Gardener">
  <li class="number">Hold thy peace:</li>
  <li>He that hath suffer’d this disorder’d spring</li>
  <li>Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf:</li>
  <li>The weeds which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter,</li>
  <li>That seem’d in eating him to hold him up,</li>
  <li class="number">Are pluck’d up root and all by Bolingbroke,</li>
  <li>I mean the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Servant">
  <li>What, are they dead?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Gardener">
  <li>They are; and Bolingbroke</li>
  <li>Hath seized the wasteful king. O, what pity is it</li>
  <li class="number">That he had not so trimm’d and dress’d his land</li>
  <li>As we this garden! We at time of year</li>
  <li>Do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit-trees,</li>
  <li>Lest, being over-proud in sap and blood,</li>
  <li>With too much riches it confound itself:</li>
  <li class="number">Had he done so to great and growing men,</li>
  <li>They might have lived to bear and he to taste</li>
  <li>Their fruits of duty: superfluous branches</li>
  <li>We lop away, that bearing boughs may live:</li>
  <li>Had he done so, himself had borne the crown,</li>
  <li class="number">Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Servant">
  <li>What, think you then the king shall be deposed?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Gardener">
  <li>Depress’d he is already, and deposed</li>
  <li>’Tis doubt he will be: letters came last night</li>
  <li>To a dear friend of the good Duke of York’s,</li>
  <li class="number">That tell black tidings.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN">
  <li>O, I am press’d to death through want of speaking!</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Coming forward</li>
  <li>Thou, old Adam’s likeness, set to dress this garden,</li>
  <li>How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news?</li>
  <li>What Eve, what serpent, hath suggested thee</li>
  <li class="number">To make a second fall of cursed man?</li>
  <li>Why dost thou say King Richard is deposed?</li>
  <li>Darest thou, thou little better thing than earth,</li>
  <li>Divine his downfall? Say, where, when, and how,</li>
  <li>Camest thou by this ill tidings? speak, thou wretch.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Gardener">
  <li class="number">Pardon me, madam: little joy have I</li>
  <li>To breathe this news; yet what I say is true.</li>
  <li>King Richard, he is in the mighty hold</li>
  <li>Of Bolingbroke: their fortunes both are weigh’d:</li>
  <li>In your lord’s scale is nothing but himself,</li>
  <li class="number">And some few vanities that make him light;</li>
  <li>But in the balance of great Bolingbroke,</li>
  <li>Besides himself, are all the English peers,</li>
  <li>And with that odds he weighs King Richard down.</li>
  <li>Post you to London, and you will find it so;</li>
  <li class="number">I speak no more than every one doth know.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN">
  <li>Nimble mischance, that art so light of foot,</li>
  <li>Doth not thy embassage belong to me,</li>
  <li>And am I last that knows it? O, thou think’st</li>
  <li>To serve me last, that I may longest keep</li>
  <li class="number">Thy sorrow in my breast. Come, ladies, go,</li>
  <li>To meet at London London’s king in woe.</li>
  <li>What, was I born to this, that my sad look</li>
  <li>Should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke?</li>
  <li>Gardener, for telling me these news of woe,</li>
  <li class="number">Pray God the plants thou graft’st may never grow.</li>

<h3>SCENE I.  Westminster Hall.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter, as to the Parliament, HENRY BOLINGBROKE,
DUKE OF AUMERLE, NORTHUMBERLAND, HENRY PERCY, LORD
FITZWATER, DUKE OF SURREY, the BISHOP OF CARLISLE,
the Abbot Of Westminster, and another Lord, Herald,
Officers, and BAGOT</div>

<ol data-speaker="HENRY BOLINGBROKE">
  <li>Call forth Bagot.</li>
  <li>Now, Bagot, freely speak thy mind;</li>
  <li>What thou dost know of noble Gloucester’s death,</li>
  <li>Who wrought it with the king, and who perform’d</li>
  <li class="number">The bloody office of his timeless end.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAGOT">
  <li>Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HENRY BOLINGBROKE">
  <li>Cousin, stand forth, and look upon that man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAGOT">
  <li>My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue</li>
  <li>Scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver’d.</li>
  <li class="number">In that dead time when Gloucester’s death was plotted,</li>
  <li>I heard you say, ’Is not my arm of length,</li>
  <li>That reacheth from the restful English court</li>
  <li>As far as Calais, to mine uncle’s head?’</li>
  <li>Amongst much other talk, that very time,</li>
  <li class="number">I heard you say that you had rather refuse</li>
  <li>The offer of an hundred thousand crowns</li>
  <li>Than Bolingbroke’s return to England;</li>
  <li>Adding withal how blest this land would be</li>
  <li>In this your cousin’s death.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE OF AUMERLE">
  <li class="number">Princes and noble lords,</li>
  <li>What answer shall I make to this base man?</li>
  <li>Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars,</li>
  <li>On equal terms to give him chastisement?</li>
  <li>Either I must, or have mine honour soil’d</li>
  <li class="number">With the attainder of his slanderous lips.</li>
  <li>There is my gage, the manual seal of death,</li>
  <li>That marks thee out for hell: I say, thou liest,</li>
  <li>And will maintain what thou hast said is false</li>
  <li>In thy heart-blood, though being all too base</li>
  <li class="number">To stain the temper of my knightly sword.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HENRY BOLINGBROKE">
  <li>Bagot, forbear; thou shalt not take it up.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE OF AUMERLE">
  <li>Excepting one, I would he were the best</li>
  <li>In all this presence that hath moved me so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD FITZWATER">
  <li>If that thy valour stand on sympathy,</li>
  <li class="number">There is my gage, Aumerle, in gage to thine:</li>
  <li>By that fair sun which shows me where thou stand’st,</li>
  <li>I heard thee say, and vauntingly thou spakest it</li>
  <li>That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester’s death.</li>
  <li>If thou deny’st it twenty times, thou liest;</li>
  <li class="number">And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart,</li>
  <li>Where it was forged, with my rapier’s point.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE OF AUMERLE">
  <li>Thou darest not, coward, live to see that day.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD FITZWATER">
  <li>Now by my soul, I would it were this hour.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE OF AUMERLE">
  <li>Fitzwater, thou art damn’d to hell for this.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HENRY PERCY">
  <li class="number">Aumerle, thou liest; his honour is as true</li>
  <li>In this appeal as thou art all unjust;</li>
  <li>And that thou art so, there I throw my gage,</li>
  <li>To prove it on thee to the extremest point</li>
  <li>Of mortal breathing: seize it, if thou darest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE OF AUMERLE">
  <li class="number">An if I do not, may my hands rot off</li>
  <li>And never brandish more revengeful steel</li>
  <li>Over the glittering helmet of my foe!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Lord">
  <li>I task the earth to the like, forsworn Aumerle;</li>
  <li>And spur thee on with full as many lies</li>
  <li class="number">As may be holloa’d in thy treacherous ear</li>
  <li>From sun to sun: there is my honour’s pawn;</li>
  <li>Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE OF AUMERLE">
  <li>Who sets me else? by heaven, I’ll throw at all:</li>
  <li>I have a thousand spirits in one breast,</li>
  <li class="number">To answer twenty thousand such as you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE OF SURREY">
  <li>My Lord Fitzwater, I do remember well</li>
  <li>The very time Aumerle and you did talk.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD FITZWATER">
  <li>’Tis very true: you were in presence then;</li>
  <li>And you can witness with me this is true.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE OF SURREY">
  <li class="number">As false, by heaven, as heaven itself is true.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD FITZWATER">
  <li>Surrey, thou liest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE OF SURREY">
  <li>Dishonourable boy!</li>
  <li>That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword,</li>
  <li>That it shall render vengeance and revenge</li>
  <li class="number">Till thou the lie-giver and that lie do lie</li>
  <li>In earth as quiet as thy father’s skull:</li>
  <li>In proof whereof, there is my honour’s pawn;</li>
  <li>Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD FITZWATER">
  <li>How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse!</li>
  <li class="number">If I dare eat, or drink, or breathe, or live,</li>
  <li>I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness,</li>
  <li>And spit upon him, whilst I say he lies,</li>
  <li>And lies, and lies: there is my bond of faith,</li>
  <li>To tie thee to my strong correction.</li>
  <li class="number">As I intend to thrive in this new world,</li>
  <li>Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal:</li>
  <li>Besides, I heard the banish’d Norfolk say</li>
  <li>That thou, Aumerle, didst send two of thy men</li>
  <li>To execute the noble duke at Calais.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE OF AUMERLE">
  <li class="number">Some honest Christian trust me with a gage</li>
  <li>That Norfolk lies: here do I throw down this,</li>
  <li>If he may be repeal’d, to try his honour.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HENRY BOLINGBROKE">
  <li>These differences shall all rest under gage</li>
  <li>Till Norfolk be repeal’d: repeal’d he shall be,</li>
  <li class="number">And, though mine enemy, restored again</li>
  <li>To all his lands and signories: when he’s return’d,</li>
  <li>Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BISHOP OF CARLISLE">
  <li>That honourable day shall ne’er be seen.</li>
  <li>Many a time hath banish’d Norfolk fought</li>
  <li class="number">For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field,</li>
  <li>Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross</li>
  <li>Against black pagans, Turks, and Saracens:</li>
  <li>And toil’d with works of war, retired himself</li>
  <li>To Italy; and there at Venice gave</li>
  <li class="number">His body to that pleasant country’s earth,</li>
  <li>And his pure soul unto his captain Christ,</li>
  <li>Under whose colours he had fought so long.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HENRY BOLINGBROKE">
  <li>Why, bishop, is Norfolk dead?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BISHOP OF CARLISLE">
  <li>As surely as I live, my lord.</li>

  <li>My crown I am; but still my griefs are mine:</li>

  <li>Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down.</li>

  <li class="number">Mark’d with a blot, damn’d in the book of heaven:</li>
  <li>Nay, all of you that stand and look upon,</li>
  <li>Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself,</li>
  <li>Though some of you with Pilate wash your hands</li>
  <li>Showing an outward pity; yet you Pilates</li>

</ol>

  <li>My lord, dispatch; read o’er these articles.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING RICHARD II">
  <li>Mine eyes are full of tears, I cannot see:</li>
  <li>And yet salt water blinds them not so much</li>
  <li class="number">But they can see a sort of traitors here.</li>
  <li>Nay, if I turn mine eyes upon myself,</li>
  <li>I find myself a traitor with the rest;</li>
  <li>For I have given here my soul’s consent</li>
  <li>To undeck the pompous body of a king;</li>
  <li class="number">Made glory base and sovereignty a slave,</li>
  <li>Proud majesty a subject, state a peasant.</li>

  <li>My lord — </li>

<ol data-speaker="KING RICHARD II">
  <li>No lord of thine, thou haught insulting man,</li>
  <li>Nor no man’s lord; I have no name, no title,</li>

  <li>That I have worn so many winters out,</li>
  <li>And know not now what name to call myself!</li>
  <li>O that I were a mockery king of snow,</li>
  <li class="number">Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke,</li>
  <li>To melt myself away in water-drops!</li>
  <li>Good king, great king, and yet not greatly good,</li>
  <li>An if my word be sterling yet in England,</li>
  <li>Let it command a mirror hither straight,</li>
  <li class="number">That it may show me what a face I have,</li>

  <li>No deeper wrinkles yet? hath sorrow struck</li>
  <li>So many blows upon this face of mine,</li>
  <li>And made no deeper wounds? O flattering glass,</li>
  <li>Like to my followers in prosperity,</li>
  <li class="number">Thou dost beguile me! Was this face the face</li>
  <li>That every day under his household roof</li>
  <li>Did keep ten thousand men? was this the face</li>
  <li>That, like the sun, did make beholders wink?</li>
  <li>Was this the face that faced so many follies,</li>
  <li class="number">And was at last out-faced by Bolingbroke?</li>
  <li>A brittle glory shineth in this face:</li>
  <li>As brittle as the glory is the face;</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Dashes the glass against the ground</li>
  <li>For there it is, crack’d in a hundred shivers.</li>
  <li>Mark, silent king, the moral of this sport,</li>
  <li class="number">How soon my sorrow hath destroy’d my face.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HENRY BOLINGBROKE">
  <li>The shadow of your sorrow hath destroy’d</li>
  <li>The shadow or your face.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING RICHARD II">
  <li>Say that again.</li>
  <li>The shadow of my sorrow! ha! let’s see:</li>
  <li class="number">’Tis very true, my grief lies all within;</li>
  <li>And these external manners of laments</li>
  <li>Are merely shadows to the unseen grief</li>
  <li>That swells with silence in the tortured soul;</li>
  <li>There lies the substance: and I thank thee, king,</li>
  <li class="number">For thy great bounty, that not only givest</li>
  <li>Me cause to wail but teachest me the way</li>
  <li>How to lament the cause. I’ll beg one boon,</li>
  <li>And then be gone and trouble you no more.</li>
  <li>Shall I obtain it?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HENRY BOLINGBROKE">
  <li class="number">Name it, fair cousin.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING RICHARD II">
  <li>’Fair cousin’? I am greater than a king:</li>
  <li>For when I was a king, my flatterers</li>
  <li>Were then but subjects; being now a subject,</li>
  <li>I have a king here to my flatterer.</li>
  <li class="number">Being so great, I have no need to beg.</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter QUEEN and Ladies</div>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN">
  <li>This way the king will come; this is the way</li>
  <li>To Julius Caesar’s ill-erected tower,</li>

  <li class="number">Here let us rest, if this rebellious earth</li>

  <li class="stage-direction">Enter KING RICHARD II and Guard</li>
  <li>But soft, but see, or rather do not see,</li>
  <li>My fair rose wither: yet look up, behold,</li>
  <li>That you in pity may dissolve to dew,</li>
  <li class="number">And wash him fresh again with true-love tears.</li>
  <li>Ah, thou, the model where old Troy did stand,</li>
  <li>Thou map of honour, thou King Richard’s tomb,</li>
  <li>And not King Richard; thou most beauteous inn,</li>
  <li>Why should hard-favour’d grief be lodged in thee,</li>
  <li class="number">When triumph is become an alehouse guest?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING RICHARD II">
  <li>Join not with grief, fair woman, do not so,</li>
  <li>To make my end too sudden: learn, good soul,</li>
  <li>To think our former state a happy dream;</li>
  <li>From which awaked, the truth of what we are</li>
  <li class="number">Shows us but this: I am sworn brother, sweet,</li>
  <li>To grim Necessity, and he and I</li>
  <li>Will keep a league till death. Hie thee to France</li>
  <li>And cloister thee in some religious house:</li>
  <li>Our holy lives must win a new world’s crown,</li>
  <li class="number">Which our profane hours here have stricken down.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN">
  <li>What, is my Richard both in shape and mind</li>
  <li>Transform’d and weaken’d? hath Bolingbroke deposed</li>
  <li>Thine intellect? hath he been in thy heart?</li>
  <li>The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw,</li>
  <li class="number">And wounds the earth, if nothing else, with rage</li>
  <li>To be o’erpower’d; and wilt thou, pupil-like,</li>
  <li>Take thy correction mildly, kiss the rod,</li>
  <li>And fawn on rage with base humility,</li>
  <li>Which art a lion and a king of beasts?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING RICHARD II">
  <li class="number">A king of beasts, indeed; if aught but beasts,</li>
  <li>I had been still a happy king of men.</li>
  <li>Good sometime queen, prepare thee hence for France:</li>

  <li>As from my death-bed, thy last living leave.</li>
  <li class="number">In winter’s tedious nights sit by the fire</li>

  <li class="number">And send the hearers weeping to their beds:</li>
  <li>For why, the senseless brands will sympathize</li>
  <li>The heavy accent of thy moving tongue</li>

  <li class="number">Northumberland, thou ladder wherewithal</li>
  <li>The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne,</li>
  <li>The time shall not be many hours of age</li>
  <li>More than it is ere foul sin gathering head</li>
  <li>Shalt break into corruption: thou shalt think,</li>
  <li class="number">Though he divide the realm and give thee half,</li>
  <li>It is too little, helping him to all;</li>
  <li>And he shall think that thou, which know’st the way</li>
  <li>To plant unrightful kings, wilt know again,</li>
  <li>Being ne’er so little urged, another way</li>
  <li class="number">To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne.</li>
  <li>The love of wicked men converts to fear;</li>
  <li>That fear to hate, and hate turns one or both</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTHUMBERLAND">
  <li>My guilt be on my head, and there an end.</li>
  <li class="number">Take leave and part; for you must part forthwith.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING RICHARD II">
  <li>Doubly divorced! Bad men, you violate</li>
  <li>A twofold marriage, ’twixt my crown and me,</li>
  <li>And then betwixt me and my married wife.</li>
  <li>Let me unkiss the oath ’twixt thee and me;</li>
  <li class="number">And yet not so, for with a kiss ’twas made.</li>
  <li>Part us, Northumberland; I toward the north,</li>
  <li>Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime;</li>
  <li>My wife to France: from whence, set forth in pomp,</li>
  <li>She came adorned hither like sweet May,</li>
  <li class="number">Sent back like Hallowmas or short’st of day.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN">
  <li>And must we be divided? must we part?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING RICHARD II">
  <li>Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN">
  <li>Banish us both and send the king with me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTHUMBERLAND">
  <li>That were some love but little policy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN">
  <li class="number">Then whither he goes, thither let me go.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING RICHARD II">
  <li>So two, together weeping, make one woe.</li>
  <li>Weep thou for me in France, I for thee here;</li>
  <li>Better far off than near, be ne’er the near.</li>
  <li>Go, count thy way with sighs; I mine with groans.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN">
  <li class="number">So longest way shall have the longest moans.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING RICHARD II">
  <li>Twice for one step I’ll groan, the way being short,</li>
  <li>And piece the way out with a heavy heart.</li>
  <li>Come, come, in wooing sorrow let’s be brief,</li>
  <li>Since, wedding it, there is such length in grief;</li>
  <li class="number">One kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part;</li>
  <li>Thus give I mine, and thus take I thy heart.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN">
  <li>Give me mine own again; ’twere no good part</li>
  <li>To take on me to keep and kill thy heart.</li>
  <li>So, now I have mine own again, be gone,</li>
  <li class="number">That I might strive to kill it with a groan.</li>

  <li>Where did I leave?</li>

<ol data-speaker="DUCHESS OF YORK">
  <li class="number">At that sad stop, my lord,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE OF YORK">
  <li>Then, as I said, the duke, great Bolingbroke,</li>

  <li class="number">As in a theatre, the eyes of men,</li>

  <li>No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home:</li>

  <li class="number">The badges of his grief and patience,</li>
  <li>That had not God, for some strong purpose, steel’d</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING RICHARD II">
  <li>I have been studying how I may compare</li>
  <li>This prison where I live unto the world:</li>
  <li>And for because the world is populous</li>
  <li>And here is not a creature but myself,</li>
  <li class="number">I cannot do it; yet I’ll hammer it out.</li>
  <li>My brain I’ll prove the female to my soul,</li>
  <li>My soul the father; and these two beget</li>
  <li>A generation of still-breeding thoughts,</li>
  <li>And these same thoughts people this little world,</li>
  <li class="number">In humours like the people of this world,</li>
  <li>For no thought is contented. The better sort,</li>
  <li>As thoughts of things divine, are intermix’d</li>
  <li>With scruples and do set the word itself</li>
  <li>Against the word:</li>
  <li class="number">As thus, ’Come, little ones,’ and then again,</li>
  <li>’It is as hard to come as for a camel</li>
  <li>To thread the postern of a small needle’s eye.’</li>
  <li>Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot</li>
  <li>Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails</li>
  <li class="number">May tear a passage through the flinty ribs</li>
  <li>Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,</li>
  <li>And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.</li>
  <li>Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves</li>
  <li>That they are not the first of fortune’s slaves,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars</li>
  <li>Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,</li>
  <li>That many have and others must sit there;</li>
  <li>And in this thought they find a kind of ease,</li>
  <li>Bearing their own misfortunes on the back</li>
  <li class="number">Of such as have before endured the like.</li>
  <li>Thus play I in one person many people,</li>
  <li>And none contented: sometimes am I king;</li>
  <li>Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,</li>
  <li>And so I am: then crushing penury</li>
  <li class="number">Persuades me I was better when a king;</li>
  <li>Then am I king’d again: and by and by</li>
  <li>Think that I am unking’d by Bolingbroke,</li>
  <li>And straight am nothing: but whate’er I be,</li>
  <li>Nor I nor any man that but man is</li>
  <li class="number">With nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased</li>
  <li>With being nothing. Music do I hear?</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Music</li>

  <li>Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.</li>
  <li>I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;</li>

  <li>Whereto my finger, like a dial’s point,</li>
  <li>Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.</li>
  <li class="number">Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is</li>
  <li>Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,</li>
  <li>Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans</li>
  <li>Show minutes, times, and hours: but my time</li>
  <li>Runs posting on in Bolingbroke’s proud joy,</li>
  <li class="number">While I stand fooling here, his Jack o’ the clock.</li>
  <li>This music mads me; let it sound no more;</li>

<h3>SCENE VI.  Windsor castle.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Flourish. Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE, DUKE OF YORK,
with other Lords, and Attendants</div>

<ol data-speaker="HENRY BOLINGBROKE">
  <li>Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear</li>
  <li>Is that the rebels have consumed with fire</li>
  <li>Our town of Cicester in Gloucestershire;</li>
  <li>But whether they be ta’en or slain we hear not.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter NORTHUMBERLAND</li>
  <li class="number">Welcome, my lord what is the news?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTHUMBERLAND">
  <li>First, to thy sacred state wish I all happiness.</li>
  <li>The next news is, I have to London sent</li>
  <li>The heads of Oxford, Salisbury, Blunt, and Kent:</li>
  <li>The manner of their taking may appear</li>
  <li class="number">At large discoursed in this paper here.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HENRY BOLINGBROKE">
  <li>We thank thee, gentle Percy, for thy pains;</li>
  <li>And to thy worth will add right worthy gains.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter LORD FITZWATER</div>

<ol data-speaker="LORD FITZWATER">
  <li>My lord, I have from Oxford sent to London</li>
  <li>The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely,</li>
  <li class="number">Two of the dangerous consorted traitors</li>
  <li>That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HENRY BOLINGBROKE">
  <li>Thy pains, Fitzwater, shall not be forgot;</li>
  <li>Right noble is thy merit, well I wot.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter HENRY PERCY, and the BISHOP OF CARLISLE</div>

<ol data-speaker="HENRY PERCY">
  <li>The grand conspirator, Abbot of Westminster,</li>
  <li class="number">With clog of conscience and sour melancholy</li>
  <li>Hath yielded up his body to the grave;</li>
  <li>But here is Carlisle living, to abide</li>
  <li>Thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HENRY BOLINGBROKE">
  <li>Carlisle, this is your doom:</li>
  <li class="number">Choose out some secret place, some reverend room,</li>
  <li>More than thou hast, and with it joy thy life;</li>
  <li>So as thou livest in peace, die free from strife:</li>
  <li>For though mine enemy thou hast ever been,</li>
  <li>High sparks of honour in thee have I seen.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter EXTON, with persons bearing a coffin</div>

<ol data-speaker="EXTON">
  <li class="number">Great king, within this coffin I present</li>
  <li>Thy buried fear: herein all breathless lies</li>
  <li>The mightiest of thy greatest enemies,</li>
  <li>Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HENRY BOLINGBROKE">
  <li>Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought</li>
  <li class="number">A deed of slander with thy fatal hand</li>
  <li>Upon my head and all this famous land.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EXTON">
  <li>From your own mouth, my lord, did I this deed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HENRY BOLINGBROKE">
  <li>They love not poison that do poison need,</li>
  <li>Nor do I thee: though I did wish him dead,</li>
  <li class="number">I hate the murderer, love him murdered.</li>
  <li>The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour,</li>
  <li>But neither my good word nor princely favour:</li>
  <li>With Cain go wander through shades of night,</li>
  <li>And never show thy head by day nor light.</li>
  <li class="number">Lords, I protest, my soul is full of woe,</li>
  <li>That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow:</li>
  <li>Come, mourn with me for that I do lament,</li>
  <li>And put on sullen black incontinent:</li>
  <li>I’ll make a voyage to the Holy Land,</li>
  <li class="number">To wash this blood off from my guilty hand:</li>
  <li>March sadly after; grace my mournings here;</li>
  <li>In weeping after this untimely bier.</li>
