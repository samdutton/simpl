<h3>SCENE I.  Athens. A hall in Timon’s house.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter Poet, Painter, Jeweller, Merchant, and
others, at several doors</div>

<ol data-speaker="Poet">
  <li>Good day, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Painter">
  <li>I am glad you’re well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Poet">
  <li>I have not seen you long: how goes the world?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Painter">
  <li>It wears, sir, as it grows.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Poet">
  <li class="number">Ay, that’s well known:</li>
  <li>But what particular rarity? what strange,</li>
  <li>Which manifold record not matches? See,</li>
  <li>Magic of bounty! all these spirits thy power</li>
  <li>Hath conjured to attend. I know the merchant.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Painter">
  <li class="number">I know them both; th’ other’s a jeweller.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Merchant">
  <li>O, ’tis a worthy lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Jeweller">
  <li>Nay, that’s most fix’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Merchant">
  <li>A most incomparable man, breathed, as it were,</li>
  <li>To an untirable and continuate goodness:</li>
  <li class="number">He passes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Jeweller:">
  <li>I have a jewel here — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Merchant">
  <li>O, pray, let’s see’t: for the Lord Timon, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Jeweller:">
  <li>If he will touch the estimate: but, for that — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Poet">
  <li><stagedir>Reciting to himself</stagedir>  ’When we for recompense have</li>
  <li class="number">praised the vile,</li>
  <li>It stains the glory in that happy verse</li>
  <li>Which aptly sings the good.’</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Merchant">
  <li>’Tis a good form.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Looking at the jewel</div>

<ol data-speaker="Jeweller">
  <li>And rich: here is a water, look ye.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Painter">
  <li class="number">You are rapt, sir, in some work, some dedication</li>
  <li>To the great lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Poet">
  <li>A thing slipp’d idly from me.</li>
  <li>Our poesy is as a gum, which oozes</li>
  <li>From whence ’tis nourish’d: the fire i’ the flint</li>
  <li class="number">Shows not till it be struck; our gentle flame</li>
  <li>Provokes itself and like the current flies</li>
  <li>Each bound it chafes. What have you there?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Painter">
  <li>A picture, sir. When comes your book forth?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Poet">
  <li>Upon the heels of my presentment, sir.</li>
  <li class="number">Let’s see your piece.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Painter">
  <li>’Tis a good piece.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Poet">
  <li>So ’tis: this comes off well and excellent.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Painter">
  <li>Indifferent.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Poet">
  <li>Admirable: how this grace</li>
  <li class="number">Speaks his own standing! what a mental power</li>
  <li>This eye shoots forth! how big imagination</li>
  <li>Moves in this lip! to the dumbness of the gesture</li>
  <li>One might interpret.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Painter">
  <li>It is a pretty mocking of the life.</li>
  <li class="number">Here is a touch; is’t good?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Poet">
  <li>I will say of it,</li>
  <li>It tutors nature: artificial strife</li>
  <li>Lives in these touches, livelier than life.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter certain Senators, and pass over</div>

<ol data-speaker="Painter">
  <li>How this lord is follow’d!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Poet">
  <li class="number">The senators of Athens: happy man!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Painter">
  <li>Look, more!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Poet">
  <li>You see this confluence, this great flood</li>
  <li>of visitors.</li>
  <li>I have, in this rough work, shaped out a man,</li>
  <li class="number">Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug</li>
  <li>With amplest entertainment: my free drift</li>
  <li>Halts not particularly, but moves itself</li>
  <li>In a wide sea of wax: no levell’d malice</li>
  <li>Infects one comma in the course I hold;</li>
  <li class="number">But flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on,</li>
  <li>Leaving no tract behind.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Painter">
  <li>How shall I understand you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Poet">
  <li>I will unbolt to you.</li>
  <li>You see how all conditions, how all minds,</li>
  <li class="number">As well of glib and slippery creatures as</li>
  <li>Of grave and austere quality, tender down</li>
  <li>Their services to Lord Timon: his large fortune</li>
  <li>Upon his good and gracious nature hanging</li>
  <li>Subdues and properties to his love and tendance</li>
  <li class="number">All sorts of hearts; yea, from the glass-faced flatterer</li>
  <li>To Apemantus, that few things loves better</li>
  <li>Than to abhor himself: even he drops down</li>
  <li>The knee before him, and returns in peace</li>
  <li>Most rich in Timon’s nod.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Painter">
  <li class="number">I saw them speak together.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Poet">
  <li>Sir, I have upon a high and pleasant hill</li>
  <li>Feign’d Fortune to be throned: the base o’ the mount</li>
  <li>Is rank’d with all deserts, all kind of natures,</li>
  <li>That labour on the bosom of this sphere</li>
  <li class="number">To propagate their states: amongst them all,</li>
  <li>Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix’d,</li>
  <li>One do I personate of Lord Timon’s frame,</li>
  <li>Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her;</li>
  <li>Whose present grace to present slaves and servants</li>
  <li class="number">Translates his rivals.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Painter">
  <li>’Tis conceived to scope.</li>
  <li>This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks,</li>
  <li>With one man beckon’d from the rest below,</li>
  <li>Bowing his head against the sleepy mount</li>
  <li class="number">To climb his happiness, would be well express’d</li>
  <li>In our condition.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Poet">
  <li>Nay, sir, but hear me on.</li>
  <li>All those which were his fellows but of late,</li>
  <li>Some better than his value, on the moment</li>
  <li class="number">Follow his strides, his lobbies fill with tendance,</li>
  <li>Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear,</li>
  <li>Make sacred even his stirrup, and through him</li>
  <li>Drink the free air.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Painter">
  <li>Ay, marry, what of these?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Poet">
  <li class="number">When Fortune in her shift and change of mood</li>
  <li>Spurns down her late beloved, all his dependants</li>
  <li>Which labour’d after him to the mountain’s top</li>
  <li>Even on their knees and hands, let him slip down,</li>
  <li>Not one accompanying his declining foot.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Painter">
  <li class="number">’Tis common:</li>
  <li>A thousand moral paintings I can show</li>
  <li>That shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortune’s</li>
  <li>More pregnantly than words. Yet you do well</li>
  <li>To show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen</li>
  <li class="number">The foot above the head.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Trumpets sound. Enter TIMON, addressing himself
courteously to every suitor; a Messenger from
VENTIDIUS talking with him; LUCILIUS and other
servants following</div>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>Imprison’d is he, say you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Messenger">
  <li>Ay, my good lord: five talents is his debt,</li>
  <li>His means most short, his creditors most strait:</li>
  <li>Your honourable letter he desires</li>
  <li class="number">To those have shut him up; which failing,</li>
  <li>Periods his comfort.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>Noble Ventidius! Well;</li>
  <li>I am not of that feather to shake off</li>
  <li>My friend when he must need me. I do know him</li>
  <li class="number">A gentleman that well deserves a help:</li>
  <li>Which he shall have: I’ll pay the debt,</li>
  <li>and free him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Messenger">
  <li>Your lordship ever binds him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>Commend me to him: I will send his ransom;</li>
  <li class="number">And being enfranchised, bid him come to me.</li>
  <li>’Tis not enough to help the feeble up,</li>
  <li>But to support him after. Fare you well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Messenger">
  <li>All happiness to your honour!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter an old Athenian</div>

<ol data-speaker="Old Athenian">
  <li>Lord Timon, hear me speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li class="number">Freely, good father.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Old Athenian">
  <li>Thou hast a servant named Lucilius.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>I have so: what of him?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Old Athenian">
  <li>Most noble Timon, call the man before thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>Attends he here, or no? Lucilius!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCILIUS">
  <li class="number">Here, at your lordship’s service.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Old Athenian">
  <li>This fellow here, Lord Timon, this thy creature,</li>
  <li>By night frequents my house. I am a man</li>
  <li>That from my first have been inclined to thrift;</li>
  <li>And my estate deserves an heir more raised</li>
  <li class="number">Than one which holds a trencher.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>Well; what further?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Old Athenian">
  <li>One only daughter have I, no kin else,</li>
  <li>On whom I may confer what I have got:</li>
  <li>The maid is fair, o’ the youngest for a bride,</li>
  <li class="number">And I have bred her at my dearest cost</li>
  <li>In qualities of the best. This man of thine</li>
  <li>Attempts her love: I prithee, noble lord,</li>
  <li>Join with me to forbid him her resort;</li>
  <li>Myself have spoke in vain.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li class="number">The man is honest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Old Athenian">
  <li>Therefore he will be, Timon:</li>
  <li>His honesty rewards him in itself;</li>
  <li>It must not bear my daughter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>Does she love him?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Old Athenian">
  <li class="number">She is young and apt:</li>
  <li>Our own precedent passions do instruct us</li>
  <li>What levity’s in youth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li><stagedir>To LUCILIUS</stagedir>           Love you the maid?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCILIUS">
  <li>Ay, my good lord, and she accepts of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Old Athenian">
  <li class="number">If in her marriage my consent be missing,</li>
  <li>I call the gods to witness, I will choose</li>
  <li>Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world,</li>
  <li>And dispossess her all.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>How shall she be endow’d,</li>
  <li class="number">if she be mated with an equal husband?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Old Athenian">
  <li>Three talents on the present; in future, all.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>This gentleman of mine hath served me long:</li>
  <li>To build his fortune I will strain a little,</li>
  <li>For ’tis a bond in men. Give him thy daughter:</li>
  <li class="number">What you bestow, in him I’ll counterpoise,</li>
  <li>And make him weigh with her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Old Athenian">
  <li>Most noble lord,</li>
  <li>Pawn me to this your honour, she is his.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>My hand to thee; mine honour on my promise.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCILIUS">
  <li class="number">Humbly I thank your lordship: never may</li>
  <li>The state or fortune fall into my keeping,</li>
  <li>Which is not owed to you!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt LUCILIUS and Old Athenian</div>

<ol data-speaker="Poet">
  <li>Vouchsafe my labour, and long live your lordship!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>I thank you; you shall hear from me anon:</li>
  <li class="number">Go not away. What have you there, my friend?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Painter">
  <li>A piece of painting, which I do beseech</li>
  <li>Your lordship to accept.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>Painting is welcome.</li>
  <li>The painting is almost the natural man;</li>
  <li class="number">or since dishonour traffics with man’s nature,</li>
  <li>He is but outside: these pencill’d figures are</li>
  <li>Even such as they give out. I like your work;</li>
  <li>And you shall find I like it: wait attendance</li>
  <li>Till you hear further from me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Painter">
  <li class="number">The gods preserve ye!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>Well fare you, gentleman: give me your hand;</li>
  <li>We must needs dine together. Sir, your jewel</li>
  <li>Hath suffer’d under praise.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Jeweller">
  <li>What, my lord! dispraise?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li class="number">A more satiety of commendations.</li>
  <li>If I should pay you for’t as ’tis extoll’d,</li>
  <li>It would unclew me quite.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Jeweller">
  <li>My lord, ’tis rated</li>
  <li>As those which sell would give: but you well know,</li>
  <li class="number">Things of like value differing in the owners</li>
  <li>Are prized by their masters: believe’t, dear lord,</li>
  <li>You mend the jewel by the wearing it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>Well mock’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Merchant">
  <li>No, my good lord; he speaks the common tongue,</li>
  <li class="number">Which all men speak with him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>Look, who comes here: will you be chid?</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter APEMANTUS</div>

<ol data-speaker="Jeweller">
  <li>We’ll bear, with your lordship.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Merchant">
  <li>He’ll spare none.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>Good morrow to thee, gentle Apemantus!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEMANTUS">
  <li class="number">Till I be gentle, stay thou for thy good morrow;</li>
  <li>When thou art Timon’s dog, and these knaves honest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>Why dost thou call them knaves? thou know’st them not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEMANTUS">
  <li>Are they not Athenians?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>Yes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEMANTUS">
  <li class="number">Then I repent not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Jeweller">
  <li>You know me, Apemantus?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEMANTUS">
  <li>Thou know’st I do: I call’d thee by thy name.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>Thou art proud, Apemantus.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEMANTUS">
  <li>Of nothing so much as that I am not like Timon.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li class="number">Whither art going?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEMANTUS">
  <li>To knock out an honest Athenian’s brains.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>That’s a deed thou’lt die for.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEMANTUS">
  <li>Right, if doing nothing be death by the law.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>How likest thou this picture, Apemantus?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEMANTUS">
  <li class="number">The best, for the innocence.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>Wrought he not well that painted it?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEMANTUS">
  <li>He wrought better that made the painter; and yet</li>
  <li>he’s but a filthy piece of work.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Painter">
  <li>You’re a dog.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEMANTUS">
  <li class="number">Thy mother’s of my generation: what’s she, if I be a dog?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>Wilt dine with me, Apemantus?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEMANTUS">
  <li>No; I eat not lords.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>An thou shouldst, thou ’ldst anger ladies.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEMANTUS">
  <li>O, they eat lords; so they come by great bellies.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li class="number">That’s a lascivious apprehension.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEMANTUS">
  <li>So thou apprehendest it: take it for thy labour.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>How dost thou like this jewel, Apemantus?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEMANTUS">
  <li>Not so well as plain-dealing, which will not cost a</li>
  <li>man a doit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li class="number">What dost thou think ’tis worth?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEMANTUS">
  <li>Not worth my thinking. How now, poet!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Poet">
  <li>How now, philosopher!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEMANTUS">
  <li>Thou liest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Poet">
  <li>Art not one?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEMANTUS">
  <li class="number">Yes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Poet">
  <li>Then I lie not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEMANTUS">
  <li>Art not a poet?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Poet">
  <li>Yes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEMANTUS">
  <li>Then thou liest: look in thy last work, where thou</li>
  <li class="number">hast feigned him a worthy fellow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Poet">
  <li>That’s not feigned; he is so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEMANTUS">
  <li>Yes, he is worthy of thee, and to pay thee for thy</li>
  <li>labour: he that loves to be flattered is worthy o’</li>
  <li>the flatterer. Heavens, that I were a lord!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li class="number">What wouldst do then, Apemantus?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEMANTUS">
  <li>E’en as Apemantus does now; hate a lord with my heart.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>What, thyself?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEMANTUS">
  <li>Ay.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>Wherefore?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEMANTUS">
  <li class="number">That I had no angry wit to be a lord.</li>
  <li>Art not thou a merchant?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Merchant">
  <li>Ay, Apemantus.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEMANTUS">
  <li>Traffic confound thee, if the gods will not!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Merchant">
  <li>If traffic do it, the gods do it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEMANTUS">
  <li class="number">Traffic’s thy god; and thy god confound thee!</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Trumpet sounds. Enter a Messenger</div>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>What trumpet’s that?</li>

<ol data-speaker="Messenger">

  <li class="number">What time o’ day is’t, Apemantus?</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  A banqueting-room in Timon’s house.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Hautboys playing loud music. A great banquet
served in; FLAVIUS and others attending; then enter
TIMON, ALCIBIADES, Lords, Senators, and VENTIDIUS.
Then comes, dropping, after all, APEMANTUS,
discontentedly, like himself</div>

<ol data-speaker="VENTIDIUS">
  <li>Most honour’d Timon,</li>
  <li>It hath pleased the gods to remember my father’s age,</li>
  <li>And call him to long peace.</li>
  <li>He is gone happy, and has left me rich:</li>
  <li class="number">Then, as in grateful virtue I am bound</li>
  <li>To your free heart, I do return those talents,</li>
  <li>Doubled with thanks and service, from whose help</li>
  <li>I derived liberty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>O, by no means,</li>
  <li class="number">Honest Ventidius; you mistake my love:</li>
  <li>I gave it freely ever; and there’s none</li>
  <li>Can truly say he gives, if he receives:</li>
  <li>If our betters play at that game, we must not dare</li>
  <li>To imitate them; faults that are rich are fair.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VENTIDIUS">
  <li class="number">A noble spirit!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>Nay, my lords,</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">They all stand ceremoniously looking on TIMON</li>
  <li>Ceremony was but devised at first</li>
  <li>To set a gloss on faint deeds, hollow welcomes,</li>
  <li>Recanting goodness, sorry ere ’tis shown;</li>
  <li class="number">But where there is true friendship, there needs none.</li>
  <li>Pray, sit; more welcome are ye to my fortunes</li>
  <li>Than my fortunes to me.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">They sit</div>

<ol data-speaker="First Lord">
  <li>My lord, we always have confess’d it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEMANTUS">
  <li>Ho, ho, confess’d it! hang’d it, have you not?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li class="number">O, Apemantus, you are welcome.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEMANTUS">
  <li>No;</li>
  <li>You shall not make me welcome:</li>
  <li>I come to have thee thrust me out of doors.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>Fie, thou’rt a churl; ye’ve got a humour there</li>
  <li class="number">Does not become a man: ’tis much to blame.</li>
  <li>They say, my lords, ’ira furor brevis est;’ but yond</li>
  <li>man is ever angry. Go, let him have a table by</li>
  <li>himself, for he does neither affect company, nor is</li>
  <li>he fit for’t, indeed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEMANTUS">
  <li class="number">Let me stay at thine apperil, Timon: I come to</li>
  <li>observe; I give thee warning on’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>I take no heed of thee; thou’rt an Athenian,</li>
  <li>therefore welcome: I myself would have no power;</li>
  <li>prithee, let my meat make thee silent.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEMANTUS">
  <li class="number">I scorn thy meat; ’twould choke me, for I should</li>
  <li>ne’er flatter thee. O you gods, what a number of</li>
  <li>men eat Timon, and he sees ’em not! It grieves me</li>
  <li>to see so many dip their meat in one man’s blood;</li>
  <li>and all the madness is, he cheers them up too.</li>
  <li class="number">I wonder men dare trust themselves with men:</li>
  <li>Methinks they should invite them without knives;</li>
  <li>Good for their meat, and safer for their lives.</li>
  <li>There’s much example for’t; the fellow that sits</li>
  <li>next him now, parts bread with him, pledges the</li>
  <li class="number">breath of him in a divided draught, is the readiest</li>
  <li>man to kill him: ’t has been proved. If I were a</li>
  <li>huge man, I should fear to drink at meals;</li>
  <li>Lest they should spy my windpipe’s dangerous notes:</li>
  <li>Great men should drink with harness on their throats.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li class="number">My lord, in heart; and let the health go round.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Lord">
  <li>Let it flow this way, my good lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEMANTUS">
  <li>Flow this way! A brave fellow! he keeps his tides</li>
  <li>well. Those healths will make thee and thy state</li>
  <li>look ill, Timon. Here’s that which is too weak to</li>
  <li class="number">be a sinner, honest water, which ne’er left man i’ the mire:</li>
  <li>This and my food are equals; there’s no odds:</li>
  <li>Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods.</li>
  <li>Apemantus’ grace.</li>
  <li>Immortal gods, I crave no pelf;</li>
  <li class="number">I pray for no man but myself:</li>
  <li>Grant I may never prove so fond,</li>
  <li>To trust man on his oath or bond;</li>
  <li>Or a harlot, for her weeping;</li>
  <li>Or a dog, that seems a-sleeping:</li>
  <li class="number">Or a keeper with my freedom;</li>
  <li>Or my friends, if I should need ’em.</li>
  <li>Amen. So fall to’t:</li>
  <li>Rich men sin, and I eat root.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Eats and drinks</li>
  <li>Much good dich thy good heart, Apemantus!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li class="number">Captain Alcibiades, your heart’s in the field now.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALCIBIADES">
  <li>My heart is ever at your service, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>You had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than a</li>
  <li>dinner of friends.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALCIBIADES">
  <li>So the were bleeding-new, my lord, there’s no meat</li>
  <li class="number">like ’em: I could wish my best friend at such a feast.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEMANTUS">
  <li>Would all those fatterers were thine enemies then,</li>
  <li>that then thou mightst kill ’em and bid me to ’em!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Lord">
  <li>Might we but have that happiness, my lord, that you</li>
  <li>would once use our hearts, whereby we might express</li>
  <li class="number">some part of our zeals, we should think ourselves</li>
  <li>for ever perfect.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>O, no doubt, my good friends, but the gods</li>
  <li>themselves have provided that I shall have much help</li>
  <li>from you: how had you been my friends else? why</li>
  <li class="number">have you that charitable title from thousands, did</li>
  <li>not you chiefly belong to my heart? I have told</li>
  <li>more of you to myself than you can with modesty</li>
  <li>speak in your own behalf; and thus far I confirm</li>
  <li>you. O you gods, think I, what need we have any</li>
  <li class="number">friends, if we should ne’er have need of ’em? they</li>
  <li>were the most needless creatures living, should we</li>
  <li>ne’er have use for ’em, and would most resemble</li>
  <li>sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their</li>
  <li>sounds to themselves. Why, I have often wished</li>
  <li class="number">myself poorer, that I might come nearer to you. We</li>
  <li>are born to do benefits: and what better or</li>
  <li>properer can we can our own than the riches of our</li>
  <li>friends? O, what a precious comfort ’tis, to have</li>
  <li>so many, like brothers, commanding one another’s</li>
  <li class="number">fortunes! O joy, e’en made away ere ’t can be born!</li>
  <li>Mine eyes cannot hold out water, methinks: to</li>
  <li>forget their faults, I drink to you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEMANTUS">
  <li>Thou weepest to make them drink, Timon.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Lord">
  <li>Joy had the like conception in our eyes</li>
  <li class="number">And at that instant like a babe sprung up.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEMANTUS">
  <li>Ho, ho! I laugh to think that babe a bastard.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Third Lord">
  <li>I promise you, my lord, you moved me much.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="APEMANTUS">
  <li>Much!</li>

  <li>Ladies! what are their wills?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Servant">
  <li>There comes with them a forerunner, my lord, which</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Music. Re-enter Cupid with a mask of Ladies
as Amazons, with lutes in their hands,
dancing and playing</div>

<ol data-speaker="APEMANTUS">
  <li>Hoy-day, what a sweep of vanity comes this way!</li>
  <li>They dance! they are mad women.</li>
  <li>Like madness is the glory of this life.</li>
  <li>As this pomp shows to a little oil and root.</li>
  <li class="number">We make ourselves fools, to disport ourselves;</li>

  <li>Who lives that’s not depraved or depraves?</li>
  <li class="number">Who dies, that bears not one spurn to their graves</li>
  <li>Of their friends’ gift?</li>
  <li>I should fear those that dance before me now</li>

  <li>Men shut their doors against a setting sun.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">The Lords rise from table, with much adoring of

  <li class="number">You have done our pleasures much grace, fair ladies,</li>

  <li>It turns in less than two nights? O you gods,</li>
  <li>I feel master’s passion! this slave,</li>

  <li>Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment,</li>
  <li>When he is turn’d to poison?</li>
  <li>O, may diseases only work upon’t!</li>
  <li>And, when he’s sick to death, let not that part of nature</li>
  <li class="number">Which my lord paid for, be of any power</li>
  <li>To expel sickness, but prolong his hour!</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  A public place.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter LUCILIUS, with three Strangers</div>

<ol data-speaker="LUCILIUS">
  <li>Who, the Lord Timon? he is my very good friend, and</li>
  <li>an honourable gentleman.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Stranger">
  <li>We know him for no less, though we are but strangers</li>
  <li>to him. But I can tell you one thing, my lord, and</li>
  <li class="number">which I hear from common rumours: now Lord Timon’s</li>
  <li>happy hours are done and past, and his estate</li>
  <li>shrinks from him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCILIUS">
  <li>Fie, no, do not believe it; he cannot want for money.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Stranger">
  <li>But believe you this, my lord, that, not long ago,</li>
  <li class="number">one of his men was with the Lord Lucullus to borrow</li>
  <li>so many talents, nay, urged extremely for’t and</li>
  <li>showed what necessity belonged to’t, and yet was denied.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCILIUS">
  <li>How!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Stranger">
  <li>I tell you, denied, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCILIUS">
  <li class="number">What a strange case was that! now, before the gods,</li>
  <li>I am ashamed on’t. Denied that honourable man!</li>
  <li>there was very little honour showed in’t. For my own</li>
  <li>part, I must needs confess, I have received some</li>
  <li>small kindnesses from him, as money, plate, jewels</li>
  <li class="number">and such-like trifles, nothing comparing to his;</li>
  <li>yet, had he mistook him and sent to me, I should</li>
  <li>ne’er have denied his occasion so many talents.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter SERVILIUS</div>

<ol data-speaker="SERVILIUS">
  <li>See, by good hap, yonder’s my lord;</li>
  <li>I have sweat to see his honour. My honoured lord — </li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">To LUCIUS</div>

<ol data-speaker="LUCILIUS">
  <li class="number">Servilius! you are kindly met, sir. Fare thee well:</li>
  <li>commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord, my very</li>
  <li>exquisite friend.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SERVILIUS">
  <li>May it please your honour, my lord hath sent — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCILIUS">
  <li>Ha! what has he sent? I am so much endeared to</li>
  <li class="number">that lord; he’s ever sending: how shall I thank</li>
  <li>him, thinkest thou? And what has he sent now?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SERVILIUS">
  <li>Has only sent his present occasion now, my lord;</li>
  <li>requesting your lordship to supply his instant use</li>
  <li>with so many talents.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCILIUS">
  <li class="number">I know his lordship is but merry with me;</li>
  <li>He cannot want fifty five hundred talents.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SERVILIUS">
  <li>But in the mean time he wants less, my lord.</li>
  <li>If his occasion were not virtuous,</li>
  <li>I should not urge it half so faithfully.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCILIUS">
  <li class="number">Dost thou speak seriously, Servilius?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SERVILIUS">
  <li>Upon my soul,’tis true, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCILIUS">
  <li>What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself</li>
  <li>against such a good time, when I might ha’ shown</li>
  <li>myself honourable! how unluckily it happened, that I</li>
  <li class="number">should purchase the day before for a little part,</li>
  <li>and undo a great deal of honoured! Servilius, now,</li>
  <li>before the gods, I am not able to do — the more</li>
  <li>beast, I say: — I was sending to use Lord Timon</li>
  <li>myself, these gentlemen can witness! but I would</li>
  <li class="number">not, for the wealth of Athens, I had done’t now.</li>
  <li>Commend me bountifully to his good lordship; and I</li>
  <li>hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me,</li>
  <li>because I have no power to be kind: and tell him</li>
  <li>this from me, I count it one of my greatest</li>
  <li class="number">afflictions, say, that I cannot pleasure such an</li>
  <li>honourable gentleman. Good Servilius, will you</li>
  <li>befriend me so far, as to use mine own words to him?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SERVILIUS">
  <li>Yes, sir, I shall.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCILIUS">
  <li>I’ll look you out a good turn, Servilius.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exit SERVILIUS</li>
  <li class="number">True as you said, Timon is shrunk indeed;</li>
  <li>And he that’s once denied will hardly speed.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<ol data-speaker="First Stranger">
  <li>Do you observe this, Hostilius?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Stranger">
  <li>Ay, too well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Stranger">
  <li>Why, this is the world’s soul; and just of the</li>
  <li class="number">same piece</li>
  <li>Is every flatterer’s spirit. Who can call him</li>
  <li>His friend that dips in the same dish? for, in</li>
  <li>My knowing, Timon has been this lord’s father,</li>
  <li>And kept his credit with his purse,</li>
  <li class="number">Supported his estate; nay, Timon’s money</li>
  <li>Has paid his men their wages: he ne’er drinks,</li>
  <li>But Timon’s silver treads upon his lip;</li>
  <li>And yet — O, see the monstrousness of man</li>
  <li>When he looks out in an ungrateful shape! — </li>
  <li class="number">He does deny him, in respect of his,</li>
  <li>What charitable men afford to beggars.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Third Stranger">
  <li>Religion groans at it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Stranger">
  <li>For mine own part,</li>
  <li>I never tasted Timon in my life,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor came any of his bounties over me,</li>
  <li>To mark me for his friend; yet, I protest,</li>
  <li>For his right noble mind, illustrious virtue</li>
  <li>And honourable carriage,</li>
  <li>Had his necessity made use of me,</li>
  <li class="number">I would have put my wealth into donation,</li>
  <li>And the best half should have return’d to him,</li>
  <li>So much I love his heart: but, I perceive,</li>
  <li>Men must learn now with pity to dispense;</li>
  <li>For policy sits above conscience.</li>

<ol data-speaker="SEMPRONIUS">
  <li>Must he needs trouble me in ’t — hum! — ’bove</li>

  <li>He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus;</li>

  <li>My lord,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEMPRONIUS">
  <li class="number">How! have they denied him?</li>
  <li>Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him?</li>
  <li>And does he send to me? Three? hum!</li>
  <li>It shows but little love or judgment in him:</li>
  <li>Must I be his last refuge! His friends, like</li>
  <li class="number">physicians,</li>
  <li>Thrive, give him over: must I take the cure upon me?</li>
  <li>Has much disgraced me in’t; I’m angry at him,</li>
  <li>That might have known my place: I see no sense for’t,</li>
  <li>But his occasion might have woo’d me first;</li>
  <li class="number">For, in my conscience, I was the first man</li>
  <li>That e’er received gift from him:</li>
  <li>And does he think so backwardly of me now,</li>
  <li>That I’ll requite its last? No:</li>
  <li>So it may prove an argument of laughter</li>
  <li class="number">To the rest, and ’mongst lords I be thought a fool.</li>
  <li>I’ld rather than the worth of thrice the sum,</li>
  <li>Had sent to me first, but for my mind’s sake;</li>
  <li>I’d such a courage to do him good. But now return,</li>

  <li>Excellent! Your lordship’s a goodly villain. The</li>

  <li>think but, in the end, the villainies of man will</li>

  <li>appear foul! takes virtuous copies to be wicked,</li>
  <li>like those that under hot ardent zeal would set</li>
  <li>whole realms on fire: Of such a nature is his</li>
  <li>politic love.</li>
  <li class="number">This was my lord’s best hope; now all are fled,</li>

  <li>Doors, that were ne’er acquainted with their wards</li>

  <li>My lord — </li>

<ol data-speaker="First Senator">
  <li class="number">You cannot make gross sins look clear:</li>
  <li>To revenge is no valour, but to bear.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALCIBIADES">
  <li>My lords, then, under favour, pardon me,</li>
  <li>If I speak like a captain.</li>
  <li>Why do fond men expose themselves to battle,</li>
  <li class="number">And not endure all threats? sleep upon’t,</li>
  <li>And let the foes quietly cut their throats,</li>
  <li>Without repugnancy? If there be</li>
  <li>Such valour in the bearing, what make we</li>
  <li>Abroad? why then, women are more valiant</li>
  <li class="number">That stay at home, if bearing carry it,</li>
  <li>And the ass more captain than the lion, the felon</li>
  <li>Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,</li>
  <li>If wisdom be in suffering. O my lords,</li>
  <li>As you are great, be pitifully good:</li>
  <li class="number">Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?</li>
  <li>To kill, I grant, is sin’s extremest gust;</li>
  <li>But, in defence, by mercy, ’tis most just.</li>
  <li>To be in anger is impiety;</li>
  <li>But who is man that is not angry?</li>
  <li class="number">Weigh but the crime with this.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Senator">
  <li>You breathe in vain.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALCIBIADES">
  <li>In vain! his service done</li>
  <li>At Lacedaemon and Byzantium</li>
  <li>Were a sufficient briber for his life.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Senator">
  <li class="number">What’s that?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALCIBIADES">
  <li>I say, my lords, he has done fair service,</li>
  <li>And slain in fight many of your enemies:</li>
  <li>How full of valour did he bear himself</li>
  <li>In the last conflict, and made plenteous wounds!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Senator">
  <li class="number">He has made too much plenty with ’em;</li>
  <li>He’s a sworn rioter: he has a sin that often</li>
  <li>Drowns him, and takes his valour prisoner:</li>
  <li>If there were no foes, that were enough</li>
  <li>To overcome him: in that beastly fury</li>
  <li class="number">He has been known to commit outrages,</li>
  <li>And cherish factions: ’tis inferr’d to us,</li>
  <li>His days are foul and his drink dangerous.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Senator">
  <li>He dies.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALCIBIADES">
  <li>Hard fate! he might have died in war.</li>
  <li class="number">My lords, if not for any parts in him — </li>
  <li>Though his right arm might purchase his own time</li>
  <li>And be in debt to none — yet, more to move you,</li>
  <li>Take my deserts to his, and join ’em both:</li>
  <li>And, for I know your reverend ages love</li>
  <li class="number">Security, I’ll pawn my victories, all</li>
  <li>My honours to you, upon his good returns.</li>
  <li>If by this crime he owes the law his life,</li>
  <li>Why, let the war receive ’t in valiant gore</li>
  <li>For law is strict, and war is nothing more.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Senator">
  <li class="number">We are for law: he dies; urge it no more,</li>
  <li>On height of our displeasure: friend or brother,</li>
  <li>He forfeits his own blood that spills another.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALCIBIADES">
  <li>Must it be so? it must not be. My lords,</li>
  <li>I do beseech you, know me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Senator">
  <li class="number">How!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALCIBIADES">
  <li>Call me to your remembrances.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Third Senator">
  <li>What!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALCIBIADES">
  <li>I cannot think but your age has forgot me;</li>
  <li>It could not else be, I should prove so base,</li>
  <li class="number">To sue, and be denied such common grace:</li>
  <li>My wounds ache at you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Senator">
  <li>Do you dare our anger?</li>
  <li>’Tis in few words, but spacious in effect;</li>
  <li>We banish thee for ever.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALCIBIADES">
  <li class="number">Banish me!</li>
  <li>Banish your dotage; banish usury,</li>
  <li>That makes the senate ugly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Senator">
  <li>If, after two days’ shine, Athens contain thee,</li>
  <li>Attend our weightier judgment. And, not to swell</li>
  <li class="number">our spirit,</li>
  <li>He shall be executed presently.</li>

  <li class="number">It comes not ill; I hate not to be banish’d;</li>
  <li>It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury,</li>

Enter divers Lords, Senators and others, at
several doors</div>

<ol data-speaker="First Lord">
  <li>The good time of day to you, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Lord">
  <li>I also wish it to you. I think this honourable lord</li>
  <li>did but try us this other day.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Lord">
  <li>Upon that were my thoughts tiring, when we</li>
  <li class="number">encountered: I hope it is not so low with him as</li>
  <li>he made it seem in the trial of his several friends.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Lord">
  <li>It should not be, by the persuasion of his new feasting.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Lord">
  <li>I should think so: he hath sent me an earnest</li>
  <li>inviting, which many my near occasions did urge me</li>
  <li class="number">to put off; but he hath conjured me beyond them, and</li>
  <li>I must needs appear.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Lord">
  <li>In like manner was I in debt to my importunate</li>
  <li>business, but he would not hear my excuse. I am</li>
  <li>sorry, when he sent to borrow of me, that my</li>
  <li class="number">provision was out.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Lord">
  <li>I am sick of that grief too, as I understand how all</li>

<ol data-speaker="Second Lord">
  <li>Every man here’s so. What would he have borrowed of</li>
  <li>you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Lord">
  <li class="number">A thousand pieces.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Lord">

  <li>With all my heart, gentlemen both; and how fare you?</li>

  <li>My most honourable lord, I am e’en sick of shame,</li>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li class="number">My worthy friends, will you draw near?</li>

<ol data-speaker="Third Lord">

<ol data-speaker="Third Lord">
  <li class="number">I do conceive.</li>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>Each man to his stool, with that spur as he would to</li>
  <li>the lip of his mistress: your diet shall be in all</li>
  <li>places alike. Make not a city feast of it, to let</li>
  <li>the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place:</li>
  <li class="number">sit, sit. The gods require our thanks.</li>
  <li>You great benefactors, sprinkle our society with</li>
  <li>thankfulness. For your own gifts, make yourselves</li>
  <li>praised: but reserve still to give, lest your</li>
  <li>deities be despised. Lend to each man enough, that</li>
  <li class="number">one need not lend to another; for, were your</li>
  <li>godheads to borrow of men, men would forsake the</li>
  <li>gods. Make the meat be beloved more than the man</li>
  <li>that gives it. Let no assembly of twenty be without</li>
  <li>a score of villains: if there sit twelve women at</li>
  <li class="number">the table, let a dozen of them be — as they are. The</li>
  <li>rest of your fees, O gods — the senators of Athens,</li>
  <li>together with the common lag of people — what is</li>
  <li>amiss in them, you gods, make suitable for</li>
  <li>destruction. For these my present friends, as they</li>
  <li class="number">are to me nothing, so in nothing bless them, and to</li>
  <li>nothing are they welcome.</li>
  <li>Uncover, dogs, and lap.</li>

  <li class="number">A beast, as thou art. The canker gnaw thy heart,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALCIBIADES">
  <li>What is thy name? Is man so hateful to thee,</li>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>I am Misanthropos, and hate mankind.</li>

  <li>I have but little gold of late, brave Timon,</li>
  <li>The want whereof doth daily make revolt</li>

  <li>In the sick air: let not thy sword skip one:</li>
  <li>Pity not honour’d age for his white beard;</li>
  <li>He is an usurer: strike me the counterfeit matron;</li>
  <li class="number">It is her habit only that is honest,</li>
  <li>Herself’s a bawd: let not the virgin’s cheek</li>
  <li>Make soft thy trenchant sword; for those milk-paps,</li>
  <li>That through the window-bars bore at men’s eyes,</li>
  <li>Are not within the leaf of pity writ,</li>
  <li class="number">But set them down horrible traitors: spare not the babe,</li>
  <li>Whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy;</li>
  <li>Think it a bastard, whom the oracle</li>

  <li>And mince it sans remorse: swear against objects;</li>
  <li class="number">Put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes;</li>
  <li>Whose proof, nor yells of mothers, maids, nor babes,</li>

  <li class="number">Confounded be thyself! Speak not, be gone.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALCIBIADES">
  <li>Hast thou gold yet? I’ll take the gold thou</li>

  <li>Enough to make a whore forswear her trade,</li>

  <li class="number">Although, I know, you ’ll swear, terribly swear</li>
  <li>Into strong shudders and to heavenly agues</li>

  <li>With burthens of the dead; — some that were hang’d,</li>
  <li class="number">No matter: — wear them, betray with them: whore still;</li>
  <li>Paint till a horse may mire upon your face,</li>

  <li>Nor sound his quillets shrilly: hoar the flamen,</li>
  <li class="number">That scolds against the quality of flesh,</li>
  <li>And not believes himself: down with the nose,</li>
  <li>Down with it flat; take the bridge quite away</li>
  <li>Of him that, his particular to foresee,</li>
  <li>Smells from the general weal: make curl’d-pate</li>
  <li class="number">ruffians bald;</li>
  <li>And let the unscarr’d braggarts of the war</li>
  <li>Derive some pain from you: plague all;</li>

  <li>Your greatest want is, you want much of meat.</li>

  <li class="number">Do villany, do, since you protest to do’t,</li>

  <li>The sun’s a thief, and with his great attraction</li>

  <li>And her pale fire she snatches from the sun:</li>

  <li>The moon into salt tears: the earth’s a thief,</li>

  <li>From general excrement: each thing’s a thief:</li>
  <li>The laws, your curb and whip, in their rough power</li>
  <li class="number">Have uncheque’d theft. Love not yourselves: away,</li>
  <li>Rob one another. There’s more gold. Cut throats:</li>
  <li>All that you meet are thieves: to Athens go,</li>

  <li>Have you forgot me, sir?</li>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li class="number">Why dost ask that? I have forgot all men;</li>
  <li>Then, if thou grant’st thou’rt a man, I have forgot thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLAVIUS">
  <li>An honest poor servant of yours.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>Then I know thee not:</li>
  <li>I never had honest man about me, I; all</li>
  <li class="number">I kept were knaves, to serve in meat to villains.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLAVIUS">
  <li>The gods are witness,</li>
  <li>Ne’er did poor steward wear a truer grief</li>
  <li>For his undone lord than mine eyes for you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>What, dost thou weep? Come nearer. Then I</li>
  <li class="number">love thee,</li>
  <li>Because thou art a woman, and disclaim’st</li>
  <li>Flinty mankind; whose eyes do never give</li>
  <li>But thorough lust and laughter. Pity’s sleeping:</li>
  <li>Strange times, that weep with laughing, not with weeping!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLAVIUS">
  <li class="number">I beg of you to know me, good my lord,</li>
  <li>To accept my grief and whilst this poor wealth lasts</li>
  <li>To entertain me as your steward still.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>Had I a steward</li>
  <li>So true, so just, and now so comfortable?</li>
  <li class="number">It almost turns my dangerous nature mild.</li>
  <li>Let me behold thy face. Surely, this man</li>

  <li>Forgive my general and exceptless rashness,</li>
  <li>You perpetual-sober gods! I do proclaim</li>
  <li class="number">One honest man — mistake me not — but one;</li>
  <li>No more, I pray — and he’s a steward.</li>
  <li>How fain would I have hated all mankind!</li>
  <li>And thou redeem’st thyself: but all, save thee,</li>
  <li>I fell with curses.</li>
  <li class="number">Methinks thou art more honest now than wise;</li>
  <li>For, by oppressing and betraying me,</li>
  <li>Thou mightst have sooner got another service:</li>
  <li>For many so arrive at second masters,</li>
  <li>Upon their first lord’s neck. But tell me true — </li>
  <li class="number">For I must ever doubt, though ne’er so sure — </li>
  <li>Is not thy kindness subtle, covetous,</li>
  <li>If not a usuring kindness, and, as rich men deal gifts,</li>
  <li>Expecting in return twenty for one?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLAVIUS">
  <li>No, my most worthy master; in whose breast</li>
  <li class="number">Doubt and suspect, alas, are placed too late:</li>
  <li>You should have fear’d false times when you did feast:</li>
  <li>Suspect still comes where an estate is least.</li>
  <li>That which I show, heaven knows, is merely love,</li>
  <li>Duty and zeal to your unmatched mind,</li>
  <li class="number">Care of your food and living; and, believe it,</li>
  <li>My most honour’d lord,</li>
  <li>For any benefit that points to me,</li>
  <li>Either in hope or present, I’ld exchange</li>
  <li>For this one wish, that you had power and wealth</li>
  <li class="number">To requite me, by making rich yourself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>Look thee, ’tis so! Thou singly honest man,</li>
  <li>Here, take: the gods out of my misery</li>
  <li>Have sent thee treasure. Go, live rich and happy;</li>
  <li>But thus condition’d: thou shalt build from men;</li>
  <li class="number">Hate all, curse all, show charity to none,</li>
  <li>But let the famish’d flesh slide from the bone,</li>
  <li>Ere thou relieve the beggar; give to dogs</li>
  <li>What thou deny’st to men; let prisons swallow ’em,</li>
  <li>Debts wither ’em to nothing; be men like</li>
  <li class="number">blasted woods,</li>
  <li>And may diseases lick up their false bloods!</li>
  <li>And so farewell and thrive.</li>

<ol data-speaker="FLAVIUS">

<h3>SCENE I.  The woods. Before Timon’s cave.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter Poet and Painter; TIMON watching
them from his cave</div>

<ol data-speaker="Painter">
  <li>As I took note of the place, it cannot be far where</li>
  <li>he abides.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Poet">
  <li>What’s to be thought of him? does the rumour hold</li>
  <li>for true, that he’s so full of gold?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Painter">
  <li class="number">Certain: Alcibiades reports it; Phrynia and</li>
  <li>Timandra had gold of him: he likewise enriched poor</li>
  <li>straggling soldiers with great quantity: ’tis said</li>
  <li>he gave unto his steward a mighty sum.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Poet">
  <li>Then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Painter">
  <li class="number">Nothing else: you shall see him a palm in Athens</li>
  <li>again, and flourish with the highest. Therefore</li>
  <li>’tis not amiss we tender our loves to him, in this</li>
  <li>supposed distress of his: it will show honestly in</li>
  <li>us; and is very likely to load our purposes with</li>
  <li class="number">what they travail for, if it be a just true report</li>
  <li>that goes of his having.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Poet">
  <li>What have you now to present unto him?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Painter">
  <li>Nothing at this time but my visitation: only I will</li>
  <li>promise him an excellent piece.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Poet">
  <li class="number">I must serve him so too, tell him of an intent</li>
  <li>that’s coming toward him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Painter">
  <li>Good as the best. Promising is the very air o’ the</li>
  <li>time: it opens the eyes of expectation:</li>
  <li>performance is ever the duller for his act; and,</li>
  <li class="number">but in the plainer and simpler kind of people, the</li>
  <li>deed of saying is quite out of use. To promise is</li>
  <li>most courtly and fashionable: performance is a kind</li>
  <li>of will or testament which argues a great sickness</li>
  <li>in his judgment that makes it.</li>

<ol data-speaker="Poet">
  <li>I am thinking what I shall say I have provided for</li>

<ol data-speaker="Poet">
  <li>Nay, let’s seek him:</li>
  <li class="number">Then do we sin against our own estate,</li>
  <li>When we may profit meet, and come too late.</li>

  <li>’Tis thou that rigg’st the bark and plough’st the foam,</li>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>Have I once lived to see two honest men?</li>

<ol data-speaker="Poet">
  <li>Sir,</li>
  <li>Having often of your open bounty tasted,</li>
  <li>Hearing you were retired, your friends fall’n off,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose thankless natures — O abhorred spirits! — </li>
  <li>Not all the whips of heaven are large enough:</li>
  <li>What! to you,</li>
  <li>Whose star-like nobleness gave life and influence</li>
  <li>To their whole being! I am rapt and cannot cover</li>
  <li class="number">The monstrous bulk of this ingratitude</li>
  <li>With any size of words.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>Let it go naked, men may see’t the better:</li>
  <li>You that are honest, by being what you are,</li>
  <li>Make them best seen and known.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Painter">
  <li class="number">He and myself</li>
  <li>Have travail’d in the great shower of your gifts,</li>
  <li>And sweetly felt it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>Ay, you are honest men.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Painter">
  <li>We are hither come to offer you our service.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li class="number">Most honest men! Why, how shall I requite you?</li>
  <li>Can you eat roots, and drink cold water? no.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Both">
  <li>What we can do, we’ll do, to do you service.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>Ye’re honest men: ye’ve heard that I have gold;</li>
  <li>I am sure you have: speak truth; ye’re honest men.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Painter">
  <li class="number">So it is said, my noble lord; but therefore</li>
  <li>Came not my friend nor I.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>Good honest men! Thou draw’st a counterfeit</li>
  <li>Best in all Athens: thou’rt, indeed, the best;</li>
  <li>Thou counterfeit’st most lively.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Painter">
  <li class="number">So, so, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>E’en so, sir, as I say. And, for thy fiction,</li>
  <li>Why, thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth</li>

  <li>But, for all this, my honest-natured friends,</li>
  <li class="number">I must needs say you have a little fault:</li>
  <li>Marry, ’tis not monstrous in you, neither wish I</li>
  <li>You take much pains to mend.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Both">
  <li>Beseech your honour</li>
  <li>To make it known to us.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li class="number">You’ll take it ill.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Both">
  <li>Most thankfully, my lord.</li>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>Will you, indeed?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Both">
  <li>Doubt it not, worthy lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>There’s never a one of you but trusts a knave,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Both">
  <li>Do we, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>Ay, and you hear him cog, see him dissemble,</li>
  <li>Know his gross patchery, love him, feed him,</li>
  <li>Keep in your bosom: yet remain assured</li>
  <li class="number">That he’s a made-up villain.</li>

<ol data-speaker="Painter">
  <li>I know none such, my lord.</li>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>Look you, I love you well; I’ll give you gold,</li>

  <li>I’ll give you gold enough.</li>

  <li>Name them, my lord, let’s know them.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>You that way and you this, but two in company;</li>
  <li class="number">Each man apart, all single and alone,</li>
  <li>Yet an arch-villain keeps him company.</li>
  <li>If where thou art two villains shall not be,</li>
  <li>Come not near him. If thou wouldst not reside</li>
  <li>But where one villain is, then him abandon.</li>
  <li class="number">Hence, pack! there’s gold; you came for gold, ye slaves:</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">To Painter</li>
  <li>You have work’d for me; there’s payment for you: hence!</li>

  <li>That nothing but himself which looks like man</li>
  <li>Is friendly with him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Senator">
  <li>Bring us to his cave:</li>
  <li>It is our part and promise to the Athenians</li>
  <li class="number">To speak with Timon.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Senator">
  <li>At all times alike</li>
  <li>Men are not still the same: ’twas time and griefs</li>
  <li>That framed him thus: time, with his fairer hand,</li>
  <li>Offering the fortunes of his former days,</li>
  <li class="number">The former man may make him. Bring us to him,</li>
  <li>And chance it as it may.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLAVIUS">
  <li>Here is his cave.</li>
  <li>Peace and content be here! Lord Timon! Timon!</li>
  <li>Look out, and speak to friends: the Athenians,</li>
  <li class="number">By two of their most reverend senate, greet thee:</li>
  <li>Speak to them, noble Timon.</li>

  <li>Thou sun, that comfort’st, burn! Speak, and</li>

  <li>Consuming it with speaking!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Senator">
  <li>Worthy Timon — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>Of none but such as you, and you of Timon.</li>

<ol data-speaker="First Senator">
  <li>The senators of Athens greet thee, Timon.</li>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li class="number">I thank them; and would send them back the plague,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Senator">
  <li>O, forget</li>
  <li>What we are sorry for ourselves in thee.</li>
  <li>The senators with one consent of love</li>
  <li class="number">Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought</li>
  <li>On special dignities, which vacant lie</li>
  <li>For thy best use and wearing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Senator">
  <li>They confess</li>
  <li>Toward thee forgetfulness too general, gross:</li>
  <li class="number">Which now the public body, which doth seldom</li>
  <li>Play the recanter, feeling in itself</li>
  <li>A lack of Timon’s aid, hath sense withal</li>
  <li>Of its own fail, restraining aid to Timon;</li>
  <li>And send forth us, to make their sorrow’d render,</li>
  <li class="number">Together with a recompense more fruitful</li>
  <li>Than their offence can weigh down by the dram;</li>
  <li>Ay, even such heaps and sums of love and wealth</li>
  <li>As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs</li>
  <li>And write in thee the figures of their love,</li>
  <li class="number">Ever to read them thine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>You witch me in it;</li>
  <li>Surprise me to the very brink of tears:</li>
  <li>Lend me a fool’s heart and a woman’s eyes,</li>
  <li>And I’ll beweep these comforts, worthy senators.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Senator">
  <li class="number">Therefore, so please thee to return with us</li>
  <li>And of our Athens, thine and ours, to take</li>
  <li>The captainship, thou shalt be met with thanks,</li>
  <li>Allow’d with absolute power and thy good name</li>
  <li>Live with authority: so soon we shall drive back</li>
  <li class="number">Of Alcibiades the approaches wild,</li>
  <li>Who, like a boar too savage, doth root up</li>
  <li>His country’s peace.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Senator">
  <li>And shakes his threatening sword</li>
  <li>Against the walls of Athens.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Senator">
  <li class="number">Therefore, Timon — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>Well, sir, I will; therefore, I will, sir; thus:</li>
  <li>If Alcibiades kill my countrymen,</li>
  <li>Let Alcibiades know this of Timon,</li>
  <li>That Timon cares not. But if be sack fair Athens,</li>
  <li class="number">And take our goodly aged men by the beards,</li>
  <li>Giving our holy virgins to the stain</li>
  <li>Of contumelious, beastly, mad-brain’d war,</li>
  <li>Then let him know, and tell him Timon speaks it,</li>
  <li>In pity of our aged and our youth,</li>
  <li class="number">I cannot choose but tell him, that I care not,</li>
  <li>And let him take’t at worst; for their knives care not,</li>
  <li>While you have throats to answer: for myself,</li>
  <li>There’s not a whittle in the unruly camp</li>
  <li>But I do prize it at my love before</li>
  <li class="number">The reverend’st throat in Athens. So I leave you</li>
  <li>To the protection of the prosperous gods,</li>
  <li>As thieves to keepers.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLAVIUS">
  <li>Stay not, all’s in vain.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>Why, I was writing of my epitaph;</li>
  <li class="number">it will be seen to-morrow: my long sickness</li>
  <li>Of health and living now begins to mend,</li>
  <li>And nothing brings me all things. Go, live still;</li>
  <li>Be Alcibiades your plague, you his,</li>
  <li>And last so long enough!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Senator">
  <li class="number">We speak in vain.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>But yet I love my country, and am not</li>
  <li>One that rejoices in the common wreck,</li>
  <li>As common bruit doth put it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Senator">
  <li>That’s well spoke.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li class="number">Commend me to my loving countrymen — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Senator">
  <li>These words become your lips as they pass</li>
  <li>thorough them.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Senator">
  <li>And enter in our ears like great triumphers</li>
  <li>In their applauding gates.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li class="number">Commend me to them,</li>
  <li>And tell them that, to ease them of their griefs,</li>
  <li>Their fears of hostile strokes, their aches, losses,</li>
  <li>Their pangs of love, with other incident throes</li>
  <li>That nature’s fragile vessel doth sustain</li>
  <li class="number">In life’s uncertain voyage, I will some kindness do them:</li>
  <li>I’ll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades’ wrath.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Senator">
  <li>I like this well; he will return again.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>I have a tree, which grows here in my close,</li>
  <li>That mine own use invites me to cut down,</li>
  <li class="number">And shortly must I fell it: tell my friends,</li>
  <li>Tell Athens, in the sequence of degree</li>
  <li>From high to low throughout, that whoso please</li>
  <li>To stop affliction, let him take his haste,</li>
  <li>Come hither, ere my tree hath felt the axe,</li>
  <li class="number">And hang himself. I pray you, do my greeting.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLAVIUS">
  <li>Trouble him no further; thus you still shall find him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TIMON">
  <li>Come not to me again: but say to Athens,</li>
  <li>Timon hath made his everlasting mansion</li>
  <li>Upon the beached verge of the salt flood;</li>
  <li class="number">Who once a day with his embossed froth</li>
  <li>The turbulent surge shall cover: thither come,</li>
  <li>And let my grave-stone be your oracle.</li>
  <li>Lips, let sour words go by and language end:</li>
  <li>What is amiss plague and infection mend!</li>
  <li class="number">Graves only be men’s works and death their gain!</li>
  <li>Sun, hide thy beams! Timon hath done his reign.</li>

  <li>Sound to this coward and lascivious town</li>
  <li>Our terrible approach.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">A parley sounded</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter Senators on the walls</li>
  <li>Till now you have gone on and fill’d the time</li>
  <li>With all licentious measure, making your wills</li>
  <li class="number">The scope of justice; till now myself and such</li>
  <li>As slept within the shadow of your power</li>
  <li>Have wander’d with our traversed arms and breathed</li>
  <li>Our sufferance vainly: now the time is flush,</li>
  <li>When crouching marrow in the bearer strong</li>
  <li class="number">Cries of itself ’No more:’ now breathless wrong</li>
  <li>Shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease,</li>
  <li>And pursy insolence shall break his wind</li>
  <li>With fear and horrid flight.</li>

<ol data-speaker="First Senator">
  <li>Noble and young,</li>
  <li class="number">When thy first griefs were but a mere conceit,</li>
  <li>Ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear,</li>

<ol data-speaker="Second Senator">
  <li class="number">So did we woo</li>

<ol data-speaker="First Senator">
  <li class="number">These walls of ours</li>

  <li>By decimation, and a tithed death — </li>
  <li>If thy revenges hunger for that food</li>

  <li>And by the hazard of the spotted die</li>
  <li class="number">Let die the spotted.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Senator">
  <li>All have not offended;</li>
  <li>For those that were, it is not square to take</li>

  <li>Which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall</li>
