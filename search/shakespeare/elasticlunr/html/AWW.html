<h3>SCENE I.  Rousillon. The COUNT’s palace.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS of Rousillon, HELENA,
and LAFEU, all in black</div>

<ol data-speaker="COUNTESS">
  <li>In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BERTRAM">
  <li>And I in going, madam, weep o’er my father’s death</li>
  <li>anew: but I must attend his majesty’s command, to</li>
  <li>whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAFEU">
  <li class="number">You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you,</li>
  <li>sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times</li>
  <li>good must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose</li>
  <li>worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather</li>
  <li>than lack it where there is such abundance.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COUNTESS">
  <li class="number">What hope is there of his majesty’s amendment?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAFEU">
  <li>He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose</li>
  <li>practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and</li>
  <li>finds no other advantage in the process but only the</li>
  <li>losing of hope by time.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COUNTESS">
  <li class="number">This young gentlewoman had a father — O, that</li>
  <li>’had’! how sad a passage ’tis! — whose skill was</li>
  <li>almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so</li>
  <li>far, would have made nature immortal, and death</li>
  <li>should have play for lack of work. Would, for the</li>
  <li class="number">king’s sake, he were living! I think it would be</li>
  <li>the death of the king’s disease.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAFEU">
  <li>How called you the man you speak of, madam?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COUNTESS">
  <li>He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was</li>
  <li>his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAFEU">
  <li class="number">He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very</li>
  <li>lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he</li>
  <li>was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge</li>
  <li>could be set up against mortality.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BERTRAM">
  <li>What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAFEU">
  <li class="number">A fistula, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BERTRAM">
  <li>I heard not of it before.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAFEU">
  <li>I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman</li>
  <li>the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COUNTESS">
  <li>His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my</li>
  <li class="number">overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that</li>
  <li>her education promises; her dispositions she</li>
  <li>inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where</li>
  <li>an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there</li>
  <li>commendations go with pity; they are virtues and</li>
  <li class="number">traitors too; in her they are the better for their</li>
  <li>simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAFEU">
  <li>Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COUNTESS">
  <li>’Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise</li>
  <li>in. The remembrance of her father never approaches</li>
  <li class="number">her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all</li>
  <li>livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena;</li>
  <li>go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect</li>
  <li>a sorrow than have it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAFEU">
  <li class="number">Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,</li>
  <li>excessive grief the enemy to the living.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COUNTESS">
  <li>If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess</li>
  <li>makes it soon mortal.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BERTRAM">
  <li>Madam, I desire your holy wishes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAFEU">
  <li class="number">How understand we that?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COUNTESS">
  <li>Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father</li>
  <li>In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue</li>
  <li>Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness</li>
  <li>Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,</li>
  <li class="number">Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy</li>
  <li>Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend</li>
  <li>Under thy own life’s key: be cheque’d for silence,</li>
  <li>But never tax’d for speech. What heaven more will,</li>
  <li>That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,</li>
  <li class="number">Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord;</li>
  <li>’Tis an unseason’d courtier; good my lord,</li>
  <li>Advise him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAFEU">
  <li>He cannot want the best</li>
  <li>That shall attend his love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COUNTESS">
  <li class="number">Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<ol data-speaker="BERTRAM">
  <li><stagedir>To HELENA</stagedir>  The best wishes that can be forged in</li>
  <li>your thoughts be servants to you! Be comfortable</li>
  <li>to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LAFEU">
  <li>Farewell, pretty lady: you must hold the credit of</li>
  <li class="number">your father.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU</div>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>O, were that all! I think not on my father;</li>
  <li>And these great tears grace his remembrance more</li>
  <li>Than those I shed for him. What was he like?</li>
  <li>I have forgot him: my imagination</li>
  <li class="number">Carries no favour in’t but Bertram’s.</li>
  <li>I am undone: there is no living, none,</li>
  <li>If Bertram be away. ’Twere all one</li>
  <li>That I should love a bright particular star</li>
  <li>And think to wed it, he is so above me:</li>
  <li class="number">In his bright radiance and collateral light</li>
  <li>Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.</li>
  <li>The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:</li>
  <li>The hind that would be mated by the lion</li>
  <li>Must die for love. ’Twas pretty, though plague,</li>
  <li class="number">To see him every hour; to sit and draw</li>
  <li>His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,</li>
  <li>In our heart’s table; heart too capable</li>
  <li>Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:</li>
  <li>But now he’s gone, and my idolatrous fancy</li>
  <li class="number">Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter PAROLLES</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Aside</li>
  <li>One that goes with him: I love him for his sake;</li>
  <li>And yet I know him a notorious liar,</li>
  <li>Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;</li>
  <li>Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,</li>
  <li class="number">That they take place, when virtue’s steely bones</li>
  <li>Look bleak i’ the cold wind: withal, full oft we see</li>
  <li>Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAROLLES">
  <li>Save you, fair queen!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>And you, monarch!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAROLLES">
  <li class="number">No.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>And no.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAROLLES">
  <li>Are you meditating on virginity?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me</li>
  <li>ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how</li>
  <li class="number">may we barricado it against him?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAROLLES">
  <li>Keep him out.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant,</li>
  <li>in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some</li>
  <li>warlike resistance.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAROLLES">
  <li class="number">There is none: man, sitting down before you, will</li>
  <li>undermine you and blow you up.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>Bless our poor virginity from underminers and</li>
  <li>blowers up! Is there no military policy, how</li>
  <li>virgins might blow up men?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAROLLES">
  <li class="number">Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be</li>
  <li>blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with</li>
  <li>the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It</li>
  <li>is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to</li>
  <li>preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational</li>
  <li class="number">increase and there was never virgin got till</li>
  <li>virginity was first lost. That you were made of is</li>
  <li>metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost</li>
  <li>may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is</li>
  <li>ever lost: ’tis too cold a companion; away with ’t!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li class="number">I will stand for ’t a little, though therefore I die a virgin.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAROLLES">
  <li>There’s little can be said in ’t; ’tis against the</li>
  <li>rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,</li>
  <li>is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible</li>
  <li>disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:</li>
  <li class="number">virginity murders itself and should be buried in</li>
  <li>highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate</li>
  <li>offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,</li>
  <li>much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very</li>
  <li>paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.</li>
  <li class="number">Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of</li>
  <li>self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the</li>
  <li>canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose</li>
  <li>by’t: out with ’t! within ten year it will make</li>
  <li>itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the</li>
  <li class="number">principal itself not much the worse: away with ’t!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAROLLES">
  <li>Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne’er it</li>
  <li>likes. ’Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with</li>
  <li>lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with ’t</li>
  <li class="number">while ’tis vendible; answer the time of request.</li>
  <li>Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out</li>
  <li>of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just</li>
  <li>like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not</li>
  <li>now. Your date is better in your pie and your</li>
  <li class="number">porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity,</li>
  <li>your old virginity, is like one of our French</li>
  <li>withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry,</li>
  <li>’tis a withered pear; it was formerly better;</li>
  <li>marry, yet ’tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li class="number">Not my virginity yet</li>
  <li>There shall your master have a thousand loves,</li>
  <li>A mother and a mistress and a friend,</li>
  <li>A phoenix, captain and an enemy,</li>
  <li>A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,</li>
  <li class="number">A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;</li>
  <li>His humble ambition, proud humility,</li>
  <li>His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,</li>
  <li>His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world</li>
  <li>Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,</li>
  <li class="number">That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he — </li>
  <li>I know not what he shall. God send him well!</li>
  <li>The court’s a learning place, and he is one — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAROLLES">
  <li>What one, i’ faith?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>That I wish well. ’Tis pity — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAROLLES">
  <li class="number">What’s pity?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>That wishing well had not a body in’t,</li>
  <li>Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,</li>
  <li>Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,</li>
  <li>Might with effects of them follow our friends,</li>
  <li class="number">And show what we alone must think, which never</li>
  <li>Return us thanks.</li>

  <li>Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.</li>

<ol data-speaker="PAROLLES">
  <li>Little Helen, farewell; if I can remember thee, I</li>
  <li>will think of thee at court.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li class="number">Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAROLLES">
  <li>Under Mars, I.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>I especially think, under Mars.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAROLLES">
  <li>Why under Mars?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>The wars have so kept you under that you must needs</li>
  <li class="number">be born under Mars.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAROLLES">
  <li>When he was predominant.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>When he was retrograde, I think, rather.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAROLLES">
  <li>Why think you so?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>You go so much backward when you fight.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAROLLES">
  <li class="number">That’s for advantage.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>So is running away, when fear proposes the safety;</li>
  <li>but the composition that your valour and fear makes</li>
  <li>in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAROLLES">
  <li>I am so full of businesses, I cannot answer thee</li>
  <li class="number">acutely. I will return perfect courtier; in the</li>
  <li>which, my instruction shall serve to naturalize</li>
  <li>thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier’s</li>
  <li>counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon</li>
  <li>thee; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and</li>
  <li class="number">thine ignorance makes thee away: farewell. When</li>
  <li>thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast</li>
  <li>none, remember thy friends; get thee a good husband,</li>
  <li>and use him as he uses thee; so, farewell.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,</li>
  <li class="number">Which we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky</li>
  <li>Gives us free scope, only doth backward pull</li>
  <li>Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.</li>
  <li>What power is it which mounts my love so high,</li>
  <li>That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?</li>
  <li class="number">The mightiest space in fortune nature brings</li>
  <li>To join like likes and kiss like native things.</li>
  <li>Impossible be strange attempts to those</li>
  <li>That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose</li>
  <li>What hath been cannot be: who ever strove</li>
  <li class="number">So show her merit, that did miss her love?</li>

  <li class="number">Youth, thou bear’st thy father’s face;</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING">
  <li class="number">I would I had that corporal soundness now,</li>
  <li>As when thy father and myself in friendship</li>
  <li>First tried our soldiership! He did look far</li>
  <li>Into the service of the time and was</li>
  <li>Discipled of the bravest: he lasted long;</li>
  <li class="number">But on us both did haggish age steal on</li>
  <li>And wore us out of act. It much repairs me</li>
  <li>To talk of your good father. In his youth</li>
  <li>He had the wit which I can well observe</li>
  <li>To-day in our young lords; but they may jest</li>
  <li class="number">Till their own scorn return to them unnoted</li>
  <li>Ere they can hide their levity in honour;</li>
  <li>So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness</li>
  <li>Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,</li>
  <li>His equal had awaked them, and his honour,</li>
  <li class="number">Clock to itself, knew the true minute when</li>
  <li>Exception bid him speak, and at this time</li>
  <li>His tongue obey’d his hand: who were below him</li>
  <li>He used as creatures of another place</li>
  <li>And bow’d his eminent top to their low ranks,</li>
  <li class="number">Making them proud of his humility,</li>
  <li>In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man</li>
  <li>Might be a copy to these younger times;</li>

  <li>Would I were with him! He would always say — </li>
  <li class="number">Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words</li>
  <li>He scatter’d not in ears, but grafted them,</li>
  <li>To grow there and to bear — ’Let me not live,’ — </li>
  <li>This his good melancholy oft began,</li>
  <li>On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,</li>
  <li class="number">When it was out — ’Let me not live,’ quoth he,</li>

  <li>What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah:</li>

  <li>My poor body, madam, requires it: I am driven on</li>
  <li>by the flesh; and he must needs go that the devil drives.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COUNTESS">
  <li>Is this all your worship’s reason?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Clown">
  <li>Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons such as they</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COUNTESS">
  <li>May the world know them?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Clown">
  <li>I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and</li>
  <li>all flesh and blood are; and, indeed, I do marry</li>
  <li>that I may repent.</li>

<ol data-speaker="COUNTESS">
  <li class="number">Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.</li>

<ol data-speaker="Clown">
  <li>I am out o’ friends, madam; and I hope to have</li>
  <li>friends for my wife’s sake.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COUNTESS">
  <li>Such friends are thine enemies, knave.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Clown">
  <li>You’re shallow, madam, in great friends; for the</li>
  <li class="number">knaves come to do that for me which I am aweary of.</li>
  <li>He that ears my land spares my team and gives me</li>
  <li>leave to in the crop; if I be his cuckold, he’s my</li>
  <li>drudge: he that comforts my wife is the cherisher</li>
  <li>of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh</li>
  <li class="number">and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my</li>
  <li>flesh and blood is my friend: ergo, he that kisses</li>
  <li>my wife is my friend. If men could be contented to</li>
  <li>be what they are, there were no fear in marriage;</li>
  <li>for young Charbon the Puritan and old Poysam the</li>
  <li class="number">Papist, howsome’er their hearts are severed in</li>

  <li>Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouthed and calumnious knave?</li>

  <li>Your marriage comes by destiny,</li>

  <li class="number">Was this fair face the cause, quoth she,</li>
  <li>Why the Grecians sacked Troy?</li>
  <li>Fond done, done fond,</li>
  <li>Was this King Priam’s joy?</li>
  <li>With that she sighed as she stood,</li>
  <li class="number">With that she sighed as she stood,</li>

  <li>Among nine bad if one be good,</li>
  <li>Among nine bad if one be good,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COUNTESS">
  <li class="number">What, one good in ten? you corrupt the song, sirrah.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Clown">
  <li>One good woman in ten, madam; which is a purifying</li>
  <li>o’ the song: would God would serve the world so all</li>
  <li>the year! we’ld find no fault with the tithe-woman,</li>
  <li>if I were the parson. One in ten, quoth a’! An we</li>
  <li class="number">might have a good woman born but one every blazing</li>
  <li>star, or at an earthquake, ’twould mend the lottery</li>
  <li>well: a man may draw his heart out, ere a’ pluck</li>
  <li>one.</li>
</ol>

  <li>You’ll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Clown">
  <li class="number">That man should be at woman’s command, and yet no</li>

  <li>I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.</li>

  <li>Faith, I do: her father bequeathed her to me; and</li>

  <li>her than she’ll demand.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Steward">
  <li>Madam, I was very late more near her than I think</li>
  <li>she wished me: alone she was, and did communicate</li>
  <li>to herself her own words to her own ears; she</li>
  <li class="number">thought, I dare vow for her, they touched not any</li>
  <li>stranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your son:</li>
  <li>Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put</li>
  <li>such difference betwixt their two estates; Love no</li>
  <li>god, that would not extend his might, only where</li>
  <li class="number">qualities were level; Dian no queen of virgins, that</li>
  <li>would suffer her poor knight surprised, without</li>
  <li>rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward.</li>
  <li>This she delivered in the most bitter touch of</li>
  <li>sorrow that e’er I heard virgin exclaim in: which I</li>
  <li class="number">held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal;</li>
  <li>sithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns</li>
  <li>you something to know it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COUNTESS">
  <li>You have discharged this honestly; keep it to</li>
  <li>yourself: many likelihoods informed me of this</li>
  <li class="number">before, which hung so tottering in the balance that</li>
  <li>I could neither believe nor misdoubt. Pray you,</li>

  <li class="stage-direction">Enter HELENA</li>
  <li>Even so it was with me when I was young:</li>
  <li class="number">If ever we are nature’s, these are ours; this thorn</li>
  <li>Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong;</li>
  <li>Our blood to us, this to our blood is born;</li>
  <li>It is the show and seal of nature’s truth,</li>
  <li>Where love’s strong passion is impress’d in youth:</li>
  <li class="number">By our remembrances of days foregone,</li>
  <li>Such were our faults, or then we thought them none.</li>
  <li>Her eye is sick on’t: I observe her now.</li>

<ol data-speaker="COUNTESS">
  <li>You know, Helen,</li>

<ol data-speaker="COUNTESS">
  <li>Nay, a mother:</li>
  <li>Why not a mother? When I said ’a mother,’</li>

  <li class="number">That you start at it? I say, I am your mother;</li>
  <li>And put you in the catalogue of those</li>
  <li>That were enwombed mine: ’tis often seen</li>
  <li>Adoption strives with nature and choice breeds</li>
  <li>A native slip to us from foreign seeds:</li>
  <li class="number">You ne’er oppress’d me with a mother’s groan,</li>
  <li>Yet I express to you a mother’s care:</li>
  <li>God’s mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood</li>
  <li>To say I am thy mother? What’s the matter,</li>
  <li>That this distemper’d messenger of wet,</li>
  <li class="number">The many-colour’d Iris, rounds thine eye?</li>
  <li>Why? that you are my daughter?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>That I am not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COUNTESS">
  <li>I say, I am your mother.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>Pardon, madam;</li>
  <li class="number">The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother:</li>
  <li>I am from humble, he from honour’d name;</li>
  <li>No note upon my parents, his all noble:</li>
  <li>My master, my dear lord he is; and I</li>
  <li>His servant live, and will his vassal die:</li>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>You are my mother, madam; would you were — </li>

  <li>Indeed my mother! or were you both our mothers,</li>
  <li class="number">I care no more for than I do for heaven,</li>
  <li>So I were not his sister. Can’t no other,</li>
  <li>But, I your daughter, he must be my brother?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COUNTESS">
  <li>Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law:</li>
  <li>God shield you mean it not! daughter and mother</li>
  <li class="number">So strive upon your pulse. What, pale again?</li>
  <li>My fear hath catch’d your fondness: now I see</li>
  <li>The mystery of your loneliness, and find</li>
  <li>Your salt tears’ head: now to all sense ’tis gross</li>
  <li>You love my son; invention is ashamed,</li>
  <li class="number">Against the proclamation of thy passion,</li>
  <li>To say thou dost not: therefore tell me true;</li>
  <li>But tell me then, ’tis so; for, look thy cheeks</li>
  <li>Confess it, th’ one to th’ other; and thine eyes</li>
  <li>See it so grossly shown in thy behaviors</li>
  <li class="number">That in their kind they speak it: only sin</li>
  <li>And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,</li>
  <li>That truth should be suspected. Speak, is’t so?</li>
  <li>If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;</li>
  <li>If it be not, forswear’t: howe’er, I charge thee,</li>
  <li class="number">As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,</li>
  <li>Tell me truly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>Good madam, pardon me!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COUNTESS">
  <li>Do you love my son?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>Your pardon, noble mistress!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COUNTESS">
  <li class="number">Love you my son?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>Do not you love him, madam?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COUNTESS">
  <li>Go not about; my love hath in’t a bond,</li>
  <li>Whereof the world takes note: come, come, disclose</li>
  <li>The state of your affection; for your passions</li>
  <li class="number">Have to the full appeach’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>Then, I confess,</li>
  <li>Here on my knee, before high heaven and you,</li>
  <li>That before you, and next unto high heaven,</li>
  <li>I love your son.</li>
  <li class="number">My friends were poor, but honest; so’s my love:</li>
  <li>Be not offended; for it hurts not him</li>
  <li>That he is loved of me: I follow him not</li>
  <li>By any token of presumptuous suit;</li>
  <li>Nor would I have him till I do deserve him;</li>
  <li class="number">Yet never know how that desert should be.</li>
  <li>I know I love in vain, strive against hope;</li>
  <li>Yet in this captious and intenible sieve</li>
  <li>I still pour in the waters of my love</li>
  <li>And lack not to lose still: thus, Indian-like,</li>
  <li class="number">Religious in mine error, I adore</li>
  <li>The sun, that looks upon his worshipper,</li>
  <li>But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,</li>
  <li>Let not your hate encounter with my love</li>
  <li>For loving where you do: but if yourself,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,</li>
  <li>Did ever in so true a flame of liking</li>
  <li>Wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian</li>
  <li>Was both herself and love: O, then, give pity</li>
  <li>To her, whose state is such that cannot choose</li>
  <li class="number">But lend and give where she is sure to lose;</li>
  <li>That seeks not to find that her search implies,</li>
  <li>But riddle-like lives sweetly where she dies!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COUNTESS">
  <li>Had you not lately an intent — speak truly — </li>
  <li>To go to Paris?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li class="number">Madam, I had.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COUNTESS">
  <li>Wherefore? tell true.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>I will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.</li>
  <li>You know my father left me some prescriptions</li>
  <li>Of rare and proved effects, such as his reading</li>
  <li class="number">And manifest experience had collected</li>
  <li>For general sovereignty; and that he will’d me</li>
  <li>In heedfull’st reservation to bestow them,</li>
  <li>As notes whose faculties inclusive were</li>
  <li>More than they were in note: amongst the rest,</li>
  <li class="number">There is a remedy, approved, set down,</li>
  <li>To cure the desperate languishings whereof</li>
  <li>The king is render’d lost.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COUNTESS">
  <li>This was your motive</li>
  <li>For Paris, was it? speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li class="number">My lord your son made me to think of this;</li>
  <li>Else Paris and the medicine and the king</li>
  <li>Had from the conversation of my thoughts</li>
  <li>Haply been absent then.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COUNTESS">
  <li>But think you, Helen,</li>
  <li class="number">If you should tender your supposed aid,</li>
  <li>He would receive it? he and his physicians</li>
  <li>Are of a mind; he, that they cannot help him,</li>
  <li>They, that they cannot help: how shall they credit</li>
  <li>A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,</li>
  <li class="number">Embowell’d of their doctrine, have left off</li>
  <li>The danger to itself?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>There’s something in’t,</li>
  <li>More than my father’s skill, which was the greatest</li>
  <li>Of his profession, that his good receipt</li>
  <li class="number">Shall for my legacy be sanctified</li>
  <li>By the luckiest stars in heaven: and, would your honour</li>
  <li>But give me leave to try success, I’ld venture</li>
  <li>The well-lost life of mine on his grace’s cure</li>
  <li>By such a day and hour.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COUNTESS">
  <li class="number">Dost thou believe’t?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>Ay, madam, knowingly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COUNTESS">
  <li>Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,</li>
  <li>Means and attendants and my loving greetings</li>
  <li>To those of mine in court: I’ll stay at home</li>
  <li class="number">And pray God’s blessing into thy attempt:</li>
  <li>Be gone to-morrow; and be sure of this,</li>
  <li>What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss.</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING">
  <li>Farewell, young lords; these warlike principles</li>

  <li>Those bated that inherit but the fall</li>
  <li class="number">Of the last monarchy — see that you come</li>
  <li>Not to woo honour, but to wed it; when</li>

  <li>O, will you eat no grapes, my royal fox?</li>
  <li>Yes, but you will my noble grapes, an if</li>

  <li>Now, fair one, does your business follow us?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>Ay, my good lord.</li>
  <li>Gerard de Narbon was my father;</li>
  <li>In what he did profess, well found.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING">
  <li class="number">I knew him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>The rather will I spare my praises towards him:</li>
  <li>Knowing him is enough. On’s bed of death</li>
  <li>Many receipts he gave me: chiefly one.</li>
  <li>Which, as the dearest issue of his practise,</li>
  <li class="number">And of his old experience the oily darling,</li>
  <li>He bade me store up, as a triple eye,</li>
  <li>Safer than mine own two, more dear; I have so;</li>
  <li>And hearing your high majesty is touch’d</li>
  <li>With that malignant cause wherein the honour</li>
  <li class="number">Of my dear father’s gift stands chief in power,</li>
  <li>I come to tender it and my appliance</li>
  <li>With all bound humbleness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING">
  <li>We thank you, maiden;</li>
  <li>But may not be so credulous of cure,</li>
  <li class="number">When our most learned doctors leave us and</li>
  <li>The congregated college have concluded</li>
  <li>That labouring art can never ransom nature</li>
  <li>From her inaidible estate; I say we must not</li>
  <li>So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,</li>
  <li class="number">To prostitute our past-cure malady</li>
  <li>To empirics, or to dissever so</li>
  <li>Our great self and our credit, to esteem</li>
  <li>A senseless help when help past sense we deem.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>My duty then shall pay me for my pains:</li>
  <li class="number">I will no more enforce mine office on you.</li>
  <li>Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts</li>
  <li>A modest one, to bear me back a again.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING">
  <li>I cannot give thee less, to be call’d grateful:</li>
  <li>Thou thought’st to help me; and such thanks I give</li>
  <li class="number">As one near death to those that wish him live:</li>
  <li>But what at full I know, thou know’st no part,</li>
  <li>I knowing all my peril, thou no art.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>What I can do can do no hurt to try,</li>
  <li>Since you set up your rest ’gainst remedy.</li>
  <li class="number">He that of greatest works is finisher</li>
  <li>Oft does them by the weakest minister:</li>
  <li>So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,</li>
  <li>When judges have been babes; great floods have flown</li>
  <li>From simple sources, and great seas have dried</li>
  <li class="number">When miracles have by the greatest been denied.</li>
  <li>Oft expectation fails and most oft there</li>
  <li>Where most it promises, and oft it hits</li>
  <li>Where hope is coldest and despair most fits.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING">
  <li>I must not hear thee; fare thee well, kind maid;</li>
  <li class="number">Thy pains not used must by thyself be paid:</li>
  <li>Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>Inspired merit so by breath is barr’d:</li>
  <li>It is not so with Him that all things knows</li>
  <li>As ’tis with us that square our guess by shows;</li>
  <li class="number">But most it is presumption in us when</li>
  <li>The help of heaven we count the act of men.</li>
  <li>Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent;</li>
  <li>Of heaven, not me, make an experiment.</li>
  <li>I am not an impostor that proclaim</li>
  <li class="number">Myself against the level of mine aim;</li>
  <li>But know I think and think I know most sure</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING">
  <li>Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak</li>
  <li>His powerful sound within an organ weak:</li>

  <li>In common sense, sense saves another way.</li>
  <li class="number">Thy life is dear; for all that life can rate</li>
  <li>Worth name of life in thee hath estimate,</li>

  <li>Thou this to hazard needs must intimate</li>
  <li class="number">Skill infinite or monstrous desperate.</li>
  <li>Sweet practiser, thy physic I will try,</li>
  <li>That ministers thine own death if I die.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>If I break time, or flinch in property</li>
  <li>Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die,</li>
  <li class="number">And well deserved: not helping, death’s my fee;</li>
  <li>But, if I help, what do you promise me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING">
  <li>Make thy demand.</li>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>But will you make it even?</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING">
  <li>Ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li class="number">Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand</li>
  <li>What husband in thy power I will command:</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COUNTESS">
  <li class="number">To the court! why, what place make you special,</li>
  <li>when you put off that with such contempt? But to the court!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Clown">
  <li>Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he</li>
  <li>may easily put it off at court: he that cannot make</li>
  <li>a leg, put off’s cap, kiss his hand and say nothing,</li>
  <li class="number">has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap; and indeed</li>
  <li>such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for the</li>

  <li>men.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COUNTESS">
  <li>Marry, that’s a bountiful answer that fits all</li>
  <li class="number">questions.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Clown">
  <li>It is like a barber’s chair that fits all buttocks,</li>
  <li>the pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawn</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COUNTESS">
  <li>Will your answer serve fit to all questions?</li>

<ol data-speaker="Clown">
  <li class="number">As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney,</li>
  <li>as your French crown for your taffeta punk, as Tib’s</li>

  <li>Tuesday, a morris for May-day, as the nail to his</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COUNTESS">
  <li>Have you, I say, an answer of such fitness for all</li>
  <li>questions?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Clown">
  <li>From below your duke to beneath your constable, it</li>
  <li class="number">will fit any question.</li>

  <li>It must be an answer of most monstrous size that</li>

  <li>But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned</li>

  <li>O Lord, sir! spare not me.</li>

  <li>Do you cry, ’O Lord, sir!’ at your whipping, and</li>
  <li>’spare not me?’ Indeed your ’O Lord, sir!’ is very</li>

  <li>to a whipping, if you were but bound to’t.</li>

  <li>The place is dignified by the doer’s deed:</li>
  <li>Where great additions swell’s, and virtue none,</li>
  <li>It is a dropsied honour. Good alone</li>
  <li class="number">Is good without a name. Vileness is so:</li>
  <li>The property by what it is should go,</li>
  <li>Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;</li>
  <li>In these to nature she’s immediate heir,</li>

  <li>You’re welcome, gentlemen.</li>

<h3>SCENE VI.  Camp before Florence.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter BERTRAM and the two French Lords</div>

<ol data-speaker="Second Lord">
  <li>Nay, good my lord, put him to’t; let him have his</li>
  <li>way.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Lord">
  <li>If your lordship find him not a hilding, hold me no</li>
  <li>more in your respect.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Lord">
  <li class="number">On my life, my lord, a bubble.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BERTRAM">
  <li>Do you think I am so far deceived in him?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Lord">
  <li>Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge,</li>
  <li>without any malice, but to speak of him as my</li>
  <li>kinsman, he’s a most notable coward, an infinite and</li>
  <li class="number">endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the owner</li>
  <li>of no one good quality worthy your lordship’s</li>
  <li>entertainment.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Lord">
  <li>It were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in</li>
  <li>his virtue, which he hath not, he might at some</li>
  <li class="number">great and trusty business in a main danger fail you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BERTRAM">
  <li>I would I knew in what particular action to try him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Lord">
  <li>None better than to let him fetch off his drum,</li>
  <li>which you hear him so confidently undertake to do.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Lord">
  <li>I, with a troop of Florentines, will suddenly</li>
  <li class="number">surprise him; such I will have, whom I am sure he</li>
  <li>knows not from the enemy: we will bind and hoodwink</li>
  <li>him so, that he shall suppose no other but that he</li>
  <li>is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries, when</li>
  <li>we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship</li>
  <li class="number">present at his examination: if he do not, for the</li>
  <li>promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of</li>
  <li>base fear, offer to betray you and deliver all the</li>
  <li>intelligence in his power against you, and that with</li>
  <li>the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never</li>
  <li class="number">trust my judgment in any thing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Lord">
  <li>O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum;</li>
  <li>he says he has a stratagem for’t: when your</li>
  <li>lordship sees the bottom of his success in’t, and to</li>
  <li>what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be</li>
  <li class="number">melted, if you give him not John Drum’s</li>
  <li>entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed.</li>
  <li>Here he comes.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter PAROLLES</div>

<ol data-speaker="Second Lord">
  <li><stagedir>Aside to BERTRAM</stagedir>  O, for the love of laughter,</li>
  <li>hinder not the honour of his design: let him fetch</li>
  <li class="number">off his drum in any hand.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BERTRAM">
  <li>How now, monsieur! this drum sticks sorely in your</li>
  <li>disposition.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Lord">
  <li>A pox on’t, let it go; ’tis but a drum.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAROLLES">
  <li>’But a drum’! is’t ’but a drum’? A drum so lost!</li>
  <li class="number">There was excellent command — to charge in with our</li>
  <li>horse upon our own wings, and to rend our own soldiers!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Lord">
  <li>That was not to be blamed in the command of the</li>
  <li>service: it was a disaster of war that Caesar</li>
  <li>himself could not have prevented, if he had been</li>
  <li class="number">there to command.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BERTRAM">
  <li>Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some</li>
  <li>dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is</li>
  <li>not to be recovered.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAROLLES">
  <li>It might have been recovered.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BERTRAM">
  <li class="number">It might; but it is not now.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAROLLES">
  <li>It is to be recovered: but that the merit of</li>
  <li>service is seldom attributed to the true and exact</li>
  <li>performer, I would have that drum or another, or</li>
  <li>’hic jacet.’</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BERTRAM">
  <li class="number">Why, if you have a stomach, to’t, monsieur: if you</li>
  <li>think your mystery in stratagem can bring this</li>
  <li>instrument of honour again into his native quarter,</li>
  <li>be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on; I will</li>
  <li>grace the attempt for a worthy exploit: if you</li>
  <li class="number">speed well in it, the duke shall both speak of it.</li>
  <li>and extend to you what further becomes his</li>
  <li>greatness, even to the utmost syllable of your</li>
  <li>worthiness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAROLLES">
  <li>By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BERTRAM">
  <li class="number">But you must not now slumber in it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAROLLES">
  <li>I’ll about it this evening: and I will presently</li>
  <li>pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my</li>
  <li>certainty, put myself into my mortal preparation;</li>
  <li>and by midnight look to hear further from me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BERTRAM">
  <li class="number">May I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAROLLES">
  <li>I know not what the success will be, my lord; but</li>
  <li>the attempt I vow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BERTRAM">
  <li>I know thou’rt valiant; and, to the possibility of</li>
  <li>thy soldiership, will subscribe for thee. Farewell.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAROLLES">
  <li class="number">I love not many words.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<ol data-speaker="Second Lord">
  <li>No more than a fish loves water. Is not this a</li>
  <li>strange fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems</li>
  <li>to undertake this business, which he knows is not to</li>
  <li>be done; damns himself to do and dares better be</li>
  <li class="number">damned than to do’t?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Lord">
  <li>You do not know him, my lord, as we do: certain it</li>
  <li>is that he will steal himself into a man’s favour and</li>
  <li>for a week escape a great deal of discoveries; but</li>
  <li>when you find him out, you have him ever after.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BERTRAM">
  <li class="number">Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of</li>
  <li>this that so seriously he does address himself unto?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Lord">
  <li>None in the world; but return with an invention and</li>
  <li>clap upon you two or three probable lies: but we</li>
  <li>have almost embossed him; you shall see his fall</li>
  <li class="number">to-night; for indeed he is not for your lordship’s respect.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Lord">
  <li>We’ll make you some sport with the fox ere we case</li>
  <li>him. He was first smoked by the old lord Lafeu:</li>
  <li>when his disguise and he is parted, tell me what a</li>

  <li class="number">very night.</li>

  <li>I must go look my twigs: he shall be caught.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BERTRAM">
  <li>Your brother he shall go along with me.</li>

<ol data-speaker="First Lord">
  <li>But you say she’s honest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BERTRAM">
  <li>That’s all the fault: I spoke with her but once</li>
  <li>And found her wondrous cold; but I sent to her,</li>
  <li>By this same coxcomb that we have i’ the wind,</li>

<h3>SCENE III.  The Florentine camp.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter the two French Lords and some two or three Soldiers</div>

<ol data-speaker="First Lord">
  <li>You have not given him his mother’s letter?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Lord">
  <li>I have delivered it an hour since: there is</li>
  <li>something in’t that stings his nature; for on the</li>
  <li>reading it he changed almost into another man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Lord">
  <li class="number">He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking</li>
  <li>off so good a wife and so sweet a lady.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Lord">
  <li>Especially he hath incurred the everlasting</li>
  <li>displeasure of the king, who had even tuned his</li>
  <li>bounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you a</li>
  <li class="number">thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Lord">
  <li>When you have spoken it, ’tis dead, and I am the</li>
  <li>grave of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Lord">
  <li>He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in</li>
  <li>Florence, of a most chaste renown; and this night he</li>
  <li class="number">fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour: he hath</li>
  <li>given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself</li>
  <li>made in the unchaste composition.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Lord">
  <li>Now, God delay our rebellion! as we are ourselves,</li>
  <li>what things are we!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Lord">
  <li class="number">Merely our own traitors. And as in the common course</li>
  <li>of all treasons, we still see them reveal</li>
  <li>themselves, till they attain to their abhorred ends,</li>
  <li>so he that in this action contrives against his own</li>
  <li>nobility, in his proper stream o’erflows himself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Lord">
  <li class="number">Is it not meant damnable in us, to be trumpeters of</li>
  <li>our unlawful intents? We shall not then have his</li>
  <li>company to-night?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Lord">
  <li>Not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Lord">
  <li>That approaches apace; I would gladly have him see</li>
  <li class="number">his company anatomized, that he might take a measure</li>
  <li>of his own judgments, wherein so curiously he had</li>
  <li>set this counterfeit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Lord">
  <li>We will not meddle with him till he come; for his</li>
  <li>presence must be the whip of the other.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Lord">
  <li class="number">In the mean time, what hear you of these wars?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Lord">
  <li>I hear there is an overture of peace.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Lord">
  <li>Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Lord">
  <li>What will Count Rousillon do then? will he travel</li>
  <li>higher, or return again into France?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Lord">
  <li class="number">I perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether</li>
  <li>of his council.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Lord">
  <li>Let it be forbid, sir; so should I be a great deal</li>
  <li>of his act.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Lord">
  <li>Sir, his wife some two months since fled from his</li>
  <li class="number">house: her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques</li>
  <li>le Grand; which holy undertaking with most austere</li>
  <li>sanctimony she accomplished; and, there residing the</li>
  <li>tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her</li>
  <li>grief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and</li>
  <li class="number">now she sings in heaven.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Lord">
  <li>How is this justified?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Lord">
  <li>The stronger part of it by her own letters, which</li>
  <li>makes her story true, even to the point of her</li>
  <li>death: her death itself, which could not be her</li>
  <li class="number">office to say is come, was faithfully confirmed by</li>
  <li>the rector of the place.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Lord">
  <li>Hath the count all this intelligence?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Lord">
  <li>Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from</li>
  <li>point, so to the full arming of the verity.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Lord">
  <li class="number">I am heartily sorry that he’ll be glad of this.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Lord">
  <li>How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Lord">
  <li>And how mightily some other times we drown our gain</li>
  <li>in tears! The great dignity that his valour hath</li>
  <li>here acquired for him shall at home be encountered</li>
  <li class="number">with a shame as ample.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Lord">
  <li>The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and</li>
  <li>ill together: our virtues would be proud, if our</li>
  <li>faults whipped them not; and our crimes would</li>
  <li>despair, if they were not cherished by our virtues.</li>

<ol data-speaker="Servant">
  <li>He met the duke in the street, sir, of whom he hath</li>

  <li>How now, my lord! is’t not after midnight?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BERTRAM">
  <li class="number">I have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses, a</li>
  <li>month’s length a-piece, by an abstract of success:</li>
  <li>I have congied with the duke, done my adieu with his</li>
  <li>nearest; buried a wife, mourned for her; writ to my</li>
  <li>lady mother I am returning; entertained my convoy;</li>
  <li class="number">and between these main parcels of dispatch effected</li>
  <li>many nicer needs; the last was the greatest, but</li>
  <li>that I have not ended yet.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Lord">
  <li>If the business be of any difficulty, and this</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BERTRAM">
  <li>I mean, the business is not ended, as fearing to</li>

  <li class="number">me, like a double-meaning prophesier.</li>

  <li>Bring him forth: has sat i’ the stocks all night,</li>

  <li>No matter: his heels have deserved it, in usurping</li>
  <li>his spurs so long. How does he carry himself?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Lord">
  <li class="number">I have told your lordship already, the stocks carry</li>
  <li>him. But to answer you as you would be understood;</li>
  <li>he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk: he</li>
  <li>hath confessed himself to Morgan, whom he supposes</li>
  <li>to be a friar, from the time of his remembrance to</li>
  <li class="number">this very instant disaster of his setting i’ the</li>
  <li>stocks: and what think you he hath confessed?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BERTRAM">
  <li>Nothing of me, has a’?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Lord">
  <li>His confession is taken, and it shall be read to his</li>

<ol data-speaker="PAROLLES">
  <li>By my troth, sir, if I were to live this present</li>

  <li>and Gratii, two hundred and fifty each; mine own</li>

<ol data-speaker="PAROLLES">
  <li>The duke knows him for no other but a poor officer</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAROLLES">
  <li class="number">My meaning in’t, I protest, was very honest in the</li>
