<h3>SCENE I.  KING JOHN’S palace.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter KING JOHN, QUEEN ELINOR, PEMBROKE, ESSEX,
SALISBURY, and others, with CHATILLON</div>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN">
  <li>Now, say, Chatillon, what would France with us?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CHATILLON">
  <li>Thus, after greeting, speaks the King of France</li>
  <li>In my behavior to the majesty,</li>
  <li>The borrow’d majesty, of England here.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN ELINOR">
  <li class="number">A strange beginning: ’borrow’d majesty!’</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN">
  <li>Silence, good mother; hear the embassy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CHATILLON">
  <li>Philip of France, in right and true behalf</li>
  <li>Of thy deceased brother Geffrey’s son,</li>
  <li>Arthur Plantagenet, lays most lawful claim</li>
  <li class="number">To this fair island and the territories,</li>
  <li>To Ireland, Poictiers, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,</li>
  <li>Desiring thee to lay aside the sword</li>
  <li>Which sways usurpingly these several titles,</li>
  <li>And put these same into young Arthur’s hand,</li>
  <li class="number">Thy nephew and right royal sovereign.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN">
  <li>What follows if we disallow of this?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CHATILLON">
  <li>The proud control of fierce and bloody war,</li>
  <li>To enforce these rights so forcibly withheld.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN">
  <li>Here have we war for war and blood for blood,</li>
  <li class="number">Controlment for controlment: so answer France.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CHATILLON">
  <li>Then take my king’s defiance from my mouth,</li>
  <li>The farthest limit of my embassy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN">
  <li>Bear mine to him, and so depart in peace:</li>
  <li>Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France;</li>
  <li class="number">For ere thou canst report I will be there,</li>
  <li>The thunder of my cannon shall be heard:</li>
  <li>So hence! Be thou the trumpet of our wrath</li>
  <li>And sullen presage of your own decay.</li>
  <li>An honourable conduct let him have:</li>
  <li class="number">Pembroke, look to ’t. Farewell, Chatillon.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt CHATILLON and PEMBROKE</div>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN ELINOR">
  <li>What now, my son! have I not ever said</li>
  <li>How that ambitious Constance would not cease</li>
  <li>Till she had kindled France and all the world,</li>
  <li>Upon the right and party of her son?</li>
  <li class="number">This might have been prevented and made whole</li>
  <li>With very easy arguments of love,</li>
  <li>Which now the manage of two kingdoms must</li>
  <li>With fearful bloody issue arbitrate.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN">
  <li>Our strong possession and our right for us.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN ELINOR">
  <li class="number">Your strong possession much more than your right,</li>
  <li>Or else it must go wrong with you and me:</li>
  <li>So much my conscience whispers in your ear,</li>
  <li>Which none but heaven and you and I shall hear.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter a Sheriff</div>

<ol data-speaker="ESSEX">
  <li>My liege, here is the strangest controversy</li>
  <li class="number">Come from country to be judged by you,</li>
  <li>That e’er I heard: shall I produce the men?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN">
  <li>Let them approach.</li>
  <li>Our abbeys and our priories shall pay</li>
  <li>This expedition’s charge.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter ROBERT and the BASTARD</li>
  <li class="number">What men are you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASTARD">
  <li>Your faithful subject I, a gentleman</li>
  <li>Born in Northamptonshire and eldest son,</li>
  <li>As I suppose, to Robert Faulconbridge,</li>
  <li>A soldier, by the honour-giving hand</li>
  <li class="number">Of Coeur-de-lion knighted in the field.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN">
  <li>What art thou?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROBERT">
  <li>The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN">
  <li>Is that the elder, and art thou the heir?</li>
  <li>You came not of one mother then, it seems.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASTARD">
  <li class="number">Most certain of one mother, mighty king;</li>
  <li>That is well known; and, as I think, one father:</li>
  <li>But for the certain knowledge of that truth</li>
  <li>I put you o’er to heaven and to my mother:</li>
  <li>Of that I doubt, as all men’s children may.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN ELINOR">
  <li class="number">Out on thee, rude man! thou dost shame thy mother</li>
  <li>And wound her honour with this diffidence.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASTARD">
  <li>I, madam? no, I have no reason for it;</li>
  <li>That is my brother’s plea and none of mine;</li>
  <li>The which if he can prove, a’ pops me out</li>
  <li class="number">At least from fair five hundred pound a year:</li>
  <li>Heaven guard my mother’s honour and my land!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN">
  <li>A good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,</li>
  <li>Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASTARD">
  <li>I know not why, except to get the land.</li>
  <li class="number">But once he slander’d me with bastardy:</li>
  <li>But whether I be as true begot or no,</li>
  <li>That still I lay upon my mother’s head,</li>
  <li>But that I am as well begot, my liege — </li>
  <li>Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me! — </li>
  <li class="number">Compare our faces and be judge yourself.</li>
  <li>If old sir Robert did beget us both</li>
  <li>And were our father and this son like him,</li>
  <li>O old sir Robert, father, on my knee</li>
  <li>I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN">
  <li class="number">Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN ELINOR">
  <li>He hath a trick of Coeur-de-lion’s face;</li>
  <li>The accent of his tongue affecteth him.</li>
  <li>Do you not read some tokens of my son</li>
  <li>In the large composition of this man?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN">
  <li class="number">Mine eye hath well examined his parts</li>
  <li>And finds them perfect Richard. Sirrah, speak,</li>
  <li>What doth move you to claim your brother’s land?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASTARD">
  <li>Because he hath a half-face, like my father.</li>
  <li>With half that face would he have all my land:</li>
  <li class="number">A half-faced groat five hundred pound a year!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROBERT">
  <li>My gracious liege, when that my father lived,</li>
  <li>Your brother did employ my father much — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASTARD">
  <li>Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land:</li>
  <li>Your tale must be how he employ’d my mother.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROBERT">
  <li class="number">And once dispatch’d him in an embassy</li>
  <li>To Germany, there with the emperor</li>
  <li>To treat of high affairs touching that time.</li>
  <li>The advantage of his absence took the king</li>
  <li>And in the mean time sojourn’d at my father’s;</li>
  <li class="number">Where how he did prevail I shame to speak,</li>
  <li>But truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shores</li>
  <li>Between my father and my mother lay,</li>
  <li>As I have heard my father speak himself,</li>
  <li>When this same lusty gentleman was got.</li>
  <li class="number">Upon his death-bed he by will bequeath’d</li>
  <li>His lands to me, and took it on his death</li>
  <li>That this my mother’s son was none of his;</li>
  <li>And if he were, he came into the world</li>
  <li>Full fourteen weeks before the course of time.</li>
  <li class="number">Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,</li>
  <li>My father’s land, as was my father’s will.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN">
  <li>Sirrah, your brother is legitimate;</li>
  <li>Your father’s wife did after wedlock bear him,</li>
  <li>And if she did play false, the fault was hers;</li>
  <li class="number">Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands</li>
  <li>That marry wives. Tell me, how if my brother,</li>
  <li>Who, as you say, took pains to get this son,</li>
  <li>Had of your father claim’d this son for his?</li>
  <li>In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept</li>
  <li class="number">This calf bred from his cow from all the world;</li>
  <li>In sooth he might; then, if he were my brother’s,</li>
  <li>My brother might not claim him; nor your father,</li>
  <li>Being none of his, refuse him: this concludes;</li>
  <li>My mother’s son did get your father’s heir;</li>
  <li class="number">Your father’s heir must have your father’s land.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROBERT">
  <li>Shall then my father’s will be of no force</li>
  <li>To dispossess that child which is not his?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASTARD">
  <li>Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,</li>
  <li>Than was his will to get me, as I think.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN ELINOR">
  <li class="number">Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge</li>
  <li>And like thy brother, to enjoy thy land,</li>
  <li>Or the reputed son of Coeur-de-lion,</li>
  <li>Lord of thy presence and no land beside?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASTARD">
  <li>Madam, an if my brother had my shape,</li>
  <li class="number">And I had his, sir Robert’s his, like him;</li>
  <li>And if my legs were two such riding-rods,</li>
  <li>My arms such eel-skins stuff’d, my face so thin</li>
  <li>That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose</li>
  <li>Lest men should say ’Look, where three-farthings goes!’</li>
  <li class="number">And, to his shape, were heir to all this land,</li>
  <li>Would I might never stir from off this place,</li>
  <li>I would give it every foot to have this face;</li>
  <li>I would not be sir Nob in any case.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN ELINOR">
  <li>I like thee well: wilt thou forsake thy fortune,</li>
  <li class="number">Bequeath thy land to him and follow me?</li>
  <li>I am a soldier and now bound to France.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASTARD">
  <li>Brother, take you my land, I’ll take my chance.</li>
  <li>Your face hath got five hundred pound a year,</li>
  <li>Yet sell your face for five pence and ’tis dear.</li>
  <li class="number">Madam, I’ll follow you unto the death.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN ELINOR">
  <li>Nay, I would have you go before me thither.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASTARD">
  <li>Our country manners give our betters way.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN">
  <li>What is thy name?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASTARD">
  <li>Philip, my liege, so is my name begun,</li>
  <li class="number">Philip, good old sir Robert’s wife’s eldest son.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN">
  <li>From henceforth bear his name whose form thou bear’st:</li>
  <li>Kneel thou down Philip, but rise more great,</li>
  <li>Arise sir Richard and Plantagenet.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASTARD">
  <li>Brother by the mother’s side, give me your hand:</li>
  <li class="number">My father gave me honour, yours gave land.</li>
  <li>Now blessed by the hour, by night or day,</li>
  <li>When I was got, sir Robert was away!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN ELINOR">
  <li>The very spirit of Plantagenet!</li>
  <li>I am thy grandam, Richard; call me so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASTARD">
  <li class="number">Madam, by chance but not by truth; what though?</li>
  <li>Something about, a little from the right,</li>
  <li>In at the window, or else o’er the hatch:</li>
  <li>Who dares not stir by day must walk by night,</li>
  <li>And have is have, however men do catch:</li>
  <li class="number">Near or far off, well won is still well shot,</li>
  <li>And I am I, howe’er I was begot.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN">
  <li>Go, Faulconbridge: now hast thou thy desire;</li>
  <li>A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.</li>
  <li>Come, madam, and come, Richard, we must speed</li>
  <li class="number">For France, for France, for it is more than need.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASTARD">
  <li>Brother, adieu: good fortune come to thee!</li>
  <li>For thou wast got i’ the way of honesty.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exeunt all but BASTARD</li>
  <li>A foot of honour better than I was;</li>
  <li>But many a many foot of land the worse.</li>
  <li class="number">Well, now can I make any Joan a lady.</li>
  <li>’Good den, sir Richard!’ — ’God-a-mercy, fellow!’ — </li>
  <li>And if his name be George, I’ll call him Peter;</li>
  <li>For new-made honour doth forget men’s names;</li>
  <li>’Tis too respective and too sociable</li>
  <li class="number">For your conversion. Now your traveller,</li>
  <li>He and his toothpick at my worship’s mess,</li>
  <li>And when my knightly stomach is sufficed,</li>
  <li>Why then I suck my teeth and catechise</li>
  <li>My picked man of countries: ’My dear sir,’</li>
  <li class="number">Thus, leaning on mine elbow, I begin,</li>
  <li>’I shall beseech you’ — that is question now;</li>
  <li>And then comes answer like an Absey book:</li>
  <li>’O sir,’ says answer, ’at your best command;</li>
  <li>At your employment; at your service, sir;’</li>
  <li class="number">’No, sir,’ says question, ’I, sweet sir, at yours:’</li>
  <li>And so, ere answer knows what question would,</li>
  <li>Saving in dialogue of compliment,</li>
  <li>And talking of the Alps and Apennines,</li>
  <li>The Pyrenean and the river Po,</li>
  <li class="number">It draws toward supper in conclusion so.</li>
  <li>But this is worshipful society</li>
  <li>And fits the mounting spirit like myself,</li>
  <li>For he is but a bastard to the time</li>
  <li>That doth not smack of observation;</li>
  <li class="number">And so am I, whether I smack or no;</li>
  <li>And not alone in habit and device,</li>
  <li>Exterior form, outward accoutrement,</li>
  <li>But from the inward motion to deliver</li>
  <li>Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age’s tooth:</li>
  <li class="number">Which, though I will not practise to deceive,</li>
  <li>Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;</li>
  <li>For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.</li>
  <li>But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?</li>
  <li>What woman-post is this? hath she no husband</li>
  <li class="number">That will take pains to blow a horn before her?</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter LADY FAULCONBRIDGE and GURNEY</li>
  <li>O me! it is my mother. How now, good lady!</li>
  <li>What brings you here to court so hastily?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY FAULCONBRIDGE">
  <li>Where is that slave, thy brother? where is he,</li>
  <li>That holds in chase mine honour up and down?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASTARD">
  <li class="number">My brother Robert? old sir Robert’s son?</li>
  <li>Colbrand the giant, that same mighty man?</li>
  <li>Is it sir Robert’s son that you seek so?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY FAULCONBRIDGE">
  <li>Sir Robert’s son! Ay, thou unreverend boy,</li>
  <li>Sir Robert’s son: why scorn’st thou at sir Robert?</li>
  <li class="number">He is sir Robert’s son, and so art thou.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASTARD">
  <li>James Gurney, wilt thou give us leave awhile?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GURNEY">
  <li>Good leave, good Philip.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASTARD">
  <li>Philip! sparrow: James,</li>
  <li>There’s toys abroad: anon I’ll tell thee more.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exit GURNEY</li>
  <li class="number">Madam, I was not old sir Robert’s son:</li>
  <li>Sir Robert might have eat his part in me</li>
  <li>Upon Good-Friday and ne’er broke his fast:</li>
  <li>Sir Robert could do well: marry, to confess,</li>
  <li>Could he get me? Sir Robert could not do it:</li>
  <li class="number">We know his handiwork: therefore, good mother,</li>
  <li>To whom am I beholding for these limbs?</li>
  <li>Sir Robert never holp to make this leg.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY FAULCONBRIDGE">
  <li>Hast thou conspired with thy brother too,</li>
  <li>That for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour?</li>
  <li class="number">What means this scorn, thou most untoward knave?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASTARD">
  <li>Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like.</li>
  <li>What! I am dubb’d! I have it on my shoulder.</li>
  <li>But, mother, I am not sir Robert’s son;</li>
  <li>I have disclaim’d sir Robert and my land;</li>
  <li class="number">Legitimation, name and all is gone:</li>
  <li>Then, good my mother, let me know my father;</li>
  <li>Some proper man, I hope: who was it, mother?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY FAULCONBRIDGE">
  <li>Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASTARD">
  <li>As faithfully as I deny the devil.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY FAULCONBRIDGE">
  <li class="number">King Richard Coeur-de-lion was thy father:</li>
  <li>By long and vehement suit I was seduced</li>
  <li>To make room for him in my husband’s bed:</li>
  <li>Heaven lay not my transgression to my charge!</li>
  <li>Thou art the issue of my dear offence,</li>
  <li class="number">Which was so strongly urged past my defence.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASTARD">
  <li>Now, by this light, were I to get again,</li>
  <li>Madam, I would not wish a better father.</li>
  <li>Some sins do bear their privilege on earth,</li>
  <li>And so doth yours; your fault was not your folly:</li>
  <li class="number">Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose,</li>
  <li>Subjected tribute to commanding love,</li>
  <li>Against whose fury and unmatched force</li>
  <li>The aweless lion could not wage the fight,</li>
  <li>Nor keep his princely heart from Richard’s hand.</li>
  <li class="number">He that perforce robs lions of their hearts</li>
  <li>May easily win a woman’s. Ay, my mother,</li>
  <li>With all my heart I thank thee for my father!</li>
  <li>Who lives and dares but say thou didst not well</li>
  <li>When I was got, I’ll send his soul to hell.</li>
  <li class="number">Come, lady, I will show thee to my kin;</li>
  <li>And they shall say, when Richard me begot,</li>
  <li>If thou hadst said him nay, it had been sin:</li>
  <li>Who says it was, he lies; I say ’twas not.</li>

<h3>SCENE I.  France. Before Angiers.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter AUSTRIA and forces, drums, etc. on one side:
on the other KING PHILIP and his power; LEWIS,
ARTHUR, CONSTANCE and attendants</div>

<ol data-speaker="LEWIS">
  <li>Before Angiers well met, brave Austria.</li>
  <li>Arthur, that great forerunner of thy blood,</li>
  <li>Richard, that robb’d the lion of his heart</li>
  <li>And fought the holy wars in Palestine,</li>
  <li class="number">By this brave duke came early to his grave:</li>
  <li>And for amends to his posterity,</li>
  <li>At our importance hither is he come,</li>
  <li>To spread his colours, boy, in thy behalf,</li>
  <li>And to rebuke the usurpation</li>
  <li class="number">Of thy unnatural uncle, English John:</li>
  <li>Embrace him, love him, give him welcome hither.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARTHUR">
  <li>God shall forgive you Coeur-de-lion’s death</li>
  <li>The rather that you give his offspring life,</li>
  <li>Shadowing their right under your wings of war:</li>
  <li class="number">I give you welcome with a powerless hand,</li>
  <li>But with a heart full of unstained love:</li>
  <li>Welcome before the gates of Angiers, duke.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEWIS">
  <li>A noble boy! Who would not do thee right?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUSTRIA">
  <li>Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss,</li>
  <li class="number">As seal to this indenture of my love,</li>
  <li>That to my home I will no more return,</li>
  <li>Till Angiers and the right thou hast in France,</li>
  <li>Together with that pale, that white-faced shore,</li>
  <li>Whose foot spurns back the ocean’s roaring tides</li>
  <li class="number">And coops from other lands her islanders,</li>
  <li>Even till that England, hedged in with the main,</li>
  <li>That water-walled bulwark, still secure</li>
  <li>And confident from foreign purposes,</li>
  <li>Even till that utmost corner of the west</li>
  <li class="number">Salute thee for her king: till then, fair boy,</li>
  <li>Will I not think of home, but follow arms.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CONSTANCE">
  <li>O, take his mother’s thanks, a widow’s thanks,</li>
  <li>Till your strong hand shall help to give him strength</li>
  <li>To make a more requital to your love!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUSTRIA">
  <li class="number">The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords</li>
  <li>In such a just and charitable war.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING PHILIP">
  <li>Well then, to work: our cannon shall be bent</li>
  <li>Against the brows of this resisting town.</li>
  <li>Call for our chiefest men of discipline,</li>
  <li class="number">To cull the plots of best advantages:</li>
  <li>We’ll lay before this town our royal bones,</li>
  <li>Wade to the market-place in Frenchmen’s blood,</li>
  <li>But we will make it subject to this boy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CONSTANCE">
  <li>Stay for an answer to your embassy,</li>
  <li class="number">Lest unadvised you stain your swords with blood:</li>
  <li>My Lord Chatillon may from England bring,</li>
  <li>That right in peace which here we urge in war,</li>
  <li>And then we shall repent each drop of blood</li>
  <li>That hot rash haste so indirectly shed.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter CHATILLON</div>

<ol data-speaker="KING PHILIP">
  <li class="number">A wonder, lady! lo, upon thy wish,</li>
  <li>Our messenger Chatillon is arrived!</li>
  <li>What England says, say briefly, gentle lord;</li>
  <li>We coldly pause for thee; Chatillon, speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CHATILLON">
  <li>Then turn your forces from this paltry siege</li>
  <li class="number">And stir them up against a mightier task.</li>
  <li>England, impatient of your just demands,</li>
  <li>Hath put himself in arms: the adverse winds,</li>
  <li>Whose leisure I have stay’d, have given him time</li>
  <li>To land his legions all as soon as I;</li>
  <li class="number">His marches are expedient to this town,</li>
  <li>His forces strong, his soldiers confident.</li>
  <li>With him along is come the mother-queen,</li>
  <li>An Ate, stirring him to blood and strife;</li>
  <li>With her her niece, the Lady Blanch of Spain;</li>
  <li class="number">With them a bastard of the king’s deceased,</li>
  <li>And all the unsettled humours of the land,</li>
  <li>Rash, inconsiderate, fiery voluntaries,</li>
  <li>With ladies’ faces and fierce dragons’ spleens,</li>
  <li>Have sold their fortunes at their native homes,</li>
  <li class="number">Bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs,</li>
  <li>To make hazard of new fortunes here:</li>
  <li>In brief, a braver choice of dauntless spirits</li>

<ol data-speaker="First Citizen">
  <li>That daughter there of Spain, the Lady Blanch,</li>
  <li>Is niece to England: look upon the years</li>
  <li>Of Lewis the Dauphin and that lovely maid:</li>
  <li class="number">If lusty love should go in quest of beauty,</li>
  <li>Where should he find it fairer than in Blanch?</li>
  <li>If zealous love should go in search of virtue,</li>
  <li>Where should he find it purer than in Blanch?</li>
  <li>If love ambitious sought a match of birth,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose veins bound richer blood than Lady Blanch?</li>
  <li>Such as she is, in beauty, virtue, birth,</li>
  <li>Is the young Dauphin every way complete:</li>

  <li>And she again wants nothing, to name want,</li>
  <li class="number">If want it be not that she is not he:</li>
  <li>He is the half part of a blessed man,</li>
  <li>Left to be finished by such as she;</li>
  <li>And she a fair divided excellence,</li>
  <li>Whose fulness of perfection lies in him.</li>
  <li class="number">O, two such silver currents, when they join,</li>
  <li>Do glorify the banks that bound them in;</li>
  <li>And two such shores to two such streams made one,</li>
  <li>Two such controlling bounds shall you be, kings,</li>
  <li>To these two princes, if you marry them.</li>
  <li class="number">This union shall do more than battery can</li>
  <li>To our fast-closed gates; for at this match,</li>

  <li>The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope,</li>
  <li>And give you entrance: but without this match,</li>
  <li class="number">The sea enraged is not half so deaf,</li>
  <li>Lions more confident, mountains and rocks</li>

  <li>In moral fury half so peremptory,</li>
  <li>As we to keep this city.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASTARD">
  <li class="number">Here’s a stay</li>

  <li>Talks as familiarly of roaring lions</li>
  <li class="number">As maids of thirteen do of puppy-dogs!</li>
  <li>What cannoneer begot this lusty blood?</li>
  <li>He speaks plain cannon fire, and smoke and bounce;</li>
  <li>He gives the bastinado with his tongue:</li>

  <li>Or if you will, to speak more properly,</li>

  <li>We will heal up all;</li>

  <li class="number">Some speedy messenger bid her repair</li>

<ol data-speaker="LEWIS">
  <li>Bethink you, father; for the difference</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING PHILIP">
  <li>Good reverend father, make my person yours,</li>
  <li class="number">And tell me how you would bestow yourself.</li>
  <li>This royal hand and mine are newly knit,</li>
  <li>And the conjunction of our inward souls</li>
  <li>Married in league, coupled and linked together</li>
  <li>With all religious strength of sacred vows;</li>
  <li class="number">The latest breath that gave the sound of words</li>
  <li>Was deep-sworn faith, peace, amity, true love</li>
  <li>Between our kingdoms and our royal selves,</li>
  <li>And even before this truce, but new before,</li>
  <li>No longer than we well could wash our hands</li>
  <li class="number">To clap this royal bargain up of peace,</li>
  <li>Heaven knows, they were besmear’d and over-stain’d</li>
  <li>With slaughter’s pencil, where revenge did paint</li>
  <li>The fearful difference of incensed kings:</li>
  <li>And shall these hands, so lately purged of blood,</li>
  <li class="number">So newly join’d in love, so strong in both,</li>
  <li>Unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet?</li>
  <li>Play fast and loose with faith? so jest with heaven,</li>
  <li>Make such unconstant children of ourselves,</li>
  <li>As now again to snatch our palm from palm,</li>
  <li class="number">Unswear faith sworn, and on the marriage-bed</li>
  <li>Of smiling peace to march a bloody host,</li>
  <li>And make a riot on the gentle brow</li>
  <li>Of true sincerity? O, holy sir,</li>
  <li>My reverend father, let it not be so!</li>
  <li class="number">Out of your grace, devise, ordain, impose</li>
  <li>Some gentle order; and then we shall be blest</li>
  <li>To do your pleasure and continue friends.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CARDINAL PANDULPH">
  <li>All form is formless, order orderless,</li>
  <li>Save what is opposite to England’s love.</li>

  <li>Or let the church, our mother, breathe her curse,</li>
  <li>A mother’s curse, on her revolting son.</li>
  <li>France, thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue,</li>
  <li>A chafed lion by the mortal paw,</li>
  <li class="number">A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,</li>
  <li>Than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING PHILIP">
  <li>I may disjoin my hand, but not my faith.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CARDINAL PANDULPH">
  <li>So makest thou faith an enemy to faith;</li>
  <li>And like a civil war set’st oath to oath,</li>
  <li class="number">Thy tongue against thy tongue. O, let thy vow</li>
  <li>First made to heaven, first be to heaven perform’d,</li>
  <li>That is, to be the champion of our church!</li>
  <li>What since thou sworest is sworn against thyself</li>
  <li>And may not be performed by thyself,</li>
  <li class="number">For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss</li>
  <li>Is not amiss when it is truly done,</li>
  <li>And being not done, where doing tends to ill,</li>
  <li>The truth is then most done not doing it:</li>
  <li>The better act of purposes mistook</li>
  <li class="number">Is to mistake again; though indirect,</li>
  <li>Yet indirection thereby grows direct,</li>
  <li>And falsehood falsehood cures, as fire cools fire</li>
  <li>Within the scorched veins of one new-burn’d.</li>
  <li>It is religion that doth make vows kept;</li>
  <li class="number">But thou hast sworn against religion,</li>
  <li>By what thou swear’st against the thing thou swear’st,</li>
  <li>And makest an oath the surety for thy truth</li>
  <li>Against an oath: the truth thou art unsure</li>
  <li>To swear, swears only not to be forsworn;</li>
  <li class="number">Else what a mockery should it be to swear!</li>
  <li>But thou dost swear only to be forsworn;</li>
  <li>And most forsworn, to keep what thou dost swear.</li>
  <li>Therefore thy later vows against thy first</li>
  <li>Is in thyself rebellion to thyself;</li>
  <li class="number">And better conquest never canst thou make</li>
  <li>Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts</li>
  <li>Against these giddy loose suggestions:</li>
  <li>Upon which better part our prayers come in,</li>
  <li>If thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then know</li>
  <li class="number">The peril of our curses light on thee</li>
  <li>So heavy as thou shalt not shake them off,</li>

<ol data-speaker="CARDINAL PANDULPH">
  <li>Your mind is all as youthful as your blood.</li>

  <li>John hath seized Arthur; and it cannot be</li>
  <li>That, whiles warm life plays in that infant’s veins,</li>
  <li class="number">The misplaced John should entertain an hour,</li>
  <li>One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest.</li>

  <li class="number">No natural exhalation in the sky,</li>
  <li>No scope of nature, no distemper’d day,</li>

  <li class="number">Abortives, presages and tongues of heaven,</li>
  <li>Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEWIS">
  <li>May be he will not touch young Arthur’s life,</li>
  <li>But hold himself safe in his prisonment.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CARDINAL PANDULPH">
  <li>O, sir, when he shall hear of your approach,</li>
  <li class="number">If that young Arthur be not gone already,</li>
  <li>Even at that news he dies; and then the hearts</li>
  <li>Of all his people shall revolt from him</li>
  <li>And kiss the lips of unacquainted change</li>
  <li>And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath</li>
  <li class="number">Out of the bloody fingers’ ends of John.</li>
  <li>Methinks I see this hurly all on foot:</li>
  <li>And, O, what better matter breeds for you</li>
  <li>Than I have named! The bastard Faulconbridge</li>
  <li>Is now in England, ransacking the church,</li>
  <li class="number">Offending charity: if but a dozen French</li>
  <li>Were there in arms, they would be as a call</li>
  <li>To train ten thousand English to their side,</li>
  <li>Or as a little snow, tumbled about,</li>
  <li>Anon becomes a mountain. O noble Dauphin,</li>
  <li class="number">Go with me to the king: ’tis wonderful</li>
  <li>What may be wrought out of their discontent,</li>
  <li>Now that their souls are topful of offence.</li>
  <li>For England go: I will whet on the king.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEWIS">
  <li>Strong reasons make strong actions: let us go:</li>

  <li>Is it my fault that I was Geffrey’s son?</li>

  <li class="number">And with my hand at midnight held your head,</li>

  <li>Ah, none but in this iron age would do it!</li>
  <li>The iron of itself, though heat red-hot,</li>

  <li class="number">Even in the matter of mine innocence;</li>
  <li>Nay, after that, consume away in rust</li>
  <li>But for containing fire to harm mine eye.</li>
  <li>Are you more stubborn-hard than hammer’d iron?</li>
  <li>An if an angel should have come to me</li>

  <li>Hubert, the utterance of a brace of tongues</li>
  <li>Must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes:</li>

  <li>Or, Hubert, if you will, cut out my tongue,</li>
  <li class="number">So I may keep mine eyes: O, spare mine eyes.</li>
  <li>Though to no use but still to look on you!</li>
  <li>Lo, by my truth, the instrument is cold</li>

  <li>There is no malice in this burning coal;</li>
  <li>The breath of heaven has blown his spirit out</li>

<ol data-speaker="HUBERT">
  <li>But with my breath I can revive it, boy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARTHUR">
  <li>An if you do, you will but make it blush</li>
  <li>And glow with shame of your proceedings, Hubert:</li>
  <li>Nay, it perchance will sparkle in your eyes;</li>
  <li class="number">And like a dog that is compell’d to fight,</li>
  <li>Snatch at his master that doth tarre him on.</li>
  <li>All things that you should use to do me wrong</li>
  <li>Deny their office: only you do lack</li>
  <li>That mercy which fierce fire and iron extends,</li>
  <li class="number">Creatures of note for mercy-lacking uses.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HUBERT">
  <li>Well, see to live; I will not touch thine eye</li>
  <li>For all the treasure that thine uncle owes:</li>
  <li>Yet am I sworn and I did purpose, boy,</li>
  <li>With this same very iron to burn them out.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARTHUR">
  <li class="number">O, now you look like Hubert! all this while</li>
  <li>You were disguised.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HUBERT">
  <li>Peace; no more. Adieu.</li>
  <li>Your uncle must not know but you are dead;</li>
  <li>I’ll fill these dogged spies with false reports:</li>
  <li class="number">And, pretty child, sleep doubtless and secure,</li>
  <li>That Hubert, for the wealth of all the world,</li>
  <li>Will not offend thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARTHUR">
  <li>O heaven! I thank you, Hubert.</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  KING JOHN’S palace.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter KING JOHN, PEMBROKE, SALISBURY, and other Lords</div>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN">
  <li>Here once again we sit, once again crown’d,</li>
  <li>And looked upon, I hope, with cheerful eyes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PEMBROKE">
  <li>This ’once again,’ but that your highness pleased,</li>
  <li>Was once superfluous: you were crown’d before,</li>
  <li class="number">And that high royalty was ne’er pluck’d off,</li>
  <li>The faiths of men ne’er stained with revolt;</li>
  <li>Fresh expectation troubled not the land</li>
  <li>With any long’d-for change or better state.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALISBURY">
  <li>Therefore, to be possess’d with double pomp,</li>
  <li class="number">To guard a title that was rich before,</li>
  <li>To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,</li>
  <li>To throw a perfume on the violet,</li>
  <li>To smooth the ice, or add another hue</li>
  <li>Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light</li>
  <li class="number">To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,</li>
  <li>Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PEMBROKE">
  <li>But that your royal pleasure must be done,</li>
  <li>This act is as an ancient tale new told,</li>
  <li>And in the last repeating troublesome,</li>
  <li class="number">Being urged at a time unseasonable.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALISBURY">
  <li>In this the antique and well noted face</li>
  <li>Of plain old form is much disfigured;</li>
  <li>And, like a shifted wind unto a sail,</li>
  <li>It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,</li>
  <li class="number">Startles and frights consideration,</li>
  <li>Makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected,</li>
  <li>For putting on so new a fashion’d robe.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PEMBROKE">
  <li>When workmen strive to do better than well,</li>
  <li>They do confound their skill in covetousness;</li>
  <li class="number">And oftentimes excusing of a fault</li>
  <li>Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse,</li>
  <li>As patches set upon a little breach</li>
  <li>Discredit more in hiding of the fault</li>
  <li>Than did the fault before it was so patch’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALISBURY">
  <li class="number">To this effect, before you were new crown’d,</li>
  <li>We breathed our counsel: but it pleased your highness</li>
  <li>To overbear it, and we are all well pleased,</li>
  <li>Since all and every part of what we would</li>
  <li>Doth make a stand at what your highness will.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN">
  <li class="number">Some reasons of this double coronation</li>
  <li>I have possess’d you with and think them strong;</li>
  <li>And more, more strong, then lesser is my fear,</li>
  <li>I shall indue you with: meantime but ask</li>
  <li>What you would have reform’d that is not well,</li>
  <li class="number">And well shall you perceive how willingly</li>
  <li>I will both hear and grant you your requests.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PEMBROKE">
  <li>Then I, as one that am the tongue of these,</li>
  <li>To sound the purpose of all their hearts,</li>
  <li>Both for myself and them, but, chief of all,</li>
  <li class="number">Your safety, for the which myself and them</li>
  <li>Bend their best studies, heartily request</li>
  <li>The enfranchisement of Arthur; whose restraint</li>
  <li>Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent</li>
  <li>To break into this dangerous argument — </li>
  <li class="number">If what in rest you have in right you hold,</li>
  <li>Why then your fears, which, as they say, attend</li>
  <li>The steps of wrong, should move you to mew up</li>
  <li>Your tender kinsman and to choke his days</li>
  <li>With barbarous ignorance and deny his youth</li>
  <li class="number">The rich advantage of good exercise?</li>
  <li>That the time’s enemies may not have this</li>
  <li>To grace occasions, let it be our suit</li>
  <li>That you have bid us ask his liberty;</li>
  <li>Which for our goods we do no further ask</li>
  <li class="number">Than whereupon our weal, on you depending,</li>
  <li>Counts it your weal he have his liberty.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter HUBERT</div>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN">
  <li>Let it be so: I do commit his youth</li>
  <li>To your direction. Hubert, what news with you?</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Taking him apart</div>

<ol data-speaker="PEMBROKE">
  <li>This is the man should do the bloody deed;</li>
  <li class="number">He show’d his warrant to a friend of mine:</li>
  <li>The image of a wicked heinous fault</li>
  <li>Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his</li>
  <li>Does show the mood of a much troubled breast;</li>
  <li>And I do fearfully believe ’tis done,</li>
  <li class="number">What we so fear’d he had a charge to do.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALISBURY">
  <li>The colour of the king doth come and go</li>
  <li>Between his purpose and his conscience,</li>
  <li>Like heralds ’twixt two dreadful battles set:</li>
  <li>His passion is so ripe, it needs must break.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PEMBROKE">
  <li class="number">And when it breaks, I fear will issue thence</li>
  <li>The foul corruption of a sweet child’s death.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN">
  <li>We cannot hold mortality’s strong hand:</li>
  <li>Good lords, although my will to give is living,</li>
  <li>The suit which you demand is gone and dead:</li>
  <li class="number">He tells us Arthur is deceased to-night.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALISBURY">
  <li>Indeed we fear’d his sickness was past cure.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PEMBROKE">
  <li>Indeed we heard how near his death he was</li>
  <li>Before the child himself felt he was sick:</li>
  <li>This must be answer’d either here or hence.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN">
  <li class="number">Why do you bend such solemn brows on me?</li>
  <li>Think you I bear the shears of destiny?</li>
  <li>Have I commandment on the pulse of life?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALISBURY">
  <li>It is apparent foul play; and ’tis shame</li>
  <li>That greatness should so grossly offer it:</li>
  <li class="number">So thrive it in your game! and so, farewell.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PEMBROKE">
  <li>Stay yet, Lord Salisbury; I’ll go with thee,</li>
  <li>And find the inheritance of this poor child,</li>
  <li>His little kingdom of a forced grave.</li>
  <li>That blood which owed the breadth of all this isle,</li>
  <li class="number">Three foot of it doth hold: bad world the while!</li>
  <li>This must not be thus borne: this will break out</li>
  <li>To all our sorrows, and ere long I doubt.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt Lords</div>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN">
  <li>They burn in indignation. I repent:</li>

<ol data-speaker="Messenger">
  <li class="number">My liege, her ear</li>

  <li>My lord, they say five moons were seen to-night;</li>
  <li class="number">Four fixed, and the fifth did whirl about</li>
  <li>The other four in wondrous motion.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN">
  <li>Five moons!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HUBERT">
  <li>Old men and beldams in the streets</li>
  <li>Do prophesy upon it dangerously:</li>
  <li class="number">Young Arthur’s death is common in their mouths:</li>
  <li>And when they talk of him, they shake their heads</li>
  <li>And whisper one another in the ear;</li>
  <li>And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer’s wrist,</li>
  <li>Whilst he that hears makes fearful action,</li>
  <li class="number">With wrinkled brows, with nods, with rolling eyes.</li>
  <li>I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,</li>
  <li>The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,</li>
  <li>With open mouth swallowing a tailor’s news;</li>
  <li>Who, with his shears and measure in his hand,</li>
  <li class="number">Standing on slippers, which his nimble haste</li>
  <li>Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet,</li>
  <li>Told of a many thousand warlike French</li>
  <li>That were embattailed and rank’d in Kent:</li>
  <li>Another lean unwash’d artificer</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN">
  <li>Why seek’st thou to possess me with these fears?</li>
  <li>Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur’s death?</li>
  <li>Thy hand hath murder’d him: I had a mighty cause</li>
  <li>To wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HUBERT">
  <li class="number">No had, my lord! why, did you not provoke me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN">
  <li>It is the curse of kings to be attended</li>
  <li>By slaves that take their humours for a warrant</li>
  <li>To break within the bloody house of life,</li>
  <li>And on the winking of authority</li>
  <li class="number">To understand a law, to know the meaning</li>
  <li>Of dangerous majesty, when perchance it frowns</li>
  <li>More upon humour than advised respect.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HUBERT">
  <li>Here is your hand and seal for what I did.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN">
  <li>O, when the last account ’twixt heaven and earth</li>

  <li>Witness against us to damnation!</li>
  <li>How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds</li>
  <li>Make deeds ill done! Hadst not thou been by,</li>
  <li>A fellow by the hand of nature mark’d,</li>
  <li class="number">Quoted and sign’d to do a deed of shame,</li>
  <li>This murder had not come into my mind:</li>

  <li>Finding thee fit for bloody villany,</li>
  <li>Apt, liable to be employ’d in danger,</li>
  <li class="number">I faintly broke with thee of Arthur’s death;</li>
  <li>And thou, to be endeared to a king,</li>
  <li>Made it no conscience to destroy a prince.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HUBERT">
  <li>My lord — </li>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN">
  <li>Hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause</li>
  <li class="number">When I spake darkly what I purposed,</li>
  <li>Or turn’d an eye of doubt upon my face,</li>
  <li>As bid me tell my tale in express words,</li>
  <li>Deep shame had struck me dumb, made me break off,</li>
  <li>And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me:</li>
  <li class="number">But thou didst understand me by my signs</li>
  <li>And didst in signs again parley with sin;</li>
  <li>Yea, without stop, didst let thy heart consent,</li>
  <li>And consequently thy rude hand to act</li>
  <li>The deed, which both our tongues held vile to name.</li>
  <li class="number">Out of my sight, and never see me more!</li>
  <li>My nobles leave me; and my state is braved,</li>
  <li>Even at my gates, with ranks of foreign powers:</li>
  <li>Nay, in the body of this fleshly land,</li>
  <li>This kingdom, this confine of blood and breath,</li>

<ol data-speaker="HUBERT">
  <li>Arm you against your other enemies,</li>
  <li>I’ll make a peace between your soul and you.</li>
  <li>Young Arthur is alive: this hand of mine</li>
  <li class="number">Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand,</li>
  <li>Not painted with the crimson spots of blood.</li>
  <li>Within this bosom never enter’d yet</li>
  <li>The dreadful motion of a murderous thought;</li>
  <li>And you have slander’d nature in my form,</li>
  <li class="number">Which, howsoever rude exteriorly,</li>
  <li>Is yet the cover of a fairer mind</li>
  <li>Than to be butcher of an innocent child.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN">
  <li>Doth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers,</li>
  <li>Throw this report on their incensed rage,</li>
  <li class="number">And make them tame to their obedience!</li>
  <li>Forgive the comment that my passion made</li>
  <li>Upon thy feature; for my rage was blind,</li>
  <li>And foul imaginary eyes of blood</li>
  <li>Presented thee more hideous than thou art.</li>
  <li class="number">O, answer not, but to my closet bring</li>
  <li>The angry lords with all expedient haste.</li>
  <li>I conjure thee but slowly; run more fast.</li>

  <li>This gentle offer of the perilous time.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PEMBROKE">
  <li>Who brought that letter from the cardinal?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALISBURY">
  <li class="number">The Count Melun, a noble lord of France,</li>
  <li>Whose private with me of the Dauphin’s love</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIGOT">
  <li>To-morrow morning let us meet him then.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALISBURY">
  <li>Or rather then set forward; for ’twill be</li>

  <li>Return and tell him so: we know the worst.</li>

<ol data-speaker="BASTARD">
  <li>Whate’er you think, good words, I think, were best.</li>

<ol data-speaker="SALISBURY">
  <li>Murder, as hating what himself hath done,</li>

  <li>That ever wall-eyed wrath or staring rage</li>
  <li class="number">Presented to the tears of soft remorse.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PEMBROKE">
  <li>All murders past do stand excused in this:</li>
  <li>And this, so sole and so unmatchable,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASTARD">
  <li>It is a damned and a bloody work;</li>
  <li>The graceless action of a heavy hand,</li>
  <li>If that it be the work of any hand.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALISBURY">
  <li class="number">If that it be the work of any hand!</li>
  <li>We had a kind of light what would ensue:</li>

  <li>The practise and the purpose of the king:</li>
  <li>From whose obedience I forbid my soul,</li>
  <li class="number">Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life,</li>

  <li class="number">Nor conversant with ease and idleness,</li>
  <li>Till I have set a glory to this hand,</li>

<ol data-speaker="SALISBURY">
  <li>Thou art a murderer.</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALISBURY">
  <li>Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes,</li>

  <li class="number">Away with me, all you whose souls abhor</li>
  <li>The uncleanly savours of a slaughter-house;</li>
  <li>For I am stifled with this smell of sin.</li>

  <li>Thou hast a perfect thought:</li>
  <li>I will upon all hazards well believe</li>
  <li class="number">Thou art my friend, that know’st my tongue so well.</li>
  <li>Who art thou?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASTARD">
  <li>Who thou wilt: and if thou please,</li>
  <li>Thou mayst befriend me so much as to think</li>
  <li>I come one way of the Plantagenets.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HUBERT">
  <li class="number">Unkind remembrance! thou and eyeless night</li>
  <li>Have done me shame: brave soldier, pardon me,</li>
  <li>That any accent breaking from thy tongue</li>
  <li>Should ’scape the true acquaintance of mine ear.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASTARD">
  <li>Come, come; sans compliment, what news abroad?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HUBERT">
  <li class="number">Why, here walk I in the black brow of night,</li>
  <li>To find you out.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASTARD">
  <li>Brief, then; and what’s the news?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HUBERT">
  <li>O, my sweet sir, news fitting to the night,</li>
  <li>Black, fearful, comfortless and horrible.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASTARD">
  <li class="number">Show me the very wound of this ill news:</li>
  <li>I am no woman, I’ll not swoon at it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HUBERT">
  <li>The king, I fear, is poison’d by a monk:</li>
  <li>I left him almost speechless; and broke out</li>
  <li>To acquaint you with this evil, that you might</li>
  <li class="number">The better arm you to the sudden time,</li>
  <li>Than if you had at leisure known of this.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASTARD">
  <li>How did he take it? who did taste to him?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HUBERT">
  <li>A monk, I tell you; a resolved villain,</li>
  <li>Whose bowels suddenly burst out: the king</li>
  <li class="number">Yet speaks and peradventure may recover.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASTARD">
  <li>Who didst thou leave to tend his majesty?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HUBERT">
  <li>Why, know you not? the lords are all come back,</li>
  <li>And brought Prince Henry in their company;</li>
  <li>At whose request the king hath pardon’d them,</li>
  <li class="number">And they are all about his majesty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASTARD">
  <li>Withhold thine indignation, mighty heaven,</li>
  <li>And tempt us not to bear above our power!</li>
  <li>I’ll tell tree, Hubert, half my power this night,</li>
  <li>Passing these flats, are taken by the tide;</li>
  <li class="number">These Lincoln Washes have devoured them;</li>
  <li>Myself, well mounted, hardly have escaped.</li>
  <li>Away before: conduct me to the king;</li>
  <li>I doubt he will be dead or ere I come.</li>

<h3>SCENE VII.  The orchard in Swinstead Abbey.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter PRINCE HENRY, SALISBURY, and BIGOT</div>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE HENRY">
  <li>It is too late: the life of all his blood</li>
  <li>Is touch’d corruptibly, and his pure brain,</li>
  <li>Which some suppose the soul’s frail dwelling-house,</li>
  <li>Doth by the idle comments that it makes</li>
  <li class="number">Foretell the ending of mortality.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter PEMBROKE</div>

<ol data-speaker="PEMBROKE">
  <li>His highness yet doth speak, and holds belief</li>
  <li>That, being brought into the open air,</li>
  <li>It would allay the burning quality</li>
  <li>Of that fell poison which assaileth him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE HENRY">
  <li class="number">Let him be brought into the orchard here.</li>
  <li>Doth he still rage?</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit BIGOT</div>

<ol data-speaker="PEMBROKE">
  <li>He is more patient</li>
  <li>Than when you left him; even now he sung.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE HENRY">
  <li>O vanity of sickness! fierce extremes</li>
  <li class="number">In their continuance will not feel themselves.</li>
  <li>Death, having prey’d upon the outward parts,</li>
  <li>Leaves them invisible, and his siege is now</li>
  <li>Against the mind, the which he pricks and wounds</li>
  <li>With many legions of strange fantasies,</li>
  <li class="number">Which, in their throng and press to that last hold,</li>
  <li>Confound themselves. ’Tis strange that death</li>
  <li>should sing.</li>
  <li>I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan,</li>
  <li>Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death,</li>
  <li class="number">And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings</li>
  <li>His soul and body to their lasting rest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALISBURY">
  <li>Be of good comfort, prince; for you are born</li>
  <li>To set a form upon that indigest</li>
  <li>Which he hath left so shapeless and so rude.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter Attendants, and BIGOT, carrying KING JOHN in a chair</div>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN">
  <li class="number">Ay, marry, now my soul hath elbow-room;</li>
  <li>It would not out at windows nor at doors.</li>
  <li>There is so hot a summer in my bosom,</li>
  <li>That all my bowels crumble up to dust:</li>
  <li>I am a scribbled form, drawn with a pen</li>
  <li class="number">Upon a parchment, and against this fire</li>
  <li>Do I shrink up.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE HENRY">
  <li>How fares your majesty?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN">
  <li>Poison’d — ill fare — dead, forsook, cast off:</li>
  <li>And none of you will bid the winter come</li>
  <li class="number">To thrust his icy fingers in my maw,</li>
  <li>Nor let my kingdom’s rivers take their course</li>
  <li>Through my burn’d bosom, nor entreat the north</li>
  <li>To make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips</li>
  <li>And comfort me with cold. I do not ask you much,</li>
  <li class="number">I beg cold comfort; and you are so strait</li>
  <li>And so ingrateful, you deny me that.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE HENRY">
  <li>O that there were some virtue in my tears,</li>
  <li>That might relieve you!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN">
  <li>The salt in them is hot.</li>
  <li class="number">Within me is a hell; and there the poison</li>
  <li>Is as a fiend confined to tyrannize</li>
  <li>On unreprievable condemned blood.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter the BASTARD</div>

<ol data-speaker="BASTARD">
  <li>O, I am scalded with my violent motion,</li>
  <li>And spleen of speed to see your majesty!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN">
  <li class="number">O cousin, thou art come to set mine eye:</li>
  <li>The tackle of my heart is crack’d and burn’d,</li>
  <li>And all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail</li>
  <li>Are turned to one thread, one little hair:</li>
  <li>My heart hath one poor string to stay it by,</li>
  <li class="number">Which holds but till thy news be uttered;</li>
  <li>And then all this thou seest is but a clod</li>
  <li>And module of confounded royalty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASTARD">
  <li>The Dauphin is preparing hitherward,</li>
  <li>Where heaven He knows how we shall answer him;</li>
  <li class="number">For in a night the best part of my power,</li>
  <li>As I upon advantage did remove,</li>
  <li>Were in the Washes all unwarily</li>
  <li>Devoured by the unexpected flood.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">KING JOHN dies</div>

<ol data-speaker="SALISBURY">
  <li>You breathe these dead news in as dead an ear.</li>
  <li class="number">My liege! my lord! but now a king, now thus.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE HENRY">
  <li>Even so must I run on, and even so stop.</li>
  <li>What surety of the world, what hope, what stay,</li>
  <li>When this was now a king, and now is clay?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASTARD">
  <li>Art thou gone so? I do but stay behind</li>
  <li class="number">To do the office for thee of revenge,</li>
  <li>And then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven,</li>
  <li>As it on earth hath been thy servant still.</li>
  <li>Now, now, you stars that move in your right spheres,</li>
  <li>Where be your powers? show now your mended faiths,</li>
  <li class="number">And instantly return with me again,</li>
  <li>To push destruction and perpetual shame</li>
  <li>Out of the weak door of our fainting land.</li>
  <li>Straight let us seek, or straight we shall be sought;</li>
  <li>The Dauphin rages at our very heels.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALISBURY">
  <li class="number">It seems you know not, then, so much as we:</li>
  <li>The Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest,</li>
  <li>Who half an hour since came from the Dauphin,</li>
  <li>And brings from him such offers of our peace</li>
  <li>As we with honour and respect may take,</li>
  <li class="number">With purpose presently to leave this war.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASTARD">
  <li>He will the rather do it when he sees</li>
  <li>Ourselves well sinewed to our defence.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALISBURY">
  <li>Nay, it is in a manner done already;</li>
  <li>For many carriages he hath dispatch’d</li>
  <li class="number">To the sea-side, and put his cause and quarrel</li>
  <li>To the disposing of the cardinal:</li>
  <li>With whom yourself, myself and other lords,</li>
  <li>If you think meet, this afternoon will post</li>
  <li>To consummate this business happily.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASTARD">
  <li class="number">Let it be so: and you, my noble prince,</li>
  <li>With other princes that may best be spared,</li>
  <li>Shall wait upon your father’s funeral.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE HENRY">
  <li>At Worcester must his body be interr’d;</li>
  <li>For so he will’d it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASTARD">
  <li class="number">Thither shall it then:</li>
  <li>And happily may your sweet self put on</li>
  <li>The lineal state and glory of the land!</li>
  <li>To whom with all submission, on my knee</li>
  <li>I do bequeath my faithful services</li>
  <li class="number">And true subjection everlastingly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SALISBURY">
  <li>And the like tender of our love we make,</li>
  <li>To rest without a spot for evermore.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE HENRY">
  <li>I have a kind soul that would give you thanks</li>
  <li>And knows not how to do it but with tears.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASTARD">
  <li class="number">O, let us pay the time but needful woe,</li>
  <li>Since it hath been beforehand with our griefs.</li>
  <li>This England never did, nor never shall,</li>
  <li>Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror,</li>
  <li>But when it first did help to wound itself.</li>
  <li class="number">Now these her princes are come home again,</li>
  <li>Come the three corners of the world in arms,</li>
  <li>And we shall shock them. Nought shall make us rue,</li>
  <li>If England to itself do rest but true.</li>
