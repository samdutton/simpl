<h3>SCENE I.  London. A street.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter GLOUCESTER, solus</div>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>Now is the winter of our discontent</li>
  <li>Made glorious summer by this sun of York;</li>
  <li>And all the clouds that lour’d upon our house</li>
  <li>In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.</li>
  <li class="number">Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;</li>
  <li>Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;</li>
  <li>Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,</li>
  <li>Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.</li>
  <li>Grim-visaged war hath smooth’d his wrinkled front;</li>
  <li class="number">And now, instead of mounting barded steeds</li>
  <li>To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,</li>
  <li>He capers nimbly in a lady’s chamber</li>
  <li>To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.</li>
  <li>But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;</li>
  <li>I, that am rudely stamp’d, and want love’s majesty</li>
  <li>To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;</li>
  <li>I, that am curtail’d of this fair proportion,</li>
  <li>Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,</li>
  <li class="number">Deformed, unfinish’d, sent before my time</li>
  <li>Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,</li>
  <li>And that so lamely and unfashionable</li>
  <li>That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;</li>
  <li>Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,</li>
  <li class="number">Have no delight to pass away the time,</li>
  <li>Unless to spy my shadow in the sun</li>
  <li>And descant on mine own deformity:</li>
  <li>And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,</li>
  <li>To entertain these fair well-spoken days,</li>
  <li class="number">I am determined to prove a villain</li>
  <li>And hate the idle pleasures of these days.</li>
  <li>Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,</li>
  <li>By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,</li>
  <li>To set my brother Clarence and the king</li>
  <li class="number">In deadly hate the one against the other:</li>
  <li>And if King Edward be as true and just</li>
  <li>As I am subtle, false and treacherous,</li>
  <li>This day should Clarence closely be mew’d up,</li>
  <li>About a prophecy, which says that ’G’</li>
  <li class="number">Of Edward’s heirs the murderer shall be.</li>
  <li>Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here</li>
  <li>Clarence comes.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter CLARENCE, guarded, and BRAKENBURY</li>
  <li>Brother, good day; what means this armed guard</li>
  <li>That waits upon your grace?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li class="number">His majesty</li>
  <li>Tendering my person’s safety, hath appointed</li>
  <li>This conduct to convey me to the Tower.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>Upon what cause?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li>Because my name is George.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li class="number">Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;</li>
  <li>He should, for that, commit your godfathers:</li>
  <li>O, belike his majesty hath some intent</li>
  <li>That you shall be new-christen’d in the Tower.</li>
  <li>But what’s the matter, Clarence?  may I know?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li class="number">Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest</li>
  <li>As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,</li>
  <li>He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;</li>
  <li>And from the cross-row plucks the letter G.</li>
  <li>And says a wizard told him that by G</li>
  <li class="number">His issue disinherited should be;</li>
  <li>And, for my name of George begins with G,</li>
  <li>It follows in his thought that I am he.</li>
  <li>These, as I learn, and such like toys as these</li>
  <li>Have moved his highness to commit me now.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li class="number">Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women:</li>
  <li>’Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:</li>
  <li>My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, ’tis she</li>
  <li>That tempers him to this extremity.</li>
  <li>Was it not she and that good man of worship,</li>
  <li class="number">Anthony Woodville, her brother there,</li>
  <li>That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,</li>
  <li>From whence this present day he is deliver’d?</li>
  <li>We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li>By heaven, I think there’s no man is secure</li>
  <li class="number">But the queen’s kindred and night-walking heralds</li>
  <li>That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.</li>
  <li>Heard ye not what an humble suppliant</li>
  <li>Lord hastings was to her for his delivery?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>Humbly complaining to her deity</li>
  <li class="number">Got my lord chamberlain his liberty.</li>
  <li>I’ll tell you what; I think it is our way,</li>
  <li>If we will keep in favour with the king,</li>
  <li>To be her men and wear her livery:</li>
  <li>The jealous o’erworn widow and herself,</li>
  <li class="number">Since that our brother dubb’d them gentlewomen.</li>
  <li>Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRAKENBURY">
  <li>I beseech your graces both to pardon me;</li>
  <li>His majesty hath straitly given in charge</li>
  <li>That no man shall have private conference,</li>
  <li class="number">Of what degree soever, with his brother.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>Even so; an’t please your worship, Brakenbury,</li>
  <li>You may partake of any thing we say:</li>
  <li>We speak no treason, man: we say the king</li>
  <li>Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen</li>
  <li class="number">Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;</li>
  <li>We say that Shore’s wife hath a pretty foot,</li>
  <li>A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;</li>
  <li>And that the queen’s kindred are made gentle-folks:</li>
  <li>How say you sir? Can you deny all this?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRAKENBURY">
  <li class="number">With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>Naught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow,</li>
  <li>He that doth naught with her, excepting one,</li>
  <li>Were best he do it secretly, alone.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRAKENBURY">
  <li>What one, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li class="number">Her husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRAKENBURY">
  <li>I beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal</li>
  <li>Forbear your conference with the noble duke.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li>We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>We are the queen’s abjects, and must obey.</li>
  <li class="number">Brother, farewell: I will unto the king;</li>
  <li>And whatsoever you will employ me in,</li>
  <li>Were it to call King Edward’s widow sister,</li>
  <li>I will perform it to enfranchise you.</li>
  <li>Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood</li>
  <li class="number">Touches me deeper than you can imagine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li>I know it pleaseth neither of us well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;</li>
  <li>Meantime, have patience.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li>I must perforce. Farewell.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt CLARENCE, BRAKENBURY, and Guard</div>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li class="number">Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne’er return.</li>
  <li>Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so,</li>
  <li>That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,</li>
  <li>If heaven will take the present at our hands.</li>
  <li>But who comes here? the new-deliver’d Hastings?</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter HASTINGS</div>

<ol data-speaker="HASTINGS">
  <li class="number">Good time of day unto my gracious lord!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>As much unto my good lord chamberlain!</li>
  <li>Well are you welcome to the open air.</li>
  <li>How hath your lordship brook’d imprisonment?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HASTINGS">
  <li>With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:</li>
  <li class="number">But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks</li>
  <li>That were the cause of my imprisonment.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;</li>
  <li>For they that were your enemies are his,</li>
  <li>And have prevail’d as much on him as you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HASTINGS">
  <li class="number">More pity that the eagle should be mew’d,</li>
  <li>While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>What news abroad?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HASTINGS">
  <li>No news so bad abroad as this at home;</li>
  <li>The King is sickly, weak and melancholy,</li>
  <li class="number">And his physicians fear him mightily.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.</li>
  <li>O, he hath kept an evil diet long,</li>
  <li>And overmuch consumed his royal person:</li>
  <li>’Tis very grievous to be thought upon.</li>
  <li class="number">What, is he in his bed?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HASTINGS">
  <li>He is.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>Go you before, and I will follow you.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exit HASTINGS</li>
  <li>He cannot live, I hope; and must not die</li>
  <li>Till George be pack’d with post-horse up to heaven.</li>
  <li class="number">I’ll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,</li>
  <li>With lies well steel’d with weighty arguments;</li>
  <li>And, if I fall not in my deep intent,</li>
  <li>Clarence hath not another day to live:</li>
  <li>Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,</li>
  <li class="number">And leave the world for me to bustle in!</li>
  <li>For then I’ll marry Warwick’s youngest daughter.</li>
  <li>What though I kill’d her husband and her father?</li>
  <li>The readiest way to make the wench amends</li>
  <li>Is to become her husband and her father:</li>
  <li class="number">The which will I; not all so much for love</li>
  <li>As for another secret close intent,</li>
  <li>By marrying her which I must reach unto.</li>
  <li>But yet I run before my horse to market:</li>
  <li>Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:</li>
  <li class="number">When they are gone, then must I count my gains.</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  The same. Another street.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter the corpse of KING HENRY the Sixth, Gentlemen
with halberds to guard it; LADY ANNE being the mourner</div>

<ol data-speaker="LADY ANNE">
  <li>Set down, set down your honourable load,</li>
  <li>If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,</li>
  <li>Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament</li>
  <li>The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.</li>
  <li class="number">Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!</li>
  <li>Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!</li>
  <li>Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!</li>
  <li>Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,</li>
  <li>To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne,</li>
  <li class="number">Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter’d son,</li>
  <li>Stabb’d by the selfsame hand that made these wounds!</li>
  <li>Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,</li>
  <li>I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.</li>
  <li>Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!</li>
  <li class="number">Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!</li>
  <li>Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!</li>
  <li>More direful hap betide that hated wretch,</li>
  <li>That makes us wretched by the death of thee,</li>
  <li>Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,</li>
  <li class="number">Or any creeping venom’d thing that lives!</li>
  <li>If ever he have child, abortive be it,</li>
  <li>Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,</li>
  <li>Whose ugly and unnatural aspect</li>
  <li>May fright the hopeful mother at the view;</li>
  <li class="number">And that be heir to his unhappiness!</li>
  <li>If ever he have wife, let her he made</li>
  <li>A miserable by the death of him</li>
  <li>As I am made by my poor lord and thee!</li>
  <li>Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,</li>
  <li class="number">Taken from Paul’s to be interred there;</li>
  <li>And still, as you are weary of the weight,</li>
  <li>Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry’s corse.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter GLOUCESTER</div>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY ANNE">
  <li>What black magician conjures up this fiend,</li>
  <li class="number">To stop devoted charitable deeds?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,</li>
  <li>I’ll make a corse of him that disobeys.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Gentleman">
  <li>My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>Unmanner’d dog! stand thou, when I command:</li>
  <li class="number">Advance thy halbert higher than my breast,</li>
  <li>Or, by Saint Paul, I’ll strike thee to my foot,</li>
  <li>And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY ANNE">
  <li>What, do you tremble? are you all afraid?</li>
  <li>Alas, I blame you not; for you are mortal,</li>
  <li class="number">And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.</li>
  <li>Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!</li>
  <li>Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,</li>
  <li>His soul thou canst not have; therefore be gone.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY ANNE">
  <li class="number">Foul devil, for God’s sake, hence, and trouble us not;</li>
  <li>For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,</li>
  <li>Fill’d it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.</li>
  <li>If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,</li>
  <li>Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.</li>
  <li class="number">O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry’s wounds</li>
  <li>Open their congeal’d mouths and bleed afresh!</li>
  <li>Blush, Blush, thou lump of foul deformity;</li>
  <li>For ’tis thy presence that exhales this blood</li>
  <li>From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;</li>
  <li class="number">Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,</li>
  <li>Provokes this deluge most unnatural.</li>
  <li>O God, which this blood madest, revenge his death!</li>
  <li>O earth, which this blood drink’st revenge his death!</li>
  <li>Either heaven with lightning strike the</li>
  <li class="number">murderer dead,</li>
  <li>Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,</li>
  <li>As thou dost swallow up this good king’s blood</li>
  <li>Which his hell-govern’d arm hath butchered!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>Lady, you know no rules of charity,</li>
  <li class="number">Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY ANNE">
  <li>Villain, thou know’st no law of God nor man:</li>
  <li>No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>But I know none, and therefore am no beast.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY ANNE">
  <li>O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li class="number">More wonderful, when angels are so angry.</li>
  <li>Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,</li>
  <li>Of these supposed-evils, to give me leave,</li>
  <li>By circumstance, but to acquit myself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY ANNE">
  <li>Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man,</li>
  <li class="number">For these known evils, but to give me leave,</li>
  <li>By circumstance, to curse thy cursed self.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have</li>
  <li>Some patient leisure to excuse myself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY ANNE">
  <li>Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make</li>
  <li class="number">No excuse current, but to hang thyself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>By such despair, I should accuse myself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY ANNE">
  <li>And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused;</li>
  <li>For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,</li>
  <li>Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li class="number">Say that I slew them not?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY ANNE">
  <li>Why, then they are not dead:</li>
  <li>But dead they are, and devilish slave, by thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>I did not kill your husband.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY ANNE">
  <li>Why, then he is alive.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li class="number">Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward’s hand.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY ANNE">
  <li>In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw</li>
  <li>Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood;</li>
  <li>The which thou once didst bend against her breast,</li>
  <li>But that thy brothers beat aside the point.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li class="number">I was provoked by her slanderous tongue,</li>
  <li>which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY ANNE">
  <li>Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind.</li>
  <li>Which never dreamt on aught but butcheries:</li>
  <li>Didst thou not kill this king?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li class="number">I grant ye.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY ANNE">
  <li>Dost grant me, hedgehog? then, God grant me too</li>
  <li>Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!</li>
  <li>O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>The fitter for the King of heaven, that hath him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY ANNE">
  <li class="number">He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither;</li>
  <li>For he was fitter for that place than earth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY ANNE">
  <li>And thou unfit for any place but hell.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY ANNE">
  <li class="number">Some dungeon.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>Your bed-chamber.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY ANNE">
  <li>I’ll rest betide the chamber where thou liest!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>So will it, madam till I lie with you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY ANNE">
  <li>I hope so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li class="number">I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,</li>
  <li>To leave this keen encounter of our wits,</li>
  <li>And fall somewhat into a slower method,</li>
  <li>Is not the causer of the timeless deaths</li>
  <li>Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,</li>
  <li class="number">As blameful as the executioner?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY ANNE">
  <li>Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>Your beauty was the cause of that effect;</li>
  <li>Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep</li>
  <li>To undertake the death of all the world,</li>
  <li class="number">So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY ANNE">
  <li>If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,</li>
  <li>These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>These eyes could never endure sweet beauty’s wreck;</li>
  <li>You should not blemish it, if I stood by:</li>
  <li class="number">As all the world is cheered by the sun,</li>
  <li>So I by that; it is my day, my life.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>I would they were, that I might die at once;</li>
  <li>For now they kill me with a living death.</li>
  <li>Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,</li>
  <li>Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:</li>
  <li class="number">These eyes that never shed remorseful tear,</li>
  <li>No, when my father York and Edward wept,</li>
  <li>To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made</li>
  <li>When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;</li>
  <li>Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,</li>

  <li>My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;</li>
  <li class="number">And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,</li>
  <li>Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.</li>
  <li>I never sued to friend nor enemy;</li>
  <li>My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;</li>
  <li>But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,</li>
  <li class="number">My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">She looks scornfully at him</li>
  <li>Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made</li>

  <li>If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,</li>
  <li>Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;</li>
  <li class="number">Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom.</li>
  <li>And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,</li>
  <li>I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,</li>
  <li>And humbly beg the death upon my knee.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">He lays his breast open: she offers at it with his sword</li>
  <li>Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,</li>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>Tush, that was in thy rage:</li>

  <li>Oh, he is young and his minority</li>

  <li>Is it concluded that he shall be protector?</li>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN ELIZABETH">
  <li class="number">The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby.</li>
  <li>To your good prayers will scarcely say amen.</li>
  <li>Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she’s your wife,</li>

  <li>I hate not you for her proud arrogance.</li>

<ol data-speaker="DERBY">
  <li class="number">I do beseech you, either not believe</li>
  <li>The envious slanders of her false accusers;</li>
  <li>Or, if she be accused in true report,</li>
  <li>Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceeds</li>

<ol data-speaker="BUCKINGHAM">
  <li>Madam, good hope; his grace speaks cheerfully.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN ELIZABETH">

<ol data-speaker="BUCKINGHAM">
  <li>Madam, we did: he desires to make atonement</li>

  <li>They do me wrong, and I will not endure it:</li>
  <li>Who are they that complain unto the king,</li>
  <li>That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?</li>
  <li class="number">By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly</li>
  <li>That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.</li>
  <li>Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,</li>
  <li>Smile in men’s faces, smooth, deceive and cog,</li>
  <li>Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,</li>
  <li class="number">I must be held a rancorous enemy.</li>
  <li>Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,</li>
  <li>But thus his simple truth must be abused</li>
  <li>By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?</li>

  <li>When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?</li>

  <li>A plague upon you all! His royal person — </li>
  <li>Whom God preserve better than you would wish! — </li>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN ELIZABETH">
  <li>Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.</li>
  <li>The king, of his own royal disposition,</li>
  <li>And not provoked by any suitor else;</li>
  <li class="number">Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred,</li>
  <li>Which in your outward actions shows itself</li>
  <li>Against my kindred, brothers, and myself,</li>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li class="number">I cannot tell: the world is grown so bad,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN ELIZABETH">
  <li>Come, come, we know your meaning, brother</li>
  <li class="number">Gloucester;</li>
  <li>You envy my advancement and my friends’:</li>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>Meantime, God grants that we have need of you:</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN ELIZABETH">
  <li>By Him that raised me to this careful height</li>

  <li>My lord, you do me shameful injury,</li>
  <li class="number">Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.</li>

  <li>What may she not? She may, yea, marry, may she — </li>

  <li>Out, devil! I remember them too well:</li>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,</li>
  <li>I was a pack-horse in his great affairs;</li>
  <li>A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,</li>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>In all which time you and your husband Grey</li>

<h3>SCENE IV.  London. The Tower.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter CLARENCE and BRAKENBURY</div>

<ol data-speaker="BRAKENBURY">
  <li>Why looks your grace so heavily today?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li>O, I have pass’d a miserable night,</li>
  <li>So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,</li>
  <li>That, as I am a Christian faithful man,</li>
  <li class="number">I would not spend another such a night,</li>
  <li>Though ’twere to buy a world of happy days,</li>
  <li>So full of dismal terror was the time!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRAKENBURY">
  <li>What was your dream? I long to hear you tell it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li>Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,</li>
  <li class="number">And was embark’d to cross to Burgundy;</li>
  <li>And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;</li>
  <li>Who from my cabin tempted me to walk</li>
  <li>Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,</li>
  <li>And cited up a thousand fearful times,</li>
  <li class="number">During the wars of York and Lancaster</li>
  <li>That had befall’n us. As we paced along</li>
  <li>Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,</li>
  <li>Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,</li>
  <li>Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,</li>
  <li class="number">Into the tumbling billows of the main.</li>
  <li>Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!</li>
  <li>What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!</li>
  <li>What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!</li>
  <li>Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;</li>
  <li class="number">Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw’d upon;</li>
  <li>Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,</li>
  <li>Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,</li>
  <li>All scatter’d in the bottom of the sea:</li>
  <li>Some lay in dead men’s skulls; and, in those holes</li>
  <li class="number">Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,</li>
  <li>As ’twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,</li>
  <li>Which woo’d the slimy bottom of the deep,</li>
  <li>And mock’d the dead bones that lay scatter’d by.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRAKENBURY">
  <li>Had you such leisure in the time of death</li>
  <li class="number">To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li>Methought I had; and often did I strive</li>
  <li>To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood</li>
  <li>Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth</li>
  <li>To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;</li>
  <li class="number">But smother’d it within my panting bulk,</li>
  <li>Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRAKENBURY">
  <li>Awaked you not with this sore agony?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li>O, no, my dream was lengthen’d after life;</li>
  <li>O, then began the tempest to my soul,</li>
  <li class="number">Who pass’d, methought, the melancholy flood,</li>
  <li>With that grim ferryman which poets write of,</li>
  <li>Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.</li>
  <li>The first that there did greet my stranger soul,</li>
  <li>Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;</li>
  <li class="number">Who cried aloud, ’What scourge for perjury</li>
  <li>Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?’</li>
  <li>And so he vanish’d: then came wandering by</li>
  <li>A shadow like an angel, with bright hair</li>
  <li>Dabbled in blood; and he squeak’d out aloud,</li>
  <li class="number">’Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,</li>
  <li>That stabb’d me in the field by Tewksbury;</li>
  <li>Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!’</li>
  <li>With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends</li>
  <li>Environ’d me about, and howled in mine ears</li>
  <li class="number">Such hideous cries, that with the very noise</li>
  <li>I trembling waked, and for a season after</li>
  <li>Could not believe but that I was in hell,</li>
  <li>Such terrible impression made the dream.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRAKENBURY">
  <li>No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you;</li>
  <li class="number">I promise, I am afraid to hear you tell it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li>O Brakenbury, I have done those things,</li>
  <li>Which now bear evidence against my soul,</li>
  <li>For Edward’s sake; and see how he requites me!</li>
  <li>O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,</li>
  <li class="number">But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,</li>
  <li>Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,</li>
  <li>O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!</li>
  <li>I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;</li>
  <li>My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRAKENBURY">
  <li class="number">I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">CLARENCE sleeps</li>
  <li>Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,</li>
  <li>Makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night.</li>
  <li>Princes have but their tides for their glories,</li>
  <li>An outward honour for an inward toil;</li>
  <li class="number">And, for unfelt imagination,</li>
  <li>They often feel a world of restless cares:</li>
  <li>So that, betwixt their tides and low names,</li>
  <li>There’s nothing differs but the outward fame.</li>

<ol data-speaker="Second Murderer">
  <li>What, shall we stab him as he sleeps?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Murderer">
  <li>No; then he will say ’twas done cowardly, when he wakes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Murderer">
  <li class="number">When he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake till</li>
  <li>the judgment-day.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Murderer">
  <li>Why, then he will say we stabbed him sleeping.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Murderer">
  <li>The urging of that word ’judgment’ hath bred a kind</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Murderer">
  <li class="number">What, art thou afraid?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Murderer">
  <li>Not to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to be</li>
  <li>damned for killing him, from which no warrant can defend us.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Murderer">
  <li>I thought thou hadst been resolute.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Murderer">
  <li>So I am, to let him live.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Murderer">
  <li class="number">Back to the Duke of Gloucester, tell him so.</li>

<ol data-speaker="Second Murderer">
  <li>I pray thee, stay a while: I hope my holy humour</li>

  <li>would tell twenty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Murderer">
  <li>How dost thou feel thyself now?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Murderer">

<ol data-speaker="Second Murderer">

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Murderer">
  <li>So when he opens his purse to give us our reward,</li>
  <li>thy conscience flies out.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Murderer">
  <li>Let it go; there’s few or none will entertain it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Murderer">
  <li>How if it come to thee again?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Murderer">
  <li class="number">I’ll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous thing: it</li>
  <li>makes a man a coward: a man cannot steal, but it</li>
  <li>accuseth him; he cannot swear, but it cheques him;</li>
  <li>he cannot lie with his neighbour’s wife, but it</li>
  <li>detects him: ’tis a blushing shamefast spirit that</li>
  <li class="number">mutinies in a man’s bosom; it fills one full of</li>
  <li>obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold</li>
  <li>that I found; it beggars any man that keeps it: it</li>
  <li>is turned out of all towns and cities for a</li>
  <li>dangerous thing; and every man that means to live</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Murderer">
  <li>’Zounds, it is even now at my elbow, persuading me</li>

  <li>Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.</li>

<ol data-speaker="Second Murderer">
  <li>My voice is now the king’s, my looks mine own.</li>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li>How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!</li>
  <li class="number">Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?</li>
  <li>Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Both">
  <li>To, to, to — </li>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li>To murder me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Both">
  <li>Ay, ay.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li class="number">You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,</li>
  <li>And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.</li>
  <li>Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Murderer">
  <li>Offended us you have not, but the king.</li>

  <li>I shall be reconciled to him again.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Murderer">
  <li class="number">Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li>Are you call’d forth from out a world of men</li>
  <li>To slay the innocent? What is my offence?</li>
  <li>Where are the evidence that do accuse me?</li>
  <li>What lawful quest have given their verdict up</li>
  <li class="number">Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced</li>
  <li>The bitter sentence of poor Clarence’ death?</li>
  <li>Before I be convict by course of law,</li>
  <li>To threaten me with death is most unlawful.</li>
  <li>I charge you, as you hope to have redemption</li>
  <li class="number">By Christ’s dear blood shed for our grievous sins,</li>
  <li>That you depart and lay no hands on me</li>
  <li>The deed you undertake is damnable.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Murderer">
  <li>What we will do, we do upon command.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Murderer">
  <li>And he that hath commanded is the king.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li class="number">Erroneous vassal! the great King of kings</li>
  <li>Hath in the tables of his law commanded</li>
  <li>That thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then,</li>
  <li>Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man’s?</li>
  <li>Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hands,</li>
  <li class="number">To hurl upon their heads that break his law.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Murderer">
  <li>And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee,</li>
  <li>For false forswearing and for murder too:</li>
  <li>Thou didst receive the holy sacrament,</li>
  <li>To fight in quarrel of the house of Lancaster.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Murderer">
  <li class="number">And, like a traitor to the name of God,</li>
  <li>Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade</li>
  <li>Unrip’dst the bowels of thy sovereign’s son.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Murderer">
  <li>Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Murderer">
  <li>How canst thou urge God’s dreadful law to us,</li>
  <li class="number">When thou hast broke it in so dear degree?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li>Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?</li>
  <li>For Edward, for my brother, for his sake: Why, sirs,</li>
  <li>He sends ye not to murder me for this</li>
  <li>For in this sin he is as deep as I.</li>
  <li class="number">If God will be revenged for this deed.</li>
  <li>O, know you yet, he doth it publicly,</li>
  <li>Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm;</li>
  <li>He needs no indirect nor lawless course</li>
  <li>To cut off those that have offended him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Murderer">
  <li class="number">Who made thee, then, a bloody minister,</li>
  <li>When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,</li>
  <li>That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li>My brother’s love, the devil, and my rage.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Murderer">
  <li>Thy brother’s love, our duty, and thy fault,</li>
  <li class="number">Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li>Oh, if you love my brother, hate not me;</li>
  <li>I am his brother, and I love him well.</li>
  <li>If you be hired for meed, go back again,</li>
  <li>And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,</li>
  <li class="number">Who shall reward you better for my life</li>
  <li>Than Edward will for tidings of my death.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Murderer">
  <li>You are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li>O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:</li>
  <li>Go you to him from me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Both">
  <li class="number">Ay, so we will.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li>Tell him, when that our princely father York</li>
  <li>Bless’d his three sons with his victorious arm,</li>
  <li>And charged us from his soul to love each other,</li>
  <li>He little thought of this divided friendship:</li>
  <li class="number">Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Murderer">
  <li>Ay, millstones; as be lesson’d us to weep.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li>O, do not slander him, for he is kind.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Murderer">
  <li>Right,</li>
  <li>As snow in harvest. Thou deceivest thyself:</li>
  <li class="number">’Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li>It cannot be; for when I parted with him,</li>
  <li>He hugg’d me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,</li>
  <li>That he would labour my delivery.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Murderer">
  <li>Why, so he doth, now he delivers thee</li>
  <li class="number">From this world’s thraldom to the joys of heaven.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Murderer">
  <li>Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li>Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,</li>
  <li>To counsel me to make my peace with God,</li>
  <li>And art thou yet to thy own soul so blind,</li>
  <li class="number">That thou wilt war with God by murdering me?</li>
  <li>Ah, sirs, consider, he that set you on</li>
  <li>To do this deed will hate you for the deed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Murderer">
  <li>What shall we do?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li>Relent, and save your souls.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Murderer">
  <li class="number">Relent! ’tis cowardly and womanish.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li>Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.</li>
  <li>Which of you, if you were a prince’s son,</li>
  <li>Being pent from liberty, as I am now,</li>
  <li>if two such murderers as yourselves came to you,</li>
  <li class="number">Would not entreat for life?</li>
  <li>My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks:</li>
  <li>O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,</li>
  <li>Come thou on my side, and entreat for me,</li>
  <li>As you would beg, were you in my distress</li>
  <li class="number">A begging prince what beggar pities not?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Murderer">
  <li>Look behind you, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Murderer">
  <li>Take that, and that: if all this will not do,</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Stabs him</li>
  <li>I’ll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit, with the body</div>

<ol data-speaker="Second Murderer">
  <li>A bloody deed, and desperately dispatch’d!</li>
  <li class="number">How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands</li>
  <li>Of this most grievous guilty murder done!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Re-enter First Murderer</div>

<ol data-speaker="First Murderer">
  <li>How now! what mean’st thou, that thou help’st me not?</li>
  <li>By heavens, the duke shall know how slack thou art!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Murderer">
  <li>I would he knew that I had saved his brother!</li>
  <li class="number">Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say;</li>
  <li>For I repent me that the duke is slain.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<ol data-speaker="First Murderer">
  <li>So do not I: go, coward as thou art.</li>
  <li>Now must I hide his body in some hole,</li>

  <li class="number">And when I have my meed, I must away;</li>
  <li>For this will out, and here I must not stay.</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li>Take heed you dally not before your king;</li>
  <li>Lest he that is the supreme King of kings</li>
  <li>Confound your hidden falsehood, and award</li>
  <li class="number">Either of you to be the other’s end.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HASTINGS">
  <li>So prosper I, as I swear perfect love!</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li>Madam, yourself are not exempt in this,</li>

  <li>This interchange of love, I here protest,</li>

  <li>Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,</li>
  <li class="number">Be he unto me! this do I beg of God,</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li>A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,</li>

  <li>Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day.</li>

  <li>First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,</li>
  <li>Which I will purchase with my duteous service;</li>
  <li class="number">Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,</li>
  <li>If ever any grudge were lodged between us;</li>
  <li>Of you, Lord Rivers, and, Lord Grey, of you;</li>
  <li>That without desert have frown’d on me;</li>

  <li class="number">I do not know that Englishman alive</li>
  <li>With whom my soul is any jot at odds</li>
  <li>More than the infant that is born to-night</li>
  <li>I thank my God for my humility.</li>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN ELIZABETH">
  <li>A holy day shall this be kept hereafter:</li>
  <li class="number">I would to God all strifes were well compounded.</li>
  <li>My sovereign liege, I do beseech your majesty</li>

  <li>To be so bouted in this royal presence?</li>
  <li class="number">Who knows not that the noble duke is dead?</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">They all start</li>

  <li>Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?</li>

<ol data-speaker="DORSET">
  <li class="number">Ay, my good lord; and no one in this presence</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li>Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed.</li>

  <li>God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,</li>

  <li>Who sued to me for him? who, in my rage,</li>
  <li>Kneel’d at my feet, and bade me be advised</li>
  <li>Who spake of brotherhood? who spake of love?</li>
  <li class="number">Who told me how the poor soul did forsake</li>
  <li>The mighty Warwick, and did fight for me?</li>
  <li>Who told me, in the field by Tewksbury</li>
  <li>When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,</li>
  <li>And said, ’Dear brother, live, and be a king’?</li>
  <li class="number">Who told me, when we both lay in the field</li>
  <li>Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me</li>
  <li>Even in his own garments, and gave himself,</li>

  <li>All this from my remembrance brutish wrath</li>
  <li class="number">Sinfully pluck’d, and not a man of you</li>

  <li>But when your carters or your waiting-vassals</li>

  <li>O God, I fear thy justice will take hold</li>

  <li>Why do you wring your hands, and beat your breast,</li>

  <li>My pretty cousins, you mistake me much;</li>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li>Ay, mother; but I would not have it so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUCHESS OF YORK">
  <li>Why, my young cousin, it is good to grow.</li>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li class="number">Grandam, one night, as we did sit at supper,</li>

  <li>Gloucester,</li>
  <li>’Small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow apace:’</li>
  <li class="number">And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUCHESS OF YORK">
  <li>Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold</li>
  <li>In him that did object the same to thee;</li>
  <li>He was the wretched’st thing when he was young,</li>

<ol data-speaker="ARCHBISHOP OF YORK">
  <li>Why, madam, so, no doubt, he is.</li>

  <li>Now, by my troth, if I had been remember’d,</li>

<ol data-speaker="DUCHESS OF YORK">
  <li>How, my pretty York? I pray thee, let me hear it.</li>

  <li>Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.</li>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts’ sovereign</li>
  <li>The weary way hath made you melancholy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE EDWARD">
  <li>No, uncle; but our crosses on the way</li>
  <li class="number">Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy</li>
  <li>I want more uncles here to welcome me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years</li>
  <li>Hath not yet dived into the world’s deceit</li>
  <li>Nor more can you distinguish of a man</li>
  <li class="number">Than of his outward show; which, God he knows,</li>
  <li>Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.</li>
  <li>Those uncles which you want were dangerous;</li>
  <li>Your grace attended to their sugar’d words,</li>
  <li>But look’d not on the poison of their hearts :</li>
  <li class="number">God keep you from them, and from such false friends!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE EDWARD">
  <li>God keep me from false friends! but they were none.</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HASTINGS">
  <li>On what occasion, God he knows, not I,</li>
  <li>The queen your mother, and your brother York,</li>
  <li>Have taken sanctuary: the tender prince</li>
  <li>Would fain have come with me to meet your grace,</li>
  <li class="number">But by his mother was perforce withheld.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCKINGHAM">
  <li>Fie, what an indirect and peevish course</li>
  <li>Is this of hers! Lord cardinal, will your grace</li>
  <li>Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York</li>
  <li>Unto his princely brother presently?</li>
  <li class="number">If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,</li>
  <li>And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CARDINAL">
  <li>My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory</li>
  <li>Can from his mother win the Duke of York,</li>
  <li>Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate</li>
  <li class="number">To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid</li>
  <li>We should infringe the holy privilege</li>
  <li>Of blessed sanctuary! not for all this land</li>
  <li>Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCKINGHAM">
  <li>You are too senseless — obstinate, my lord,</li>
  <li class="number">Too ceremonious and traditional</li>
  <li>Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,</li>
  <li>You break not sanctuary in seizing him.</li>
  <li>The benefit thereof is always granted</li>
  <li>To those whose dealings have deserved the place,</li>
  <li class="number">And those who have the wit to claim the place:</li>
  <li>This prince hath neither claim’d it nor deserved it;</li>
  <li>And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:</li>
  <li>Then, taking him from thence that is not there,</li>
  <li>You break no privilege nor charter there.</li>
  <li class="number">Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;</li>
  <li>But sanctuary children ne’er till now.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CARDINAL">
  <li>My lord, you shall o’er-rule my mind for once.</li>
  <li>Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?</li>

  <li>Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,</li>
  <li>Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?</li>

  <li>If I may counsel you, some day or two</li>
  <li class="number">Your highness shall repose you at the Tower:</li>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>I say, without characters, fame lives long.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Aside</li>
  <li>Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,</li>
  <li>I moralize two meanings in one word.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE EDWARD">

<ol data-speaker="BUCKINGHAM">
  <li>Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of York.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE EDWARD">
  <li>Richard of York! how fares our loving brother?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li>Well, my dread lord; so must I call you now.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE EDWARD">
  <li>Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours:</li>
  <li class="number">Too late he died that might have kept that title,</li>
  <li>Which by his death hath lost much majesty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li>I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,</li>
  <li>You said that idle weeds are fast in growth</li>
  <li class="number">The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>He hath, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li>And therefore is he idle?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li>Then is he more beholding to you than I.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li class="number">He may command me as my sovereign;</li>
  <li>But you have power in me as in a kinsman.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li>I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>My dagger, little cousin? with all my heart.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE EDWARD">
  <li>A beggar, brother?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li class="number">Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;</li>
  <li>And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>A greater gift than that I’ll give my cousin.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li>A greater gift! O, that’s the sword to it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>A gentle cousin, were it light enough.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li class="number">O, then, I see, you will part but with light gifts;</li>
  <li>In weightier things you’ll say a beggar nay.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>It is too heavy for your grace to wear.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li>I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>What, would you have my weapon, little lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li class="number">I would, that I might thank you as you call me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>How?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li>Little.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE EDWARD">
  <li>My Lord of York will still be cross in talk:</li>
  <li>Uncle, your grace knows how to bear with him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li class="number">You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me:</li>
  <li>Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;</li>
  <li>Because that I am little, like an ape,</li>
  <li>He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCKINGHAM">
  <li>With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!</li>
  <li class="number">To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,</li>
  <li>He prettily and aptly taunts himself:</li>
  <li>So cunning and so young is wonderful.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>My lord, will’t please you pass along?</li>
  <li>Myself and my good cousin Buckingham</li>
  <li class="number">Will to your mother, to entreat of her</li>
  <li>To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li>What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE EDWARD">
  <li>My lord protector needs will have it so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li>I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li class="number">Why, what should you fear?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li>Marry, my uncle Clarence’ angry ghost:</li>
  <li>My grandam told me he was murdered there.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE EDWARD">
  <li>I fear no uncles dead.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>Nor none that live, I hope.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE EDWARD">
  <li class="number">An if they live, I hope I need not fear.</li>
  <li>But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart,</li>
  <li>Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.</li>

<ol data-speaker="BUCKINGHAM">
  <li>Think you, my lord, this little prating York</li>

  <li class="number">To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">

  <li>He is all the mother’s, from the top to toe.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCKINGHAM">
  <li>Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.</li>
  <li class="number">Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend</li>
  <li>As closely to conceal what we impart:</li>
  <li>Thou know’st our reasons urged upon the way;</li>
  <li>What think’st thou? is it not an easy matter</li>
  <li>To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,</li>
  <li class="number">For the instalment of this noble duke</li>
  <li>In the seat royal of this famous isle?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CATESBY">
  <li>He for his father’s sake so loves the prince,</li>

<ol data-speaker="BUCKINGHAM">
  <li>What think’st thou, then, of Stanley? what will he?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CATESBY">
  <li class="number">He will do all in all as Hastings doth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCKINGHAM">
  <li>Well, then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby,</li>
  <li>And, as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings,</li>
  <li>How doth he stand affected to our purpose;</li>
  <li>And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,</li>
  <li class="number">To sit about the coronation.</li>
  <li>If thou dost find him tractable to us,</li>
  <li>Encourage him, and show him all our reasons:</li>
  <li>If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling,</li>
  <li>Be thou so too; and so break off your talk,</li>
  <li class="number">And give us notice of his inclination:</li>
  <li>For we to-morrow hold divided councils,</li>
  <li>Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>Commend me to Lord William: tell him, Catesby,</li>
  <li>His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries</li>
  <li class="number">To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret-castle;</li>
  <li>And bid my friend, for joy of this good news,</li>

  <li>Whereof the king my brother stood possess’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCKINGHAM">
  <li>I’ll claim that promise at your grace’s hands.</li>
</ol>

  <li>Cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights?</li>

<ol data-speaker="Messenger">
  <li>So it should seem by that I have to say.</li>
  <li>First, he commends him to your noble lordship.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HASTINGS">
  <li>And then?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Messenger">
  <li class="number">And then he sends you word</li>
  <li>He dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm:</li>
  <li>Besides, he says there are two councils held;</li>
  <li>And that may be determined at the one</li>
  <li>which may make you and him to rue at the other.</li>
  <li class="number">Therefore he sends to know your lordship’s pleasure,</li>

  <li>Whereof I shall not have intelligence.</li>

  <li>And for his dreams, I wonder he is so fond</li>
  <li>To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers</li>
  <li>To fly the boar before the boar pursues,</li>
  <li>Were to incense the boar to follow us</li>
  <li class="number">And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.</li>
  <li>Go, bid thy master rise and come to me</li>
  <li>And we will both together to the Tower,</li>

  <li>That this same very day your enemies,</li>
  <li class="number">The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HASTINGS">

  <li>Ah! and did they so?</li>

  <li class="number">To be spoke to but by the recorder.</li>
  <li>Then he was urged to tell my tale again,</li>
  <li>’Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr’d;’</li>

  <li>When he had done, some followers of mine own,</li>

  <li>Your right of birth, your empery, your own.</li>
  <li>For this, consorted with the citizens,</li>
  <li class="number">Your very worshipful and loving friends,</li>
  <li>And by their vehement instigation,</li>
  <li>In this just suit come I to move your grace.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>I know not whether to depart in silence,</li>
  <li>Or bitterly to speak in your reproof.</li>
  <li class="number">Best fitteth my degree or your condition</li>
  <li>If not to answer, you might haply think</li>
  <li>Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded</li>
  <li>To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,</li>
  <li>Which fondly you would here impose on me;</li>
  <li class="number">If to reprove you for this suit of yours,</li>
  <li>So season’d with your faithful love to me.</li>
  <li>Then, on the other side, I cheque’d my friends.</li>
  <li>Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,</li>
  <li>And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,</li>
  <li class="number">Definitively thus I answer you.</li>
  <li>Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert</li>
  <li>Unmeritable shuns your high request.</li>
  <li>First if all obstacles were cut away,</li>
  <li>And that my path were even to the crown,</li>
  <li class="number">As my ripe revenue and due by birth</li>
  <li>Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,</li>
  <li>So mighty and so many my defects,</li>
  <li>As I had rather hide me from my greatness,</li>
  <li>Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,</li>
  <li class="number">Than in my greatness covet to be hid,</li>
  <li>And in the vapour of my glory smother’d.</li>
  <li>But, God be thank’d, there’s no need of me,</li>
  <li>And much I need to help you, if need were;</li>
  <li>The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,</li>
  <li class="number">Which, mellow’d by the stealing hours of time,</li>
  <li>Will well become the seat of majesty,</li>
  <li>And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.</li>
  <li>On him I lay what you would lay on me,</li>
  <li>The right and fortune of his happy stars;</li>
  <li class="number">Which God defend that I should wring from him!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCKINGHAM">
  <li>My lord, this argues conscience in your grace;</li>
  <li>But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,</li>
  <li>All circumstances well considered.</li>
  <li>You say that Edward is your brother’s son:</li>
  <li class="number">So say we too, but not by Edward’s wife;</li>
  <li>For first he was contract to Lady Lucy — </li>
  <li>Your mother lives a witness to that vow — </li>
  <li>And afterward by substitute betroth’d</li>
  <li>To Bona, sister to the King of France.</li>
  <li class="number">These both put by a poor petitioner,</li>
  <li>A care-crazed mother of a many children,</li>
  <li>A beauty-waning and distressed widow,</li>
  <li>Even in the afternoon of her best days,</li>
  <li>Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,</li>
  <li class="number">Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts</li>
  <li>To base declension and loathed bigamy</li>
  <li>By her, in his unlawful bed, he got</li>
  <li>This Edward, whom our manners term the prince.</li>
  <li>More bitterly could I expostulate,</li>
  <li class="number">Save that, for reverence to some alive,</li>
  <li>I give a sparing limit to my tongue.</li>
  <li>Then, good my lord, take to your royal self</li>
  <li>This proffer’d benefit of dignity;</li>
  <li>If non to bless us and the land withal,</li>
  <li class="number">Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry</li>
  <li>From the corruption of abusing times,</li>
  <li>Unto a lineal true-derived course.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Lord Mayor">
  <li>Do, good my lord, your citizens entreat you.</li>

<ol data-speaker="CATESBY">
  <li class="number">O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>Alas, why would you heap these cares on me?</li>
  <li>I am unfit for state and majesty;</li>
  <li>I do beseech you, take it not amiss;</li>
  <li>I cannot nor I will not yield to you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCKINGHAM">
  <li class="number">If you refuse it — as, in love and zeal,</li>
  <li>Loath to depose the child, Your brother’s son;</li>
  <li>As well we know your tenderness of heart</li>
  <li>And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,</li>
  <li>Which we have noted in you to your kin,</li>
  <li class="number">And egally indeed to all estates — </li>
  <li>Yet whether you accept our suit or no,</li>
  <li>Your brother’s son shall never reign our king;</li>
  <li>But we will plant some other in the throne,</li>
  <li>To the disgrace and downfall of your house:</li>
  <li class="number">And in this resolution here we leave you. — </li>
  <li>Come, citizens: ’zounds! I’ll entreat no more.</li>

  <li>They are as children but one step below,</li>

  <li>The liquid drops of tears that you have shed</li>
  <li class="number">Shall come again, transform’d to orient pearl,</li>
  <li>Advantaging their loan with interest</li>
  <li>Of ten times double gain of happiness.</li>
  <li>Go, then my mother, to thy daughter go</li>
  <li>Make bold her bashful years with your experience;</li>
  <li class="number">Prepare her ears to hear a wooer’s tale</li>
  <li>Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame</li>

  <li>More than I have said, loving countrymen,</li>
  <li class="number">The leisure and enforcement of the time</li>

  <li>God and our good cause fight upon our side;</li>
  <li>The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,</li>
  <li>Like high-rear’d bulwarks, stand before our faces;</li>
  <li class="number">Richard except, those whom we fight against</li>
  <li>Had rather have us win than him they follow:</li>
  <li>For what is he they follow?  truly, gentlemen,</li>
  <li>A bloody tyrant and a homicide;</li>
  <li>One raised in blood, and one in blood establish’d;</li>
  <li class="number">One that made means to come by what he hath,</li>
  <li>And slaughter’d those that were the means to help him;</li>
  <li>Abase foul stone, made precious by the foil</li>
  <li>Of England’s chair, where he is falsely set;</li>
  <li>One that hath ever been God’s enemy:</li>
  <li class="number">Then, if you fight against God’s enemy,</li>
  <li>God will in justice ward you as his soldiers;</li>
  <li>If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,</li>
  <li>You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;</li>
  <li>If you do fight against your country’s foes,</li>
  <li class="number">Your country’s fat shall pay your pains the hire;</li>
  <li>If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,</li>
  <li>Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors;</li>
  <li>If you do free your children from the sword,</li>
  <li>Your children’s children quit it in your age.</li>
  <li class="number">Then, in the name of God and all these rights,</li>
  <li>Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.</li>
  <li>For me, the ransom of my bold attempt</li>
  <li>Shall be this cold corpse on the earth’s cold face;</li>
  <li>But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt</li>
  <li class="number">The least of you shall share his part thereof.</li>
