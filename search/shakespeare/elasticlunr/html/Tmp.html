<h3>SCENE I.  On a ship at sea: a tempestuous noise of thunder and lightning heard.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter a Master and a Boatswain</div>

<ol data-speaker="Master">
  <li>Boatswain!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Boatswain">
  <li>Here, master: what cheer?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Master">
  <li>Good, speak to the mariners: fall to’t, yarely,</li>
  <li>or we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter Mariners</div>

<ol data-speaker="Boatswain">
  <li class="number">Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!</li>
  <li>yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the</li>
  <li>master’s whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind,</li>
  <li>if room enough!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, FERDINAND,
GONZALO, and others</div>

<ol data-speaker="ALONSO">
  <li>Good boatswain, have care. Where’s the master?</li>
  <li class="number">Play the men.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Boatswain">
  <li>I pray now, keep below.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>Where is the master, boatswain?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Boatswain">
  <li>Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your</li>
  <li>cabins: you do assist the storm.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GONZALO">
  <li class="number">Nay, good, be patient.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Boatswain">
  <li>When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers</li>
  <li>for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GONZALO">
  <li>Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Boatswain">
  <li>None that I more love than myself. You are a</li>
  <li class="number">counsellor; if you can command these elements to</li>
  <li>silence, and work the peace of the present, we will</li>
  <li>not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you</li>
  <li>cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make</li>
  <li>yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of</li>
  <li class="number">the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good hearts! Out</li>
  <li>of our way, I say.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<ol data-speaker="GONZALO">
  <li>I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he</li>
  <li>hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is</li>
  <li>perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his</li>
  <li class="number">hanging: make the rope of his destiny our cable,</li>
  <li>for our own doth little advantage. If he be not</li>
  <li>born to be hanged, our case is miserable.</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt</div>

<ol data-speaker="Boatswain">
  <li>Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring</li>
  <li>her to try with main-course.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">A cry within</li>
  <li class="number">A plague upon this howling! they are louder than</li>
  <li>the weather or our office.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Re-enter SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, and GONZALO</li>
  <li>Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give o’er</li>
  <li>and drown? Have you a mind to sink?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li>A pox o’ your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,</li>

  <li>Work you then.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker!</li>
  <li>We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GONZALO">
  <li>I’ll warrant him for drowning; though the ship were</li>
  <li class="number">no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an</li>
  <li>unstanched wench.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Boatswain">
  <li>Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off to</li>
  <li>sea again; lay her off.</li>

  <li>All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!</li>

  <li class="number">What, must our mouths be cold?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GONZALO">
  <li>The king and prince at prayers! let’s assist them,</li>
  <li>For our case is as theirs.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li>I’m out of patience.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:</li>
  <li class="number">This wide-chapp’d rascal — would thou mightst lie drowning</li>
  <li>The washing of ten tides!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GONZALO">
  <li>He’ll be hang’d yet,</li>
  <li>Though every drop of water swear against it</li>
  <li>And gape at widest to glut him.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">A confused noise within:   ’Mercy on us!’ —

children!’ — 
’Farewell, brother!’ — ’We split, we split, we split!’</div>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li class="number">Let’s all sink with the king.</li>

  <li>Let’s take leave of him.</li>

  <li>Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  The island. Before PROSPERO’S cell.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter PROSPERO and MIRANDA</div>

<ol data-speaker="MIRANDA">
  <li>If by your art, my dearest father, you have</li>
  <li>Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.</li>
  <li>The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,</li>
  <li>But that the sea, mounting to the welkin’s cheek,</li>
  <li class="number">Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered</li>
  <li>With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,</li>
  <li>Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,</li>
  <li>Dash’d all to pieces. O, the cry did knock</li>
  <li>Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish’d.</li>
  <li class="number">Had I been any god of power, I would</li>
  <li>Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere</li>
  <li>It should the good ship so have swallow’d and</li>
  <li>The fraughting souls within her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROSPERO">
  <li>Be collected:</li>
  <li class="number">No more amazement: tell your piteous heart</li>
  <li>There’s no harm done.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MIRANDA">
  <li>O, woe the day!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROSPERO">
  <li>No harm.</li>
  <li>I have done nothing but in care of thee,</li>
  <li class="number">Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who</li>
  <li>Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing</li>
  <li>Of whence I am, nor that I am more better</li>
  <li>Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,</li>
  <li>And thy no greater father.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MIRANDA">
  <li class="number">More to know</li>
  <li>Did never meddle with my thoughts.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROSPERO">
  <li>’Tis time</li>
  <li>I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,</li>
  <li>And pluck my magic garment from me. So:</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Lays down his mantle</li>
  <li class="number">Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.</li>
  <li>The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch’d</li>
  <li>The very virtue of compassion in thee,</li>
  <li>I have with such provision in mine art</li>
  <li>So safely ordered that there is no soul — </li>
  <li class="number">No, not so much perdition as an hair</li>
  <li>Betid to any creature in the vessel</li>
  <li>Which thou heard’st cry, which thou saw’st sink. Sit down;</li>
  <li>For thou must now know farther.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MIRANDA">
  <li>You have often</li>
  <li class="number">Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp’d</li>
  <li>And left me to a bootless inquisition,</li>
  <li>Concluding ’Stay: not yet.’</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROSPERO">
  <li>The hour’s now come;</li>
  <li>The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;</li>
  <li class="number">Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember</li>
  <li>A time before we came unto this cell?</li>
  <li>I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not</li>
  <li>Out three years old.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MIRANDA">
  <li>Certainly, sir, I can.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROSPERO">
  <li class="number">By what? by any other house or person?</li>
  <li>Of any thing the image tell me that</li>
  <li>Hath kept with thy remembrance.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MIRANDA">
  <li>’Tis far off</li>
  <li>And rather like a dream than an assurance</li>
  <li class="number">That my remembrance warrants. Had I not</li>
  <li>Four or five women once that tended me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROSPERO">
  <li>Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it</li>
  <li>That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else</li>
  <li>In the dark backward and abysm of time?</li>
  <li class="number">If thou remember’st aught ere thou camest here,</li>
  <li>How thou camest here thou mayst.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MIRANDA">
  <li>But that I do not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROSPERO">
  <li>Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,</li>
  <li>Thy father was the Duke of Milan and</li>
  <li class="number">A prince of power.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MIRANDA">
  <li>Sir, are not you my father?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROSPERO">
  <li>Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and</li>
  <li>She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father</li>
  <li>Was Duke of Milan; and thou his only heir</li>
  <li class="number">And princess no worse issued.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MIRANDA">
  <li>O the heavens!</li>
  <li>What foul play had we, that we came from thence?</li>
  <li>Or blessed was’t we did?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROSPERO">
  <li>Both, both, my girl:</li>
  <li class="number">By foul play, as thou say’st, were we heaved thence,</li>
  <li>But blessedly holp hither.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MIRANDA">
  <li>O, my heart bleeds</li>
  <li>To think o’ the teen that I have turn’d you to,</li>
  <li>Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROSPERO">
  <li class="number">My brother and thy uncle, call’d Antonio — </li>
  <li>I pray thee, mark me — that a brother should</li>
  <li>Be so perfidious! — he whom next thyself</li>
  <li>Of all the world I loved and to him put</li>
  <li>The manage of my state; as at that time</li>
  <li class="number">Through all the signories it was the first</li>
  <li>And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed</li>
  <li>In dignity, and for the liberal arts</li>
  <li>Without a parallel; those being all my study,</li>
  <li>The government I cast upon my brother</li>
  <li class="number">And to my state grew stranger, being transported</li>
  <li>And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle — </li>
  <li>Dost thou attend me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MIRANDA">
  <li>Sir, most heedfully.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROSPERO">
  <li>Being once perfected how to grant suits,</li>
  <li class="number">How to deny them, who to advance and who</li>
  <li>To trash for over-topping, new created</li>
  <li>The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed ’em,</li>
  <li>Or else new form’d ’em; having both the key</li>
  <li>Of officer and office, set all hearts i’ the state</li>
  <li class="number">To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was</li>
  <li>The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,</li>
  <li>And suck’d my verdure out on’t. Thou attend’st not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MIRANDA">
  <li>O, good sir, I do.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROSPERO">
  <li>I pray thee, mark me.</li>
  <li class="number">I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated</li>
  <li>To closeness and the bettering of my mind</li>
  <li>With that which, but by being so retired,</li>
  <li>O’er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother</li>
  <li>Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,</li>
  <li class="number">Like a good parent, did beget of him</li>
  <li>A falsehood in its contrary as great</li>
  <li>As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,</li>
  <li>A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,</li>
  <li>Not only with what my revenue yielded,</li>
  <li class="number">But what my power might else exact, like one</li>
  <li>Who having into truth, by telling of it,</li>
  <li>Made such a sinner of his memory,</li>
  <li>To credit his own lie, he did believe</li>
  <li>He was indeed the duke; out o’ the substitution</li>
  <li class="number">And executing the outward face of royalty,</li>
  <li>With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing — </li>
  <li>Dost thou hear?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MIRANDA">
  <li>Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROSPERO">
  <li>To have no screen between this part he play’d</li>
  <li class="number">And him he play’d it for, he needs will be</li>
  <li>Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library</li>
  <li>Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties</li>
  <li>He thinks me now incapable; confederates — </li>
  <li>So dry he was for sway — wi’ the King of Naples</li>
  <li class="number">To give him annual tribute, do him homage,</li>
  <li>Subject his coronet to his crown and bend</li>
  <li>The dukedom yet unbow’d — alas, poor Milan! — </li>
  <li>To most ignoble stooping.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MIRANDA">
  <li>O the heavens!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROSPERO">
  <li class="number">Mark his condition and the event; then tell me</li>
  <li>If this might be a brother.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MIRANDA">
  <li>I should sin</li>
  <li>To think but nobly of my grandmother:</li>
  <li>Good wombs have borne bad sons.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROSPERO">
  <li class="number">Now the condition.</li>
  <li>The King of Naples, being an enemy</li>
  <li>To me inveterate, hearkens my brother’s suit;</li>
  <li>Which was, that he, in lieu o’ the premises</li>
  <li>Of homage and I know not how much tribute,</li>
  <li class="number">Should presently extirpate me and mine</li>
  <li>Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan</li>
  <li>With all the honours on my brother: whereon,</li>
  <li>A treacherous army levied, one midnight</li>
  <li>Fated to the purpose did Antonio open</li>
  <li class="number">The gates of Milan, and, i’ the dead of darkness,</li>
  <li>The ministers for the purpose hurried thence</li>
  <li>Me and thy crying self.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MIRANDA">
  <li>Alack, for pity!</li>
  <li>I, not remembering how I cried out then,</li>
  <li class="number">Will cry it o’er again: it is a hint</li>
  <li>That wrings mine eyes to’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROSPERO">
  <li>Hear a little further</li>
  <li>And then I’ll bring thee to the present business</li>
  <li>Which now’s upon’s; without the which this story</li>
  <li class="number">Were most impertinent.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MIRANDA">
  <li>Wherefore did they not</li>
  <li>That hour destroy us?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROSPERO">
  <li>Well demanded, wench:</li>
  <li>My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,</li>
  <li class="number">So dear the love my people bore me, nor set</li>
  <li>A mark so bloody on the business, but</li>
  <li>With colours fairer painted their foul ends.</li>
  <li>In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,</li>
  <li>Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared</li>
  <li class="number">A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg’d,</li>
  <li>Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats</li>
  <li>Instinctively had quit it: there they hoist us,</li>
  <li>To cry to the sea that roar’d to us, to sigh</li>
  <li>To the winds whose pity, sighing back again,</li>
  <li class="number">Did us but loving wrong.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MIRANDA">
  <li>Alack, what trouble</li>
  <li>Was I then to you!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROSPERO">
  <li>O, a cherubim</li>
  <li>Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile.</li>
  <li class="number">Infused with a fortitude from heaven,</li>
  <li>When I have deck’d the sea with drops full salt,</li>
  <li>Under my burthen groan’d; which raised in me</li>
  <li>An undergoing stomach, to bear up</li>
  <li>Against what should ensue.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MIRANDA">
  <li class="number">How came we ashore?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROSPERO">
  <li>By Providence divine.</li>
  <li>Some food we had and some fresh water that</li>
  <li>A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,</li>
  <li>Out of his charity, being then appointed</li>
  <li class="number">Master of this design, did give us, with</li>
  <li>Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,</li>
  <li>Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,</li>
  <li>Knowing I loved my books, he furnish’d me</li>
  <li>From mine own library with volumes that</li>
  <li class="number">I prize above my dukedom.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MIRANDA">
  <li>Would I might</li>
  <li>But ever see that man!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROSPERO">
  <li>Now I arise:</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Resumes his mantle</li>
  <li>Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.</li>
  <li class="number">Here in this island we arrived; and here</li>
  <li>Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit</li>
  <li>Than other princesses can that have more time</li>
  <li>For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MIRANDA">
  <li>Heavens thank you for’t! And now, I pray you, sir,</li>
  <li class="number">For still ’tis beating in my mind, your reason</li>
  <li>For raising this sea-storm?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROSPERO">
  <li>Know thus far forth.</li>
  <li>By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,</li>
  <li>Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies</li>
  <li class="number">Brought to this shore; and by my prescience</li>
  <li>I find my zenith doth depend upon</li>
  <li>A most auspicious star, whose influence</li>
  <li>If now I court not but omit, my fortunes</li>
  <li>Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions:</li>
  <li class="number">Thou art inclined to sleep; ’tis a good dulness,</li>
  <li>And give it way: I know thou canst not choose.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">MIRANDA sleeps</li>
  <li>Come away, servant, come. I am ready now.</li>
  <li>Approach, my Ariel, come.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter ARIEL</div>

<ol data-speaker="ARIEL">
  <li>All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come</li>
  <li class="number">To answer thy best pleasure; be’t to fly,</li>
  <li>To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride</li>
  <li>On the curl’d clouds, to thy strong bidding task</li>
  <li>Ariel and all his quality.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROSPERO">
  <li>Hast thou, spirit,</li>
  <li class="number">Perform’d to point the tempest that I bade thee?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARIEL">
  <li>To every article.</li>
  <li>I boarded the king’s ship; now on the beak,</li>
  <li>Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,</li>
  <li>I flamed amazement: sometime I’ld divide,</li>
  <li class="number">And burn in many places; on the topmast,</li>
  <li>The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,</li>
  <li>Then meet and join. Jove’s lightnings, the precursors</li>
  <li>O’ the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary</li>
  <li>And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks</li>
  <li class="number">Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune</li>
  <li>Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,</li>
  <li>Yea, his dread trident shake.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROSPERO">
  <li>My brave spirit!</li>
  <li>Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil</li>
  <li class="number">Would not infect his reason?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARIEL">
  <li>Not a soul</li>
  <li>But felt a fever of the mad and play’d</li>
  <li>Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners</li>
  <li>Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,</li>
  <li class="number">Then all afire with me: the king’s son, Ferdinand,</li>
  <li>With hair up-staring — then like reeds, not hair — </li>
  <li>Was the first man that leap’d; cried, ’Hell is empty</li>
  <li>And all the devils are here.’</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROSPERO">
  <li>Why that’s my spirit!</li>
  <li class="number">But was not this nigh shore?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARIEL">
  <li>Close by, my master.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROSPERO">
  <li>But are they, Ariel, safe?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARIEL">
  <li>Not a hair perish’d;</li>
  <li>On their sustaining garments not a blemish,</li>
  <li class="number">But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me,</li>
  <li>In troops I have dispersed them ’bout the isle.</li>
  <li>The king’s son have I landed by himself;</li>
  <li>Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs</li>
  <li>In an odd angle of the isle and sitting,</li>
  <li class="number">His arms in this sad knot.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROSPERO">
  <li>Of the king’s ship</li>
  <li>The mariners say how thou hast disposed</li>
  <li>And all the rest o’ the fleet.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARIEL">
  <li>Safely in harbour</li>
  <li class="number">Is the king’s ship; in the deep nook, where once</li>
  <li>Thou call’dst me up at midnight to fetch dew</li>
  <li>From the still-vex’d Bermoothes, there she’s hid:</li>
  <li>The mariners all under hatches stow’d;</li>
  <li>Who, with a charm join’d to their suffer’d labour,</li>
  <li class="number">I have left asleep; and for the rest o’ the fleet</li>
  <li>Which I dispersed, they all have met again</li>
  <li>And are upon the Mediterranean flote,</li>
  <li>Bound sadly home for Naples,</li>
  <li>Supposing that they saw the king’s ship wreck’d</li>
  <li class="number">And his great person perish.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROSPERO">
  <li>Ariel, thy charge</li>
  <li>Exactly is perform’d: but there’s more work.</li>
  <li>What is the time o’ the day?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARIEL">
  <li>Past the mid season.</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARIEL">
  <li>Ay, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROSPERO">
  <li>This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child</li>

  <li>A dozen years; within which space she died</li>
  <li>And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans</li>
  <li>As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island — </li>

  <li>Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban</li>

  <li>What torment I did find thee in; thy groans</li>
  <li>Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts</li>
  <li>Of ever angry bears: it was a torment</li>
  <li>To lay upon the damn’d, which Sycorax</li>

  <li class="number">I prithee, spare.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GONZALO">
  <li>Well, I have done: but yet — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li>He will be talking.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>Which, of he or Adrian, for a good</li>
  <li>wager, first begins to crow?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li class="number">The old cock.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>The cockerel.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li>Done. The wager?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>A laughter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li>A match!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ADRIAN">
  <li class="number">Though this island seem to be desert — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li>Ha, ha, ha! So, you’re paid.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ADRIAN">
  <li>Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li>Yet — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ADRIAN">
  <li>Yet — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li class="number">He could not miss’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ADRIAN">
  <li>It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate</li>
  <li>temperance.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>Temperance was a delicate wench.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li>Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ADRIAN">
  <li class="number">The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li>As if it had lungs and rotten ones.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>Or as ’twere perfumed by a fen.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GONZALO">
  <li>Here is everything advantageous to life.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>True; save means to live.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li class="number">Of that there’s none, or little.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GONZALO">
  <li>How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>The ground indeed is tawny.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li>With an eye of green in’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>He misses not much.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li class="number">No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GONZALO">
  <li>But the rarity of it is — which is indeed almost</li>
  <li>beyond credit — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li>As many vouched rarities are.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GONZALO">
  <li>That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in</li>
  <li class="number">the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and</li>
  <li>glosses, being rather new-dyed than stained with</li>
  <li>salt water.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not</li>
  <li>say he lies?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li class="number">Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GONZALO">
  <li>Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we</li>
  <li>put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of</li>
  <li>the king’s fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li>’Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ADRIAN">
  <li class="number">Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to</li>
  <li>their queen.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GONZALO">
  <li>Not since widow Dido’s time.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>Widow! a pox o’ that! How came that widow in?</li>
  <li>widow Dido!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li class="number">What if he had said ’widower AEneas’ too? Good Lord,</li>
  <li>how you take it!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ADRIAN">
  <li>’Widow Dido’ said you? you make me study of that:</li>
  <li>she was of Carthage, not of Tunis.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GONZALO">
  <li>This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ADRIAN">
  <li class="number">Carthage?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GONZALO">
  <li>I assure you, Carthage.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li>His word is more than the miraculous harp; he hath</li>
  <li>raised the wall and houses too.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>What impossible matter will he make easy next?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li class="number">I think he will carry this island home in his pocket</li>
  <li>and give it his son for an apple.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring</li>
  <li>forth more islands.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GONZALO">
  <li>Ay.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li class="number">Why, in good time.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GONZALO">
  <li>Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now</li>
  <li>as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage</li>
  <li>of your daughter, who is now queen.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>And the rarest that e’er came there.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li class="number">Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GONZALO">
  <li>Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I</li>
  <li>wore it? I mean, in a sort.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>That sort was well fished for.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GONZALO">
  <li class="number">When I wore it at your daughter’s marriage?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALONSO">
  <li>You cram these words into mine ears against</li>
  <li>The stomach of my sense. Would I had never</li>
  <li>Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,</li>
  <li>My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,</li>
  <li class="number">Who is so far from Italy removed</li>
  <li>I ne’er again shall see her. O thou mine heir</li>
  <li>Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish</li>
  <li>Hath made his meal on thee?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FRANCISCO">
  <li>Sir, he may live:</li>
  <li class="number">I saw him beat the surges under him,</li>
  <li>And ride upon their backs; he trod the water,</li>
  <li>Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted</li>
  <li>The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head</li>
  <li>’Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar’d</li>
  <li class="number">Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke</li>
  <li>To the shore, that o’er his wave-worn basis bow’d,</li>
  <li>As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt</li>
  <li>He came alive to land.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALONSO">
  <li>No, no, he’s gone.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li class="number">Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,</li>
  <li>That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,</li>
  <li>But rather lose her to an African;</li>
  <li>Where she at least is banish’d from your eye,</li>
  <li>Who hath cause to wet the grief on’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALONSO">
  <li class="number">Prithee, peace.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li>You were kneel’d to and importuned otherwise</li>
  <li>By all of us, and the fair soul herself</li>
  <li>Weigh’d between loathness and obedience, at</li>
  <li>Which end o’ the beam should bow. We have lost your</li>
  <li class="number">son,</li>
  <li>I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have</li>
  <li>More widows in them of this business’ making</li>
  <li>Than we bring men to comfort them:</li>
  <li>The fault’s your own.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALONSO">
  <li class="number">So is the dear’st o’ the loss.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GONZALO">
  <li>My lord Sebastian,</li>
  <li>The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness</li>
  <li>And time to speak it in: you rub the sore,</li>
  <li>When you should bring the plaster.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li class="number">Very well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>And most chirurgeonly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GONZALO">
  <li>It is foul weather in us all, good sir,</li>
  <li>When you are cloudy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li>Foul weather?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li class="number">Very foul.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GONZALO">
  <li>Had I plantation of this isle, my lord — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>He’ld sow’t with nettle-seed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li>Or docks, or mallows.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GONZALO">
  <li>And were the king on’t, what would I do?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li class="number">’Scape being drunk for want of wine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GONZALO">
  <li>I’ the commonwealth I would by contraries</li>
  <li>Execute all things; for no kind of traffic</li>
  <li>Would I admit; no name of magistrate;</li>
  <li>Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,</li>
  <li class="number">And use of service, none; contract, succession,</li>
  <li>Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;</li>
  <li>No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;</li>
  <li>No occupation; all men idle, all;</li>
  <li>And women too, but innocent and pure;</li>
  <li class="number">No sovereignty; — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li>Yet he would be king on’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the</li>
  <li>beginning.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GONZALO">
  <li>All things in common nature should produce</li>
  <li class="number">Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,</li>
  <li>Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,</li>
  <li>Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,</li>
  <li>Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,</li>
  <li>To feed my innocent people.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li class="number">No marrying ’mong his subjects?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>None, man; all idle: whores and knaves.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GONZALO">
  <li>I would with such perfection govern, sir,</li>
  <li>To excel the golden age.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li>God save his majesty!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li class="number">Long live Gonzalo!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GONZALO">
  <li>And — do you mark me, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALONSO">
  <li>Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GONZALO">
  <li>I do well believe your highness; and</li>
  <li>did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen,</li>
  <li class="number">who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that</li>
  <li>they always use to laugh at nothing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>’Twas you we laughed at.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GONZALO">
  <li>Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing</li>
  <li>to you: so you may continue and laugh at</li>
  <li class="number">nothing still.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>What a blow was there given!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li>An it had not fallen flat-long.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GONZALO">
  <li>You are gentlemen of brave metal; you would lift</li>
  <li>the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue</li>
  <li class="number">in it five weeks without changing.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter ARIEL, invisible, playing solemn music</div>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li>We would so, and then go a bat-fowling.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>Nay, good my lord, be not angry.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GONZALO">
  <li>No, I warrant you; I will not adventure</li>
  <li>my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh</li>
  <li class="number">me asleep, for I am very heavy?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>Go sleep, and hear us.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">All sleep except ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIO</div>

<ol data-speaker="ALONSO">
  <li>What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes</li>
  <li>Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find</li>
  <li>They are inclined to do so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li class="number">Please you, sir,</li>
  <li>Do not omit the heavy offer of it:</li>
  <li>It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,</li>
  <li>It is a comforter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>We two, my lord,</li>
  <li class="number">Will guard your person while you take your rest,</li>
  <li>And watch your safety.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALONSO">
  <li>Thank you. Wondrous heavy.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">ALONSO sleeps. Exit ARIEL</div>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li>What a strange drowsiness possesses them!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>It is the quality o’ the climate.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li class="number">Why</li>
  <li>Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not</li>
  <li>Myself disposed to sleep.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>Nor I; my spirits are nimble.</li>
  <li>They fell together all, as by consent;</li>
  <li class="number">They dropp’d, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,</li>
  <li>Worthy Sebastian? O, what might? — No more: — </li>
  <li>And yet me thinks I see it in thy face,</li>
  <li>What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and</li>
  <li>My strong imagination sees a crown</li>
  <li class="number">Dropping upon thy head.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li>What, art thou waking?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>Do you not hear me speak?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li>I do; and surely</li>
  <li>It is a sleepy language and thou speak’st</li>
  <li class="number">Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?</li>
  <li>This is a strange repose, to be asleep</li>
  <li>With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,</li>
  <li>And yet so fast asleep.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>Noble Sebastian,</li>
  <li class="number">Thou let’st thy fortune sleep — die, rather; wink’st</li>
  <li>Whiles thou art waking.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li>Thou dost snore distinctly;</li>
  <li>There’s meaning in thy snores.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>I am more serious than my custom: you</li>
  <li class="number">Must be so too, if heed me; which to do</li>
  <li>Trebles thee o’er.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li>Well, I am standing water.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>I’ll teach you how to flow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li>Do so: to ebb</li>
  <li class="number">Hereditary sloth instructs me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>O,</li>
  <li>If you but knew how you the purpose cherish</li>
  <li>Whiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,</li>
  <li>You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,</li>
  <li class="number">Most often do so near the bottom run</li>
  <li>By their own fear or sloth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li>Prithee, say on:</li>
  <li>The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim</li>
  <li>A matter from thee, and a birth indeed</li>
  <li class="number">Which throes thee much to yield.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>Thus, sir:</li>
  <li>Although this lord of weak remembrance, this,</li>
  <li>Who shall be of as little memory</li>
  <li>When he is earth’d, hath here almost persuade — </li>
  <li class="number">For he’s a spirit of persuasion, only</li>
  <li>Professes to persuade — the king his son’s alive,</li>
  <li>’Tis as impossible that he’s undrown’d</li>
  <li>And he that sleeps here swims.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li>I have no hope</li>
  <li class="number">That he’s undrown’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>O, out of that ’no hope’</li>
  <li>What great hope have you! no hope that way is</li>
  <li>Another way so high a hope that even</li>
  <li>Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,</li>
  <li class="number">But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me</li>
  <li>That Ferdinand is drown’d?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li>He’s gone.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>Then, tell me,</li>
  <li>Who’s the next heir of Naples?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li class="number">Claribel.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>She that is queen of Tunis; she that dwells</li>
  <li>Ten leagues beyond man’s life; she that from Naples</li>
  <li>Can have no note, unless the sun were post — </li>
  <li>The man i’ the moon’s too slow — till new-born chins</li>
  <li class="number">Be rough and razorable; she that — from whom?</li>
  <li>We all were sea-swallow’d, though some cast again,</li>
  <li>And by that destiny to perform an act</li>
  <li>Whereof what’s past is prologue, what to come</li>
  <li>In yours and my discharge.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li class="number">What stuff is this! how say you?</li>
  <li>’Tis true, my brother’s daughter’s queen of Tunis;</li>
  <li>So is she heir of Naples; ’twixt which regions</li>
  <li>There is some space.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>A space whose every cubit</li>
  <li class="number">Seems to cry out, ’How shall that Claribel</li>
  <li>Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,</li>
  <li>And let Sebastian wake.’ Say, this were death</li>
  <li>That now hath seized them; why, they were no worse</li>
  <li>Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples</li>
  <li class="number">As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate</li>
  <li>As amply and unnecessarily</li>
  <li>As this Gonzalo; I myself could make</li>
  <li>A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore</li>
  <li>The mind that I do! what a sleep were this</li>
  <li class="number">For your advancement! Do you understand me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li>Methinks I do.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>And how does your content</li>
  <li>Tender your own good fortune?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li>I remember</li>
  <li class="number">You did supplant your brother Prospero.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>True:</li>
  <li>And look how well my garments sit upon me;</li>
  <li>Much feater than before: my brother’s servants</li>
  <li>Were then my fellows; now they are my men.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li class="number">But, for your conscience?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>Ay, sir; where lies that? if ’twere a kibe,</li>
  <li>’Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel not</li>
  <li>This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences,</li>
  <li>That stand ’twixt me and Milan, candied be they</li>
  <li class="number">And melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,</li>
  <li>No better than the earth he lies upon,</li>
  <li>If he were that which now he’s like, that’s dead;</li>
  <li>Whom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it,</li>
  <li>Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,</li>
  <li class="number">To the perpetual wink for aye might put</li>
  <li>This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who</li>
  <li>Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest,</li>
  <li>They’ll take suggestion as a cat laps milk;</li>
  <li>They’ll tell the clock to any business that</li>
  <li class="number">We say befits the hour.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li>Thy case, dear friend,</li>
  <li>Shall be my precedent; as thou got’st Milan,</li>
  <li>I’ll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one stroke</li>
  <li>Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest;</li>
  <li class="number">And I the king shall love thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTONIO">
  <li>Draw together;</li>
  <li>And when I rear my hand, do you the like,</li>
  <li>To fall it on Gonzalo.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEBASTIAN">
  <li>O, but one word.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">They talk apart</div>

<ol data-speaker="ARIEL">

<h3>SCENE II.  Another part of the island.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter CALIBAN with a burden of wood. A noise of
thunder heard</div>

<ol data-speaker="CALIBAN">
  <li>All the infections that the sun sucks up</li>
  <li>From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him</li>
  <li>By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me</li>
  <li>And yet I needs must curse. But they’ll nor pinch,</li>
  <li class="number">Fright me with urchin — shows, pitch me i’ the mire,</li>
  <li>Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark</li>
  <li>Out of my way, unless he bid ’em; but</li>
  <li>For every trifle are they set upon me;</li>
  <li>Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me</li>
  <li class="number">And after bite me, then like hedgehogs which</li>
  <li>Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount</li>
  <li>Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I</li>
  <li>All wound with adders who with cloven tongues</li>
  <li>Do hiss me into madness.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter TRINCULO</li>
  <li class="number">Lo, now, lo!</li>
  <li>Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me</li>
  <li>For bringing wood in slowly. I’ll fall flat;</li>
  <li>Perchance he will not mind me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRINCULO">
  <li>Here’s neither bush nor shrub, to bear off</li>
  <li class="number">any weather at all, and another storm brewing;</li>
  <li>I hear it sing i’ the wind: yond same black</li>
  <li>cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul</li>
  <li>bombard that would shed his liquor. If it</li>
  <li>should thunder as it did before, I know not</li>
  <li class="number">where to hide my head: yond same cloud cannot</li>
  <li>choose but fall by pailfuls. What have we</li>
  <li>here? a man or a fish? dead or alive? A fish:</li>
  <li>he smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-</li>
  <li>like smell; a kind of not of the newest Poor-</li>
  <li class="number">John. A strange fish! Were I in England now,</li>
  <li>as once I was, and had but this fish painted,</li>
  <li>not a holiday fool there but would give a piece</li>
  <li>of silver: there would this monster make a</li>
  <li>man; any strange beast there makes a man:</li>
  <li class="number">when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame</li>
  <li>beggar, they will lazy out ten to see a dead</li>
  <li>Indian. Legged like a man and his fins like</li>
  <li>arms! Warm o’ my troth! I do now let loose</li>
  <li>my opinion; hold it no longer: this is no fish,</li>
  <li class="number">but an islander, that hath lately suffered by a</li>
  <li>thunderbolt.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Thunder</li>
  <li>Alas, the storm is come again! my best way is to</li>
  <li>creep under his gaberdine; there is no other</li>

  <li class="number">strange bed-fellows. I will here shroud till the</li>

<ol data-speaker="STEPHANO">
  <li class="number">This is some monster of the isle with four legs, who</li>

  <li class="number">fit. If I can recover him and keep him tame, I will</li>
  <li>not take too much for him; he shall pay for him that</li>

  <li class="number">I should know that voice: it should be — but he is</li>
  <li>drowned; and these are devils: O defend me!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="STEPHANO">
  <li>Four legs and two voices: a most delicate monster!</li>
  <li>His forward voice now is to speak well of his</li>
  <li>friend; his backward voice is to utter foul speeches</li>
  <li class="number">and to detract. If all the wine in my bottle will</li>
  <li>recover him, I will help his ague. Come. Amen! I</li>
  <li>will pour some in thy other mouth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRINCULO">
  <li>Stephano!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="STEPHANO">

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRINCULO">
  <li>Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me and</li>

  <li class="number">If thou beest Trinculo, come forth: I’ll pull thee</li>

<ol data-speaker="TRINCULO">
  <li class="number">I took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke. But</li>

  <li>There be some sports are painful, and their labour</li>

  <li>I am your wife, it you will marry me;</li>
  <li>If not, I’ll die your maid: to be your fellow</li>

  <li>You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from — </li>

  <li>Behold, sir king,</li>
  <li>The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero:</li>
  <li>For more assurance that a living prince</li>
  <li class="number">Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body;</li>
  <li>And to thee and thy company I bid</li>
  <li>A hearty welcome.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALONSO">
  <li>Whether thou best he or no,</li>
  <li>Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me,</li>
  <li class="number">As late I have been, I not know: thy pulse</li>
  <li>Beats as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee,</li>
  <li>The affliction of my mind amends, with which,</li>
  <li>I fear, a madness held me: this must crave,</li>
  <li>An if this be at all, a most strange story.</li>
  <li class="number">Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat</li>
  <li>Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero</li>
  <li>Be living and be here?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROSPERO">
  <li>First, noble friend,</li>
  <li>Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot</li>
  <li class="number">Be measured or confined.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GONZALO">
  <li>Whether this be</li>
  <li>Or be not, I’ll not swear.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROSPERO">
  <li>You do yet taste</li>
  <li>Some subtilties o’ the isle, that will not let you</li>
  <li class="number">Believe things certain. Welcome, my friends all!</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Aside to SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO</li>
  <li>But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded,</li>
  <li>I here could pluck his highness’ frown upon you</li>

  <li class="number"><span class="stage-direction">Aside</span>  The devil speaks in him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROSPERO">
  <li>No.</li>
  <li>For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother</li>
  <li>Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive</li>
  <li>Thy rankest fault; all of them; and require</li>
  <li class="number">My dukedom of thee, which perforce, I know,</li>
  <li>Thou must restore.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALONSO">
  <li>If thou be’st Prospero,</li>
  <li>Give us particulars of thy preservation;</li>
  <li>How thou hast met us here, who three hours since</li>

  <li>How sharp the point of this remembrance is! — </li>
  <li>My dear son Ferdinand.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROSPERO">
  <li>I am woe for’t, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALONSO">
  <li>Irreparable is the loss, and patience</li>
  <li class="number">Says it is past her cure.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROSPERO">
  <li>I rather think</li>
  <li>You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace</li>
  <li>For the like loss I have her sovereign aid</li>
  <li>And rest myself content.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALONSO">
  <li class="number">You the like loss!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROSPERO">
  <li>As great to me as late; and, supportable</li>
  <li>To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker</li>
  <li>Than you may call to comfort you, for I</li>
  <li>Have lost my daughter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALONSO">
  <li class="number">A daughter?</li>
  <li>O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,</li>
  <li>The king and queen there! that they were, I wish</li>
  <li>Myself were mudded in that oozy bed</li>
  <li>Where my son lies. When did you lose your daughter?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROSPERO">
  <li class="number">In this last tempest. I perceive these lords</li>
  <li>At this encounter do so much admire</li>
  <li>That they devour their reason and scarce think</li>
  <li>Their eyes do offices of truth, their words</li>
  <li>Are natural breath: but, howsoe’er you have</li>
  <li class="number">Been justled from your senses, know for certain</li>
  <li>That I am Prospero and that very duke</li>
  <li>Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely</li>
  <li>Upon this shore, where you were wreck’d, was landed,</li>
  <li>To be the lord on’t. No more yet of this;</li>
  <li class="number">For ’tis a chronicle of day by day,</li>
  <li>Not a relation for a breakfast nor</li>
  <li>Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir;</li>
  <li>This cell’s my court: here have I few attendants</li>
  <li>And subjects none abroad: pray you, look in.</li>
  <li class="number">My dukedom since you have given me again,</li>
  <li>I will requite you with as good a thing;</li>
  <li>At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye</li>
  <li>As much as me my dukedom.</li>

  <li class="number">No, my dear’st love,</li>
  <li>I would not for the world.</li>

  <li>Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,</li>

  <li>A most high miracle!</li>

  <li>O, wonder!</li>

  <li class="number">How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world,</li>
  <li>That has such people in’t!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROSPERO">
  <li>’Tis new to thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALONSO">
  <li>What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?</li>
  <li>Your eld’st acquaintance cannot be three hours:</li>
  <li class="number">Is she the goddess that hath sever’d us,</li>
  <li>And brought us thus together?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FERDINAND">
  <li>Sir, she is mortal;</li>
  <li>But by immortal Providence she’s mine:</li>
  <li>I chose her when I could not ask my father</li>
  <li class="number">For his advice, nor thought I had one. She</li>
  <li>Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,</li>
  <li>Of whom so often I have heard renown,</li>

  <li>Received a second life; and second father</li>
  <li class="number">This lady makes him to me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALONSO">
  <li>I am hers:</li>
  <li>But, O, how oddly will it sound that I</li>
  <li>Must ask my child forgiveness!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROSPERO">
  <li>There, sir, stop:</li>
  <li class="number">Let us not burthen our remembrance with</li>
  <li>A heaviness that’s gone.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GONZALO">
  <li>I have inly wept,</li>

  <li>I say, Amen, Gonzalo!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GONZALO">
  <li>Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue</li>
  <li>Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice</li>
  <li class="number">Beyond a common joy, and set it down</li>
  <li>With gold on lasting pillars: In one voyage</li>
  <li>Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,</li>
  <li>And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife</li>
  <li>Where he himself was lost, Prospero his dukedom</li>

  <li class="stage-direction">Re-enter ARIEL, with the Master and Boatswain
amazedly following</li>
  <li>O, look, sir, look, sir! here is more of us:</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALONSO">
  <li>These are not natural events; they strengthen</li>
  <li class="number">From strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Boatswain">
  <li>If I did think, sir, I were well awake,</li>
  <li>I’ld strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,</li>

  <li>Where but even now with strange and several noises</li>
  <li class="number">Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,</li>
  <li>And more diversity of sounds, all horrible,</li>
  <li>We were awaked; straightway, at liberty;</li>
  <li>Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld</li>
  <li>Our royal, good and gallant ship, our master</li>
  <li class="number">Capering to eye her: on a trice, so please you,</li>
  <li>Even in a dream, were we divided from them</li>
  <li>And were brought moping hither.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARIEL">
  <li><stagedir>Aside to PROSPERO</stagedir>          Was’t well done?</li>

<ol data-speaker="PROSPERO">
  <li><stagedir>Aside to ARIEL</stagedir>  Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ALONSO">
  <li class="number">This is as strange a maze as e’er men trod</li>
  <li>And there is in this business more than nature</li>
  <li>Was ever conduct of: some oracle</li>
  <li>Must rectify our knowledge.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROSPERO">
  <li>Sir, my liege,</li>
  <li class="number">Do not infest your mind with beating on</li>
  <li>The strangeness of this business; at pick’d leisure</li>
  <li>Which shall be shortly, single I’ll resolve you,</li>

  <li>These happen’d accidents; till when, be cheerful</li>
  <li class="number">And think of each thing well.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Aside to ARIEL</li>
  <li>Come hither, spirit:</li>
  <li>Set Caliban and his companions free;</li>
  <li>Untie the spell.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exit ARIEL</li>
  <li>How fares my gracious sir?</li>
  <li class="number">There are yet missing of your company</li>
  <li>Some few odd lads that you remember not.</li>

  <li>That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,</li>
  <li>And deal in her command without her power.</li>
  <li class="number">These three have robb’d me; and this demi-devil — </li>
  <li>For he’s a bastard one — had plotted with them</li>
  <li>To take my life. Two of these fellows you</li>

<ol data-speaker="ALONSO">
  <li>And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they</li>

  <li class="number">How camest thou in this pickle?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRINCULO">
  <li>I have been in such a pickle since I</li>

  <li>Ay, that I will; and I’ll be wise hereafter</li>
