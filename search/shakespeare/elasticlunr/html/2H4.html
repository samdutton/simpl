<h3>SCENE I.  The same.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter LORD BARDOLPH</div>

<ol data-speaker="LORD BARDOLPH">
  <li>Who keeps the gate here, ho?</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">The Porter opens the gate</li>
  <li>Where is the earl?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Porter">
  <li>What shall I say you are?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD BARDOLPH">
  <li>Tell thou the earl</li>
  <li class="number">That the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Porter">
  <li>His lordship is walk’d forth into the orchard;</li>
  <li>Please it your honour, knock but at the gate,</li>
  <li>And he himself wilt answer.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter NORTHUMBERLAND</div>

<ol data-speaker="LORD BARDOLPH">
  <li>Here comes the earl.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit Porter</div>

<ol data-speaker="NORTHUMBERLAND">
  <li class="number">What news, Lord Bardolph? every minute now</li>
  <li>Should be the father of some stratagem:</li>
  <li>The times are wild: contention, like a horse</li>
  <li>Full of high feeding, madly hath broke loose</li>
  <li>And bears down all before him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD BARDOLPH">
  <li class="number">Noble earl,</li>
  <li>I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTHUMBERLAND">
  <li>Good, an God will!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD BARDOLPH">
  <li>As good as heart can wish:</li>
  <li>The king is almost wounded to the death;</li>
  <li class="number">And, in the fortune of my lord your son,</li>
  <li>Prince Harry slain outright; and both the Blunts</li>
  <li>Kill’d by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John</li>
  <li>And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field;</li>
  <li>And Harry Monmouth’s brawn, the hulk Sir John,</li>
  <li class="number">Is prisoner to your son: O, such a day,</li>
  <li>So fought, so follow’d and so fairly won,</li>
  <li>Came not till now to dignify the times,</li>
  <li>Since Caesar’s fortunes!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTHUMBERLAND">
  <li>How is this derived?</li>
  <li class="number">Saw you the field? came you from Shrewsbury?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD BARDOLPH">
  <li>I spake with one, my lord, that came from thence,</li>
  <li>A gentleman well bred and of good name,</li>
  <li>That freely render’d me these news for true.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTHUMBERLAND">
  <li>Here comes my servant Travers, whom I sent</li>
  <li class="number">On Tuesday last to listen after news.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter TRAVERS</div>

<ol data-speaker="LORD BARDOLPH">
  <li>My lord, I over-rode him on the way;</li>
  <li>And he is furnish’d with no certainties</li>
  <li>More than he haply may retail from me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTHUMBERLAND">
  <li>Now, Travers, what good tidings comes with you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRAVERS">
  <li class="number">My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turn’d me back</li>
  <li>With joyful tidings; and, being better horsed,</li>
  <li>Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard</li>
  <li>A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,</li>
  <li>That stopp’d by me to breathe his bloodied horse.</li>
  <li class="number">He ask’d the way to Chester; and of him</li>
  <li>I did demand what news from Shrewsbury:</li>
  <li>He told me that rebellion had bad luck</li>
  <li>And that young Harry Percy’s spur was cold.</li>
  <li>With that, he gave his able horse the head,</li>
  <li class="number">And bending forward struck his armed heels</li>
  <li>Against the panting sides of his poor jade</li>
  <li>Up to the rowel-head, and starting so</li>
  <li>He seem’d in running to devour the way,</li>
  <li>Staying no longer question.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTHUMBERLAND">
  <li class="number">Ha! Again:</li>
  <li>Said he young Harry Percy’s spur was cold?</li>
  <li>Of Hotspur Coldspur? that rebellion</li>
  <li>Had met ill luck?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD BARDOLPH">
  <li>My lord, I’ll tell you what;</li>
  <li class="number">If my young lord your son have not the day,</li>
  <li>Upon mine honour, for a silken point</li>
  <li>I’ll give my barony: never talk of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTHUMBERLAND">
  <li>Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers</li>
  <li>Give then such instances of loss?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD BARDOLPH">
  <li class="number">Who, he?</li>
  <li>He was some hilding fellow that had stolen</li>
  <li>The horse he rode on, and, upon my life,</li>
  <li>Spoke at a venture. Look, here comes more news.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter MORTON</div>

<ol data-speaker="NORTHUMBERLAND">
  <li>Yea, this man’s brow, like to a title-leaf,</li>
  <li class="number">Foretells the nature of a tragic volume:</li>
  <li>So looks the strand whereon the imperious flood</li>
  <li>Hath left a witness’d usurpation.</li>
  <li>Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MORTON">
  <li>I ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord;</li>
  <li class="number">Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask</li>
  <li>To fright our party.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTHUMBERLAND">
  <li>How doth my son and brother?</li>
  <li>Thou tremblest; and the whiteness in thy cheek</li>
  <li>Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand.</li>
  <li class="number">Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,</li>
  <li>So dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone,</li>
  <li>Drew Priam’s curtain in the dead of night,</li>
  <li>And would have told him half his Troy was burnt;</li>
  <li>But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue,</li>
  <li class="number">And I my Percy’s death ere thou report’st it.</li>
  <li>This thou wouldst say, ’Your son did thus and thus;</li>
  <li>Your brother thus: so fought the noble Douglas:’</li>
  <li>Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds:</li>
  <li>But in the end, to stop my ear indeed,</li>
  <li class="number">Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise,</li>
  <li>Ending with ’Brother, son, and all are dead.’</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MORTON">
  <li>Douglas is living, and your brother, yet;</li>
  <li>But, for my lord your son — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTHUMBERLAND">
  <li>Why, he is dead.</li>
  <li class="number">See what a ready tongue suspicion hath!</li>
  <li>He that but fears the thing he would not know</li>
  <li>Hath by instinct knowledge from others’ eyes</li>
  <li>That what he fear’d is chanced. Yet speak, Morton;</li>
  <li>Tell thou an earl his divination lies,</li>
  <li class="number">And I will take it as a sweet disgrace</li>
  <li>And make thee rich for doing me such wrong.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MORTON">
  <li>You are too great to be by me gainsaid:</li>
  <li>Your spirit is too true, your fears too certain.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTHUMBERLAND">
  <li>Yet, for all this, say not that Percy’s dead.</li>
  <li class="number">I see a strange confession in thine eye:</li>
  <li>Thou shakest thy head and hold’st it fear or sin</li>
  <li>To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so;</li>
  <li>The tongue offends not that reports his death:</li>
  <li>And he doth sin that doth belie the dead,</li>
  <li class="number">Not he which says the dead is not alive.</li>
  <li>Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news</li>
  <li>Hath but a losing office, and his tongue</li>
  <li>Sounds ever after as a sullen bell,</li>
  <li>Remember’d tolling a departing friend.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD BARDOLPH">
  <li class="number">I cannot think, my lord, your son is dead.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MORTON">
  <li>I am sorry I should force you to believe</li>
  <li>That which I would to God I had not seen;</li>
  <li>But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state,</li>
  <li>Rendering faint quittance, wearied and out-breathed,</li>
  <li class="number">To Harry Monmouth; whose swift wrath beat down</li>
  <li>The never-daunted Percy to the earth,</li>
  <li>From whence with life he never more sprung up.</li>
  <li>In few, his death, whose spirit lent a fire</li>
  <li>Even to the dullest peasant in his camp,</li>
  <li class="number">Being bruited once, took fire and heat away</li>
  <li>From the best temper’d courage in his troops;</li>
  <li>For from his metal was his party steel’d;</li>
  <li>Which once in him abated, all the rest</li>
  <li>Turn’d on themselves, like dull and heavy lead:</li>
  <li class="number">And as the thing that’s heavy in itself,</li>
  <li>Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,</li>
  <li>So did our men, heavy in Hotspur’s loss,</li>
  <li>Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear</li>
  <li>That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim</li>
  <li class="number">Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,</li>
  <li>Fly from the field. Then was the noble Worcester</li>
  <li>Too soon ta’en prisoner; and that furious Scot,</li>
  <li>The bloody Douglas, whose well-labouring sword</li>
  <li>Had three times slain the appearance of the king,</li>
  <li class="number">’Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame</li>
  <li>Of those that turn’d their backs, and in his flight,</li>
  <li>Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all</li>
  <li>Is that the king hath won, and hath sent out</li>
  <li>A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,</li>
  <li class="number">Under the conduct of young Lancaster</li>
  <li>And Westmoreland. This is the news at full.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTHUMBERLAND">
  <li>For this I shall have time enough to mourn.</li>
  <li>In poison there is physic; and these news,</li>
  <li>Having been well, that would have made me sick,</li>
  <li class="number">Being sick, have in some measure made me well:</li>
  <li>And as the wretch, whose fever-weaken’d joints,</li>
  <li>Like strengthless hinges, buckle under life,</li>
  <li>Impatient of his fit, breaks like a fire</li>
  <li>Out of his keeper’s arms, even so my limbs,</li>
  <li class="number">Weaken’d with grief, being now enraged with grief,</li>
  <li>Are thrice themselves. Hence, therefore, thou nice crutch!</li>
  <li>A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel</li>
  <li>Must glove this hand: and hence, thou sickly quoif!</li>
  <li>Thou art a guard too wanton for the head</li>
  <li class="number">Which princes, flesh’d with conquest, aim to hit.</li>
  <li>Now bind my brows with iron; and approach</li>
  <li>The ragged’st hour that time and spite dare bring</li>
  <li>To frown upon the enraged Northumberland!</li>
  <li>Let heaven kiss earth! now let not Nature’s hand</li>
  <li class="number">Keep the wild flood confined! let order die!</li>
  <li>And let this world no longer be a stage</li>
  <li>To feed contention in a lingering act;</li>
  <li>But let one spirit of the first-born Cain</li>
  <li>Reign in all bosoms, that, each heart being set</li>
  <li class="number">On bloody courses, the rude scene may end,</li>
  <li>And darkness be the burier of the dead!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRAVERS">
  <li>This strained passion doth you wrong, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD BARDOLPH">
  <li>Sweet earl, divorce not wisdom from your honour.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MORTON">
  <li>The lives of all your loving complices</li>
  <li class="number">Lean on your health; the which, if you give o’er</li>
  <li>To stormy passion, must perforce decay.</li>
  <li>You cast the event of war, my noble lord,</li>
  <li>And summ’d the account of chance, before you said</li>
  <li>’Let us make head.’ It was your presurmise,</li>
  <li class="number">That, in the dole of blows, your son might drop:</li>
  <li>You knew he walk’d o’er perils, on an edge,</li>
  <li>More likely to fall in than to get o’er;</li>
  <li>You were advised his flesh was capable</li>
  <li>Of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit</li>
  <li class="number">Would lift him where most trade of danger ranged:</li>
  <li>Yet did you say ’Go forth;’ and none of this,</li>
  <li>Though strongly apprehended, could restrain</li>
  <li>The stiff-borne action: what hath then befallen,</li>
  <li>Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth,</li>
  <li class="number">More than that being which was like to be?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD BARDOLPH">
  <li>We all that are engaged to this loss</li>
  <li>Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas</li>
  <li>That if we wrought our life ’twas ten to one;</li>
  <li>And yet we ventured, for the gain proposed</li>
  <li class="number">Choked the respect of likely peril fear’d;</li>
  <li>And since we are o’erset, venture again.</li>
  <li>Come, we will all put forth, body and goods.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MORTON">
  <li>’Tis more than time: and, my most noble lord,</li>
  <li>I hear for certain, and do speak the truth,</li>
  <li class="number">The gentle Archbishop of York is up</li>
  <li>With well-appointed powers: he is a man</li>
  <li>Who with a double surety binds his followers.</li>
  <li>My lord your son had only but the corpse,</li>
  <li>But shadows and the shows of men, to fight;</li>
  <li class="number">For that same word, rebellion, did divide</li>
  <li>The action of their bodies from their souls;</li>
  <li>And they did fight with queasiness, constrain’d,</li>
  <li>As men drink potions, that their weapons only</li>
  <li>Seem’d on our side; but, for their spirits and souls,</li>
  <li class="number">This word, rebellion, it had froze them up,</li>
  <li>As fish are in a pond. But now the bishop</li>
  <li>Turns insurrection to religion:</li>
  <li>Supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts,</li>
  <li>He’s followed both with body and with mind;</li>
  <li class="number">And doth enlarge his rising with the blood</li>
  <li>Of fair King Richard, scraped from Pomfret stones;</li>
  <li>Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause;</li>
  <li>Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land,</li>
  <li>Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke;</li>
  <li class="number">And more and less do flock to follow him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTHUMBERLAND">
  <li>I knew of this before; but, to speak truth,</li>
  <li>This present grief had wiped it from my mind.</li>
  <li>Go in with me; and counsel every man</li>
  <li>The aptest way for safety and revenge:</li>
  <li class="number">Get posts and letters, and make friends with speed:</li>
  <li>Never so few, and never yet more need.</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  London. A street.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter FALSTAFF, with his Page bearing his sword
and buckler</div>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Sirrah, you giant, what says the doctor to my water?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Page">
  <li>He said, sir, the water itself was a good healthy</li>
  <li>water; but, for the party that owed it, he might</li>
  <li>have more diseases than he knew for.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li class="number">Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me: the</li>
  <li>brain of this foolish-compounded clay, man, is not</li>
  <li>able to invent anything that tends to laughter, more</li>
  <li>than I invent or is invented on me: I am not only</li>
  <li>witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other</li>
  <li class="number">men. I do here walk before thee like a sow that</li>
  <li>hath overwhelmed all her litter but one. If the</li>
  <li>prince put thee into my service for any other reason</li>
  <li>than to set me off, why then I have no judgment.</li>
  <li>Thou whoreson mandrake, thou art fitter to be worn</li>
  <li class="number">in my cap than to wait at my heels. I was never</li>
  <li>manned with an agate till now: but I will inset you</li>
  <li>neither in gold nor silver, but in vile apparel, and</li>
  <li>send you back again to your master, for a jewel — </li>
  <li>the juvenal, the prince your master, whose chin is</li>
  <li class="number">not yet fledged. I will sooner have a beard grow in</li>
  <li>the palm of my hand than he shall get one on his</li>
  <li>cheek; and yet he will not stick to say his face is</li>
  <li>a face-royal: God may finish it when he will, ’tis</li>
  <li>not a hair amiss yet: he may keep it still at a</li>
  <li class="number">face-royal, for a barber shall never earn sixpence</li>
  <li>out of it; and yet he’ll be crowing as if he had</li>
  <li>writ man ever since his father was a bachelor. He</li>
  <li>may keep his own grace, but he’s almost out of mine,</li>
  <li>I can assure him. What said Master Dombledon about</li>
  <li class="number">the satin for my short cloak and my slops?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Page">
  <li>He said, sir, you should procure him better</li>
  <li>assurance than Bardolph: he would not take his</li>
  <li>band and yours; he liked not the security.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Let him be damned, like the glutton! pray God his</li>
  <li class="number">tongue be hotter! A whoreson Achitophel! a rascally</li>
  <li>yea-forsooth knave! to bear a gentleman in hand,</li>
  <li>and then stand upon security! The whoreson</li>
  <li>smooth-pates do now wear nothing but high shoes, and</li>
  <li>bunches of keys at their girdles; and if a man is</li>
  <li class="number">through with them in honest taking up, then they</li>
  <li>must stand upon security. I had as lief they would</li>
  <li>put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with</li>
  <li>security. I looked a’ should have sent me two and</li>
  <li>twenty yards of satin, as I am a true knight, and he</li>
  <li class="number">sends me security. Well, he may sleep in security;</li>
  <li>for he hath the horn of abundance, and the lightness</li>
  <li>of his wife shines through it: and yet cannot he</li>
  <li>see, though he have his own lanthorn to light him.</li>
  <li>Where’s Bardolph?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Page">
  <li class="number">He’s gone into Smithfield to buy your worship a horse.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>I bought him in Paul’s, and he’ll buy me a horse in</li>
  <li>Smithfield: an I could get me but a wife in the</li>
  <li>stews, I were manned, horsed, and wived.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter the Lord Chief-Justice and Servant</div>

<ol data-speaker="Page">
  <li>Sir, here comes the nobleman that committed the</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Wait, close; I will not see him.</li>
</ol>

  <li>What’s he that goes there?</li>

  <li class="number">He, my lord: but he hath since done good service at</li>

  <li>Sir John!</li>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li class="number">What! a young knave, and begging! Is there not</li>

  <li>lack subjects? do not the rebels need soldiers?</li>
  <li>Though it be a shame to be on any side but one, it</li>
  <li>is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side,</li>

  <li>how to make it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Servant">
  <li>You mistake me, sir.</li>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Why, sir, did I say you were an honest man? setting</li>

  <li>I pray you, sir, then set your knighthood and our</li>
  <li>soldiership aside; and give me leave to tell you,</li>
  <li>you lie in your throat, if you say I am any other</li>
  <li>than an honest man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li class="number">I give thee leave to tell me so! I lay aside that</li>
  <li>which grows to me! if thou gettest any leave of me,</li>
  <li>hang me; if thou takest leave, thou wert better be</li>
  <li>hanged. You hunt counter: hence! avaunt!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Servant">
  <li>Sir, my lord would speak with you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Lord Chief-Justice">
  <li class="number">Sir John Falstaff, a word with you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>My good lord! God give your lordship good time of</li>
  <li>day. I am glad to see your lordship abroad: I heard</li>
  <li>say your lordship was sick: I hope your lordship</li>
  <li>goes abroad by advice. Your lordship, though not</li>
  <li class="number">clean past your youth, hath yet some smack of age in</li>
  <li>you, some relish of the saltness of time; and I must</li>
  <li>humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverent care</li>
  <li>of your health.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Lord Chief-Justice">
  <li>Sir John, I sent for you before your expedition to</li>
  <li class="number">Shrewsbury.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>An’t please your lordship, I hear his majesty is</li>
  <li>returned with some discomfort from Wales.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Lord Chief-Justice">
  <li>I talk not of his majesty: you would not come when</li>
  <li>I sent for you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li class="number">And I hear, moreover, his highness is fallen into</li>
  <li>this same whoreson apoplexy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Lord Chief-Justice">
  <li>Well, God mend him! I pray you, let me speak with</li>
  <li>you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>This apoplexy is, as I take it, a kind of lethargy,</li>
  <li class="number">an’t please your lordship; a kind of sleeping in the</li>
  <li>blood, a whoreson tingling.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Lord Chief-Justice">
  <li>What tell you me of it? be it as it is.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>It hath its original from much grief, from study and</li>
  <li>perturbation of the brain: I have read the cause of</li>
  <li class="number">his effects in Galen: it is a kind of deafness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Lord Chief-Justice">
  <li>I think you are fallen into the disease; for you</li>
  <li>hear not what I say to you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Very well, my lord, very well: rather, an’t please</li>
  <li>you, it is the disease of not listening, the malady</li>
  <li class="number">of not marking, that I am troubled withal.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Lord Chief-Justice">
  <li>To punish you by the heels would amend the</li>
  <li>attention of your ears; and I care not if I do</li>
  <li>become your physician.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so patient:</li>
  <li class="number">your lordship may minister the potion of</li>
  <li>imprisonment to me in respect of poverty; but how</li>
  <li>should I be your patient to follow your</li>
  <li>prescriptions, the wise may make some dram of a</li>
  <li>scruple, or indeed a scruple itself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Lord Chief-Justice">
  <li class="number">I sent for you, when there were matters against you</li>
  <li>for your life, to come speak with me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>As I was then advised by my learned counsel in the</li>
  <li>laws of this land-service, I did not come.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Lord Chief-Justice">
  <li>Well, the truth is, Sir John, you live in great infamy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li class="number">He that buckles him in my belt cannot live in less.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Lord Chief-Justice">
  <li>Your means are very slender, and your waste is great.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>I would it were otherwise; I would my means were</li>
  <li>greater, and my waist slenderer.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Lord Chief-Justice">
  <li>You have misled the youthful prince.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li class="number">The young prince hath misled me: I am the fellow</li>
  <li>with the great belly, and he my dog.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Lord Chief-Justice">
  <li>Well, I am loath to gall a new-healed wound: your</li>
  <li>day’s service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded</li>
  <li>over your night’s exploit on Gad’s-hill: you may</li>
  <li class="number">thank the unquiet time for your quiet o’er-posting</li>
  <li>that action.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>My lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Lord Chief-Justice">
  <li>But since all is well, keep it so: wake not a</li>
  <li>sleeping wolf.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li class="number">To wake a wolf is as bad as to smell a fox.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Lord Chief-Justice">
  <li>What! you are as a candle, the better part burnt</li>
  <li>out.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>A wassail candle, my lord, all tallow: if I did say</li>
  <li>of wax, my growth would approve the truth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Lord Chief-Justice">
  <li class="number">There is not a white hair on your face but should</li>
  <li>have his effect of gravity.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>His effect of gravy, gravy, gravy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Lord Chief-Justice">
  <li>You follow the young prince up and down, like his</li>
  <li>ill angel.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li class="number">Not so, my lord; your ill angel is light; but I hope</li>
  <li>he that looks upon me will take me without weighing:</li>
  <li>and yet, in some respects, I grant, I cannot go: I</li>
  <li>cannot tell. Virtue is of so little regard in these</li>
  <li>costermonger times that true valour is turned</li>
  <li class="number">bear-herd: pregnancy is made a tapster, and hath</li>
  <li>his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings: all the</li>
  <li>other gifts appertinent to man, as the malice of</li>
  <li>this age shapes them, are not worth a gooseberry.</li>
  <li>You that are old consider not the capacities of us</li>
  <li class="number">that are young; you do measure the heat of our</li>
  <li>livers with the bitterness of your galls: and we</li>
  <li>that are in the vaward of our youth, I must confess,</li>
  <li>are wags too.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Lord Chief-Justice">
  <li>Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth,</li>
  <li class="number">that are written down old with all the characters of</li>
  <li>age? Have you not a moist eye? a dry hand? a</li>
  <li>yellow cheek? a white beard? a decreasing leg? an</li>
  <li>increasing belly? is not your voice broken? your</li>
  <li>wind short? your chin double? your wit single? and</li>
  <li class="number">every part about you blasted with antiquity? and</li>
  <li>will you yet call yourself young? Fie, fie, fie, Sir John!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>My lord, I was born about three of the clock in the</li>
  <li>afternoon, with a white head and something a round</li>
  <li>belly. For my voice, I have lost it with halloing</li>
  <li class="number">and singing of anthems. To approve my youth</li>
  <li>further, I will not: the truth is, I am only old in</li>
  <li>judgment and understanding; and he that will caper</li>
  <li>with me for a thousand marks, let him lend me the</li>
  <li>money, and have at him! For the box of the ear that</li>
  <li class="number">the prince gave you, he gave it like a rude prince,</li>
  <li>and you took it like a sensible lord. I have</li>
  <li>chequed him for it, and the young lion repents;</li>
  <li>marry, not in ashes and sackcloth, but in new silk</li>
  <li>and old sack.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Lord Chief-Justice">
  <li class="number">Well, God send the prince a better companion!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>God send the companion a better prince! I cannot</li>
  <li>rid my hands of him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Lord Chief-Justice">
  <li>Well, the king hath severed you and Prince Harry: I</li>
  <li>hear you are going with Lord John of Lancaster</li>
  <li class="number">against the Archbishop and the Earl of</li>
  <li>Northumberland.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Yea; I thank your pretty sweet wit for it. But look</li>
  <li>you pray, all you that kiss my lady Peace at home,</li>
  <li>that our armies join not in a hot day; for, by the</li>
  <li class="number">Lord, I take but two shirts out with me, and I mean</li>
  <li>not to sweat extraordinarily: if it be a hot day,</li>
  <li>and I brandish any thing but a bottle, I would I</li>
  <li>might never spit white again. There is not a</li>
  <li>dangerous action can peep out his head but I am</li>
  <li class="number">thrust upon it: well, I cannot last ever: but it</li>
  <li>was alway yet the trick of our English nation, if</li>
  <li>they have a good thing, to make it too common. If</li>
  <li>ye will needs say I am an old man, you should give</li>
  <li>me rest. I would to God my name were not so</li>
  <li class="number">terrible to the enemy as it is: I were better to be</li>
  <li>eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to</li>
  <li>nothing with perpetual motion.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Lord Chief-Justice">
  <li>Well, be honest, be honest; and God bless your</li>
  <li>expedition!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li class="number">Will your lordship lend me a thousand pound to</li>
  <li>furnish me forth?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Lord Chief-Justice">
  <li>Not a penny, not a penny; you are too impatient to</li>
  <li>bear crosses. Fare you well: commend me to my</li>
  <li>cousin Westmoreland.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt Chief-Justice and Servant</div>

  <li class="number">If I do, fillip me with a three-man beetle. A man</li>

<h3>SCENE III.  York. The Archbishop’s palace.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, the Lords HASTINGS,
MOWBRAY, and BARDOLPH</div>

<ol data-speaker="ARCHBISHOP OF YORK">
  <li>Thus have you heard our cause and known our means;</li>
  <li>And, my most noble friends, I pray you all,</li>
  <li>Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes:</li>
  <li>And first, lord marshal, what say you to it?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOWBRAY">
  <li class="number">I well allow the occasion of our arms;</li>
  <li>But gladly would be better satisfied</li>
  <li>How in our means we should advance ourselves</li>
  <li>To look with forehead bold and big enough</li>
  <li>Upon the power and puissance of the king.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HASTINGS">
  <li class="number">Our present musters grow upon the file</li>
  <li>To five and twenty thousand men of choice;</li>
  <li>And our supplies live largely in the hope</li>
  <li>Of great Northumberland, whose bosom burns</li>
  <li>With an incensed fire of injuries.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD BARDOLPH">
  <li class="number">The question then, Lord Hastings, standeth thus;</li>
  <li>Whether our present five and twenty thousand</li>
  <li>May hold up head without Northumberland?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HASTINGS">
  <li>With him, we may.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD BARDOLPH">
  <li>Yea, marry, there’s the point:</li>
  <li class="number">But if without him we be thought too feeble,</li>
  <li>My judgment is, we should not step too far</li>
  <li>Till we had his assistance by the hand;</li>
  <li>For in a theme so bloody-faced as this</li>
  <li>Conjecture, expectation, and surmise</li>
  <li class="number">Of aids incertain should not be admitted.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARCHBISHOP OF YORK">
  <li>’Tis very true, Lord Bardolph; for indeed</li>
  <li>It was young Hotspur’s case at Shrewsbury.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD BARDOLPH">
  <li>It was, my lord; who lined himself with hope,</li>
  <li>Eating the air on promise of supply,</li>
  <li class="number">Flattering himself in project of a power</li>
  <li>Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts:</li>
  <li>And so, with great imagination</li>
  <li>Proper to madmen, led his powers to death</li>
  <li>And winking leap’d into destruction.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HASTINGS">
  <li class="number">But, by your leave, it never yet did hurt</li>
  <li>To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD BARDOLPH">
  <li>Yes, if this present quality of war,</li>
  <li>Indeed the instant action: a cause on foot</li>
  <li>Lives so in hope as in an early spring</li>
  <li class="number">We see the appearing buds; which to prove fruit,</li>
  <li>Hope gives not so much warrant as despair</li>
  <li>That frosts will bite them. When we mean to build,</li>
  <li>We first survey the plot, then draw the model;</li>
  <li>And when we see the figure of the house,</li>
  <li class="number">Then must we rate the cost of the erection;</li>
  <li>Which if we find outweighs ability,</li>
  <li>What do we then but draw anew the model</li>
  <li>In fewer offices, or at last desist</li>
  <li>To build at all? Much more, in this great work,</li>
  <li class="number">Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down</li>
  <li>And set another up, should we survey</li>
  <li>The plot of situation and the model,</li>
  <li>Consent upon a sure foundation,</li>
  <li>Question surveyors, know our own estate,</li>
  <li class="number">How able such a work to undergo,</li>
  <li>To weigh against his opposite; or else</li>
  <li>We fortify in paper and in figures,</li>
  <li>Using the names of men instead of men:</li>
  <li>Like one that draws the model of a house</li>
  <li class="number">Beyond his power to build it; who, half through,</li>
  <li>Gives o’er and leaves his part-created cost</li>
  <li>A naked subject to the weeping clouds</li>
  <li>And waste for churlish winter’s tyranny.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HASTINGS">
  <li>Grant that our hopes, yet likely of fair birth,</li>
  <li class="number">Should be still-born, and that we now possess’d</li>
  <li>The utmost man of expectation,</li>
  <li>I think we are a body strong enough,</li>
  <li>Even as we are, to equal with the king.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD BARDOLPH">
  <li>What, is the king but five and twenty thousand?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HASTINGS">
  <li class="number">To us no more; nay, not so much, Lord Bardolph.</li>
  <li>For his divisions, as the times do brawl,</li>
  <li>Are in three heads: one power against the French,</li>
  <li>And one against Glendower; perforce a third</li>
  <li>Must take up us: so is the unfirm king</li>
  <li class="number">In three divided; and his coffers sound</li>
  <li>With hollow poverty and emptiness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARCHBISHOP OF YORK">
  <li>That he should draw his several strengths together</li>
  <li>And come against us in full puissance,</li>
  <li>Need not be dreaded.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HASTINGS">
  <li class="number">If he should do so,</li>
  <li>He leaves his back unarm’d, the French and Welsh</li>
  <li>Baying him at the heels: never fear that.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD BARDOLPH">
  <li>Who is it like should lead his forces hither?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HASTINGS">
  <li>The Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland;</li>
  <li class="number">Against the Welsh, himself and Harry Monmouth:</li>
  <li>But who is substituted ’gainst the French,</li>
  <li>I have no certain notice.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARCHBISHOP OF YORK">
  <li>Let us on,</li>
  <li>And publish the occasion of our arms.</li>
  <li class="number">The commonwealth is sick of their own choice;</li>
  <li>Their over-greedy love hath surfeited:</li>

  <li>O thou fond many, with what loud applause</li>
  <li class="number">Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke,</li>
  <li>Before he was what thou wouldst have him be!</li>
  <li>And being now trimm’d in thine own desires,</li>
  <li>Thou, beastly feeder, art so full of him,</li>
  <li>That thou provokest thyself to cast him up.</li>
  <li class="number">So, so, thou common dog, didst thou disgorge</li>
  <li>Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard;</li>
  <li>And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up,</li>
  <li>And howl’st to find it. What trust is in</li>
  <li>these times?</li>
  <li class="number">They that, when Richard lived, would have him die,</li>
  <li>Are now become enamour’d on his grave:</li>
  <li>Thou, that threw’st dust upon his goodly head</li>
  <li>When through proud London he came sighing on</li>
  <li>After the admired heels of Bolingbroke,</li>
  <li class="number">Criest now ’O earth, yield us that king again,</li>

<h3>SCENE I.  London. A street.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY, FANG and his Boy with her,
and SNARE following.

MISTRESS QUICKLY Master Fang, have you entered the action?

FANG It is entered.

MISTRESS QUICKLY Where’s your yeoman? Is’t a lusty yeoman? will a’
stand to ’t?

FANG Sirrah, where’s Snare?

MISTRESS QUICKLY O Lord, ay! good Master Snare.

SNARE Here, here.

FANG Snare, we must arrest Sir John Falstaff.

MISTRESS QUICKLY Yea, good Master Snare; I have entered him and all.

SNARE It may chance cost some of us our lives, for he will stab.

MISTRESS QUICKLY Alas the day! take heed of him; he stabbed me in
mine own house, and that most beastly: in good
faith, he cares not what mischief he does. If his
weapon be out: he will foin like any devil; he will
spare neither man, woman, nor child.

FANG If I can close with him, I care not for his thrust.

MISTRESS QUICKLY No, nor I neither: I’ll be at your elbow.

FANG An I but fist him once; an a’ come but within my vice — 

MISTRESS QUICKLY I am undone by his going; I warrant you, he’s an
infinitive thing upon my score. Good Master Fang,
hold him sure: good Master Snare, let him not
’scape. A’ comes continuantly to Pie-corner — saving
your manhoods — to buy a saddle; and he is indited to
dinner to the Lubber’s-head in Lumbert street, to
Master Smooth’s the silkman: I pray ye, since my
exion is entered and my case so openly known to the
world, let him be brought in to his answer. A
hundred mark is a long one for a poor lone woman to
bear: and I have borne, and borne, and borne, and
have been fubbed off, and fubbed off, and fubbed
off, from this day to that day, that it is a shame
to be thought on. There is no honesty in such
dealing; unless a woman should be made an ass and a
beast, to bear every knave’s wrong. Yonder he
comes; and that errant malmsey-nose knave, Bardolph,
with him. Do your offices, do your offices: Master
Fang and Master Snare, do me, do me, do me your offices.

</ol>

  <li>Marry, if thou wert an honest man, thyself and the</li>

  <li>parcel-gilt goblet, sitting in my Dolphin-chamber,</li>
  <li>at the round table, by a sea-coal fire, upon</li>
  <li>Wednesday in Wheeson week, when the prince broke</li>
  <li>thy head for liking his father to a singing-man of</li>
  <li class="number">Windsor, thou didst swear to me then, as I was</li>
  <li>washing thy wound, to marry me and make me my lady</li>
  <li>thy wife. Canst thou deny it? Did not goodwife</li>
  <li>Keech, the butcher’s wife, come in then and call me</li>
  <li>gossip Quickly? coming in to borrow a mess of</li>
  <li class="number">vinegar; telling us she had a good dish of prawns;</li>
  <li>whereby thou didst desire to eat some; whereby I</li>
  <li>told thee they were ill for a green wound? And</li>
  <li>didst thou not, when she was gone down stairs,</li>
  <li>desire me to be no more so familiarity with such</li>
  <li class="number">poor people; saying that ere long they should call</li>
  <li>me madam? And didst thou not kiss me and bid me</li>
  <li>fetch thee thirty shillings? I put thee now to thy</li>
  <li>book-oath: deny it, if thou canst.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>My lord, this is a poor mad soul; and she says up</li>
  <li class="number">and down the town that the eldest son is like you:</li>
  <li>she hath been in good case, and the truth is,</li>

<ol data-speaker="Lord Chief-Justice">
  <li>Sir John, Sir John, I am well acquainted with your</li>

  <li>is not a confident brow, nor the throng of words</li>
  <li>that come with such more than impudent sauciness</li>
  <li>from you, can thrust me from a level consideration:</li>
  <li>you have, as it appears to me, practised upon the</li>
  <li class="number">easy-yielding spirit of this woman, and made her</li>
  <li>serve your uses both in purse and in person.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS QUICKLY">
  <li>Yea, in truth, my lord.</li>
</ol>

  <li>current repentance.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>My lord, I will not undergo this sneap without</li>
  <li>reply. You call honourable boldness impudent</li>
  <li>sauciness: if a man will make courtesy and say</li>
  <li class="number">nothing, he is virtuous: no, my lord, my humble</li>
  <li>duty remembered, I will not be your suitor. I say</li>
  <li>to you, I do desire deliverance from these officers,</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  London. Another street.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS</div>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE HENRY">
  <li>Before God, I am exceeding weary.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POINS">
  <li>Is’t come to that? I had thought weariness durst not</li>
  <li>have attached one of so high blood.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE HENRY">
  <li>Faith, it does me; though it discolours the</li>
  <li class="number">complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it. Doth</li>
  <li>it not show vilely in me to desire small beer?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POINS">
  <li>Why, a prince should not be so loosely studied as</li>
  <li>to remember so weak a composition.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE HENRY">
  <li>Belike then my appetite was not princely got; for,</li>
  <li class="number">by my troth, I do now remember the poor creature,</li>
  <li>small beer. But, indeed, these humble</li>
  <li>considerations make me out of love with my</li>
  <li>greatness. What a disgrace is it to me to remember</li>
  <li>thy name! or to know thy face to-morrow! or to</li>
  <li class="number">take note how many pair of silk stockings thou</li>
  <li>hast, viz. these, and those that were thy</li>
  <li>peach-coloured ones! or to bear the inventory of thy</li>
  <li>shirts, as, one for superfluity, and another for</li>
  <li>use! But that the tennis-court-keeper knows better</li>
  <li class="number">than I; for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when</li>
  <li>thou keepest not racket there; as thou hast not done</li>
  <li>a great while, because the rest of thy low</li>
  <li>countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland:</li>
  <li>and God knows, whether those that bawl out the ruins</li>
  <li class="number">of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom: but the</li>
  <li>midwives say the children are not in the fault;</li>
  <li>whereupon the world increases, and kindreds are</li>
  <li>mightily strengthened.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POINS">
  <li>How ill it follows, after you have laboured so hard,</li>
  <li class="number">you should talk so idly! Tell me, how many good</li>
  <li>young princes would do so, their fathers being so</li>
  <li>sick as yours at this time is?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE HENRY">
  <li>Shall I tell thee one thing, Poins?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POINS">
  <li>Yes, faith; and let it be an excellent good thing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE HENRY">
  <li class="number">It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POINS">
  <li>Go to; I stand the push of your one thing that you</li>
  <li>will tell.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE HENRY">
  <li>Marry, I tell thee, it is not meet that I should be</li>
  <li>sad, now my father is sick: albeit I could tell</li>
  <li class="number">thee, as to one it pleases me, for fault of a</li>
  <li>better, to call my friend, I could be sad, and sad</li>
  <li>indeed too.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POINS">
  <li>Very hardly upon such a subject.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE HENRY">
  <li>By this hand thou thinkest me as far in the devil’s</li>
  <li class="number">book as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and</li>
  <li>persistency: let the end try the man. But I tell</li>
  <li>thee, my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so</li>
  <li>sick: and keeping such vile company as thou art</li>
  <li>hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POINS">
  <li class="number">The reason?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE HENRY">
  <li>What wouldst thou think of me, if I should weep?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POINS">
  <li>I would think thee a most princely hypocrite.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE HENRY">
  <li>It would be every man’s thought; and thou art a</li>
  <li>blessed fellow to think as every man thinks: never</li>
  <li class="number">a man’s thought in the world keeps the road-way</li>
  <li>better than thine: every man would think me an</li>
  <li>hypocrite indeed. And what accites your most</li>
  <li>worshipful thought to think so?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POINS">
  <li>Why, because you have been so lewd and so much</li>
  <li class="number">engraffed to Falstaff.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE HENRY">
  <li>And to thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POINS">
  <li>By this light, I am well spoke on; I can hear it</li>
  <li>with my own ears: the worst that they can say of</li>
  <li>me is that I am a second brother and that I am a</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY IV">
  <li>Go call the Earls of Surrey and of Warwick;</li>

  <li class="stage-direction">Exit Page</li>
  <li>How many thousand of my poorest subjects</li>

  <li>Why rather, sleep, liest thou in smoky cribs,</li>
  <li class="number">Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee</li>
  <li>And hush’d with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber,</li>
  <li>Than in the perfumed chambers of the great,</li>
  <li>Under the canopies of costly state,</li>
  <li>And lull’d with sound of sweetest melody?</li>
  <li class="number">O thou dull god, why liest thou with the vile</li>
  <li>In loathsome beds, and leavest the kingly couch</li>
  <li>A watch-case or a common ’larum-bell?</li>
  <li>Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast</li>
  <li>Seal up the ship-boy’s eyes, and rock his brains</li>
  <li class="number">In cradle of the rude imperious surge</li>
  <li>And in the visitation of the winds,</li>
  <li>Who take the ruffian billows by the top,</li>
  <li>Curling their monstrous heads and hanging them</li>
  <li>With deafening clamour in the slippery clouds,</li>
  <li class="number">That, with the hurly, death itself awakes?</li>

  <li>And in the calmest and most stillest night,</li>
  <li>With all appliances and means to boot,</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY IV">
  <li>Is it good morrow, lords?</li>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>’Tis one o’clock, and past.</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY IV">
  <li class="number">Why, then, good morrow to you all, my lords.</li>
  <li>Have you read o’er the letters that I sent you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>We have, my liege.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY IV">
  <li>Then you perceive the body of our kingdom</li>
  <li>How foul it is; what rank diseases grow</li>
  <li class="number">And with what danger, near the heart of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>It is but as a body yet distemper’d;</li>
  <li>Which to his former strength may be restored</li>
  <li>With good advice and little medicine:</li>
  <li>My Lord Northumberland will soon be cool’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY IV">
  <li class="number">O God! that one might read the book of fate,</li>
  <li>And see the revolution of the times</li>
  <li>Make mountains level, and the continent,</li>
  <li>Weary of solid firmness, melt itself</li>
  <li>Into the sea! and, other times, to see</li>
  <li class="number">The beachy girdle of the ocean</li>
  <li>Too wide for Neptune’s hips; how chances mock,</li>
  <li>And changes fill the cup of alteration</li>
  <li>With divers liquors! O, if this were seen,</li>
  <li>The happiest youth, viewing his progress through,</li>
  <li class="number">What perils past, what crosses to ensue,</li>
  <li>Would shut the book, and sit him down and die.</li>
  <li>’Tis not ’ten years gone</li>
  <li>Since Richard and Northumberland, great friends,</li>
  <li>Did feast together, and in two years after</li>
  <li class="number">Were they at wars: it is but eight years since</li>
  <li>This Percy was the man nearest my soul,</li>
  <li>Who like a brother toil’d in my affairs</li>
  <li>And laid his love and life under my foot,</li>
  <li>Yea, for my sake, even to the eyes of Richard</li>
  <li class="number">Gave him defiance. But which of you was by — </li>
  <li>You, cousin Nevil, as I may remember — </li>
  <li class="stage-direction">To WARWICK</li>
  <li>When Richard, with his eye brimful of tears,</li>
  <li>Then cheque’d and rated by Northumberland,</li>
  <li>Did speak these words, now proved a prophecy?</li>
  <li class="number">’Northumberland, thou ladder by the which</li>
  <li>My cousin Bolingbroke ascends my throne;’</li>
  <li>Though then, God knows, I had no such intent,</li>
  <li>But that necessity so bow’d the state</li>
  <li>That I and greatness were compell’d to kiss:</li>
  <li class="number">’The time shall come,’ thus did he follow it,</li>
  <li>’The time will come, that foul sin, gathering head,</li>
  <li>Shall break into corruption:’ so went on,</li>
  <li>Foretelling this same time’s condition</li>
  <li>And the division of our amity.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li class="number">There is a history in all men’s lives,</li>
  <li>Figuring the nature of the times deceased;</li>
  <li>The which observed, a man may prophesy,</li>
  <li>With a near aim, of the main chance of things</li>
  <li>As yet not come to life, which in their seeds</li>
  <li class="number">And weak beginnings lie intreasured.</li>
  <li>Such things become the hatch and brood of time;</li>
  <li>And by the necessary form of this</li>
  <li>King Richard might create a perfect guess</li>
  <li>That great Northumberland, then false to him,</li>
  <li class="number">Would of that seed grow to a greater falseness;</li>
  <li>Which should not find a ground to root upon,</li>
  <li>Unless on you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY IV">
  <li>Are these things then necessities?</li>
  <li>Then let us meet them like necessities:</li>
  <li class="number">And that same word even now cries out on us:</li>
  <li>They say the bishop and Northumberland</li>
  <li>Are fifty thousand strong.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>It cannot be, my lord;</li>
  <li>Rumour doth double, like the voice and echo,</li>
  <li class="number">The numbers of the fear’d. Please it your grace</li>
  <li>To go to bed. Upon my soul, my lord,</li>
  <li>The powers that you already have sent forth</li>
  <li>Shall bring this prize in very easily.</li>
  <li>To comfort you the more, I have received</li>
  <li class="number">A certain instance that Glendower is dead.</li>
  <li>Your majesty hath been this fortnight ill,</li>
  <li>And these unseason’d hours perforce must add</li>
  <li>Unto your sickness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY IV">

  <li>There was I, and little John Doit of Staffordshire,</li>

  <li>The same Sir John, the very same. I  see him break</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BARDOLPH">
  <li>Sir, pardon; a soldier is better accommodated than</li>
  <li>with a wife.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHALLOW">
  <li class="number">It is well said, in faith, sir; and it is well said</li>
  <li>indeed too. Better accommodated! it is good; yea,</li>
  <li>indeed, is it: good phrases are surely, and ever</li>
  <li>were, very commendable. Accommodated! it comes of</li>
  <li>’accommodo’ very good; a good phrase.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BARDOLPH">
  <li class="number">Pardon me, sir; I have heard the word. Phrase call</li>
  <li>you it? by this good day, I know not the phrase;</li>
  <li>but I will maintain the word with my sword to be a</li>
  <li>soldier-like word, and a word of exceeding good</li>
  <li>command, by heaven. Accommodated; that is, when a</li>
  <li class="number">man is, as they say, accommodated; or when a man is,</li>
  <li>being, whereby a’ may be thought to be accommodated;</li>
  <li>which is an excellent thing.</li>

<ol data-speaker="SHALLOW">
  <li>Marry, have we, sir. Will you sit?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Let me see them, I beseech you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHALLOW">
  <li>Where’s the roll? where’s the roll? where’s the</li>
  <li>roll? Let me see, let me see, let me see. So, so:</li>
  <li class="number">yea, marry, sir: Ralph Mouldy! Let them appear as</li>
  <li>I call; let them do so, let them do so. Let me</li>
  <li>see; where is Mouldy?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOULDY">
  <li>Here, an’t please you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHALLOW">
  <li>What think you, Sir John? a good-limbed fellow;</li>
  <li class="number">young, strong, and of good friends.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Is thy name Mouldy?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOULDY">
  <li>Yea, an’t please you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>’Tis the more time thou wert used.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHALLOW">
  <li>Ha, ha, ha! most excellent, i’ faith! Things that</li>
  <li class="number">are mouldy lack use: very singular good! in faith,</li>
  <li>well said, Sir John, very well said.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Prick him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOULDY">
  <li>I was pricked well enough before, an you could have</li>
  <li>let me alone: my old dame will be undone now for</li>
  <li class="number">one to do her husbandry and her drudgery: you need</li>
  <li>not to have pricked me; there are other men fitter</li>
  <li>to go out than I.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Go to: peace, Mouldy; you shall go. Mouldy, it is</li>
  <li>time you were spent.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOULDY">
  <li class="number">Spent!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHALLOW">
  <li>Peace, fellow, peace; stand aside: know you where</li>
  <li>you are? For the other, Sir John: let me see:</li>
  <li>Simon Shadow!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Yea, marry, let me have him to sit under: he’s like</li>
  <li class="number">to be a cold soldier.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHALLOW">
  <li>Where’s Shadow?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHADOW">
  <li>Here, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Shadow, whose son art thou?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHADOW">
  <li>My mother’s son, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li class="number">Thy mother’s son! like enough, and thy father’s</li>
  <li>shadow: so the son of the female is the shadow of</li>
  <li>the male: it is often so, indeed; but much of the</li>
  <li>father’s substance!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHALLOW">
  <li>Do you like him, Sir John?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li class="number">Shadow will serve for summer; prick him, for we have</li>
  <li>a number of shadows to fill up the muster-book.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHALLOW">
  <li>Thomas Wart!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Where’s he?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WART">
  <li>Here, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li class="number">Is thy name Wart?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WART">
  <li>Yea, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Thou art a very ragged wart.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHALLOW">
  <li>Shall I prick him down, Sir John?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>It were superfluous; for his apparel is built upon</li>
  <li class="number">his back and the whole frame stands upon pins:</li>
  <li>prick him no more.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHALLOW">
  <li>Ha, ha, ha! you can do it, sir; you can do it: I</li>
  <li>commend you well. Francis Feeble!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FEEBLE">
  <li>Here, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li class="number">What trade art thou, Feeble?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FEEBLE">
  <li>A woman’s tailor, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHALLOW">
  <li>Shall I prick him, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>You may: but if he had been a man’s tailor, he’ld</li>
  <li>ha’ pricked you. Wilt thou make as many holes in</li>
  <li class="number">an enemy’s battle as thou hast done in a woman’s petticoat?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FEEBLE">
  <li>I will do my good will, sir; you can have no more.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Well said, good woman’s tailor! well said,</li>
  <li>courageous Feeble! thou wilt be as valiant as the</li>
  <li>wrathful dove or most magnanimous mouse. Prick the</li>
  <li class="number">woman’s tailor: well, Master Shallow; deep, Master Shallow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FEEBLE">
  <li>I would Wart might have gone, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>I would thou wert a man’s tailor, that thou mightst</li>
  <li>mend him and make him fit to go. I cannot put him</li>
  <li>to a private soldier that is the leader of so many</li>
  <li class="number">thousands: let that suffice, most forcible Feeble.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FEEBLE">
  <li>It shall suffice, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>I am bound to thee, reverend Feeble. Who is next?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHALLOW">
  <li>Peter Bullcalf o’ the green!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Yea, marry, let’s see Bullcalf.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BULLCALF">
  <li class="number">Here, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>’Fore God, a likely fellow! Come, prick me Bullcalf</li>
  <li>till he roar again.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BULLCALF">
  <li>O Lord! good my lord captain — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>What, dost thou roar before thou art pricked?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BULLCALF">
  <li class="number">O Lord, sir! I am a diseased man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>What disease hast thou?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BULLCALF">
  <li>A whoreson cold, sir, a cough, sir, which I caught</li>
  <li>with ringing in the king’s affairs upon his</li>
  <li>coronation-day, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li class="number">Come, thou shalt go to the wars in a gown; we wilt</li>
  <li>have away thy cold; and I will take such order that</li>
  <li>my friends shall ring for thee. Is here all?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHALLOW">
  <li>Here is two more called than your number, you must</li>
  <li>have but four here, sir: and so, I pray you, go in</li>
  <li class="number">with me to dinner.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Come, I will go drink with you, but I cannot tarry</li>
  <li>dinner. I am glad to see you, by my troth, Master Shallow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHALLOW">
  <li>O, Sir John, do you remember since we lay all night</li>
  <li>in the windmill in Saint George’s field?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li class="number">No more of that, good Master Shallow, no more of that.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHALLOW">
  <li>Ha! ’twas a merry night. And is Jane Nightwork alive?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>She lives, Master Shallow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHALLOW">
  <li>She never could away with me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Never, never; she would always say she could not</li>
  <li class="number">abide Master Shallow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHALLOW">
  <li>By the mass, I could anger her to the heart. She</li>
  <li>was then a bona-roba. Doth she hold her own well?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FALSTAFF">
  <li>Old, old, Master Shallow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHALLOW">
  <li>Nay, she must be old; she cannot choose but be old;</li>
  <li class="number">certain she’s old; and had Robin Nightwork by old</li>
  <li>Nightwork before I came to Clement’s Inn.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SILENCE">
  <li>That’s fifty-five year ago.</li>

  <li>discharge you with the motion of a pewterer’s</li>
  <li class="number">hammer, come off and on swifter than he that gibbets</li>
  <li>on the brewer’s bucket. And this same half-faced</li>

  <li>level at the edge of a penknife. And for a retreat;</li>
  <li class="number">how swiftly will this Feeble the woman’s tailor run</li>
  <li>off! O, give me the spare men, and spare me the</li>

  <li>He is not his craft’s master; he doth not do it</li>

  <li>would manage you his piece thus; and a’ would about</li>

  <li class="number">tah, tah,’ would a’ say; ’bounce’ would a’ say; and</li>

  <li>As I return, I will fetch off these justices: I do</li>
  <li>see the bottom of Justice Shallow. Lord, Lord, how</li>
  <li>subject we old men are to this vice of lying! This</li>
  <li>same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to</li>
  <li class="number">me of the wildness of his youth, and the feats he</li>
  <li>hath done about Turnbull Street: and every third</li>
  <li>word a lie, duer paid to the hearer than the Turk’s</li>
  <li>tribute. I do remember him at Clement’s Inn like a</li>
  <li>man made after supper of a cheese-paring: when a’</li>
  <li class="number">was naked, he was, for all the world, like a forked</li>
  <li>radish, with a head fantastically carved upon it</li>
  <li>with a knife: a’ was so forlorn, that his</li>
  <li>dimensions to any thick sight were invincible: a’</li>
  <li>was the very genius of famine; yet lecherous as a</li>
  <li class="number">monkey, and the whores called him mandrake: a’ came</li>
  <li>ever in the rearward of the fashion, and sung those</li>
  <li>tunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard the</li>
  <li>carmen whistle, and swear they were his fancies or</li>
  <li>his good-nights. And now is this Vice’s dagger</li>
  <li class="number">become a squire, and talks as familiarly of John a</li>
  <li>Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him; and</li>
  <li>I’ll be sworn a’ ne’er saw him but once in the</li>
  <li>Tilt-yard; and then he burst his head for crowding</li>
  <li>among the marshal’s men. I saw it, and told John a</li>
  <li class="number">Gaunt he beat his own name; for you might have</li>
  <li>thrust him and all his apparel into an eel-skin; the</li>
  <li>case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him, a</li>
  <li>court: and now has he land and beefs. Well, I’ll</li>
  <li>be acquainted with him, if I return; and it shall</li>
  <li class="number">go hard but I will make him a philosopher’s two</li>
  <li>stones to me: if the young dace be a bait for the</li>
  <li>old pike, I see no reason in the law of nature but I</li>
  <li>may snap at him. Let time shape, and there an end.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ARCHBISHOP OF YORK">
  <li>’Tis well done.</li>
  <li>My friends and brethren in these great affairs,</li>
  <li>I must acquaint you that I have received</li>
  <li>New-dated letters from Northumberland;</li>

  <li>Here doth he wish his person, with such powers</li>
  <li>As might hold sortance with his quality,</li>
  <li>The which he could not levy; whereupon</li>
  <li>He is retired, to ripe his growing fortunes,</li>
  <li class="number">To Scotland: and concludes in hearty prayers</li>

  <li>West of this forest, scarcely off a mile,</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter WESTMORELAND</div>

<ol data-speaker="MOWBRAY">
  <li>I think it is my Lord of Westmoreland.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WESTMORELAND">
  <li>Health and fair greeting from our general,</li>
  <li class="number">The prince, Lord John and Duke of Lancaster.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARCHBISHOP OF YORK">
  <li>Say on, my Lord of Westmoreland, in peace:</li>
  <li>What doth concern your coming?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WESTMORELAND">
  <li>Then, my lord,</li>
  <li>Unto your grace do I in chief address</li>
  <li class="number">The substance of my speech. If that rebellion</li>
  <li>Came like itself, in base and abject routs,</li>
  <li>Led on by bloody youth, guarded with rags,</li>
  <li>And countenanced by boys and beggary,</li>
  <li>I say, if damn’d commotion so appear’d,</li>
  <li class="number">In his true, native and most proper shape,</li>
  <li>You, reverend father, and these noble lords</li>
  <li>Had not been here, to dress the ugly form</li>
  <li>Of base and bloody insurrection</li>
  <li>With your fair honours. You, lord archbishop,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose see is by a civil peace maintained,</li>
  <li>Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch’d,</li>
  <li>Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor’d,</li>
  <li>Whose white investments figure innocence,</li>
  <li>The dove and very blessed spirit of peace,</li>
  <li class="number">Wherefore do you so ill translate ourself</li>
  <li>Out of the speech of peace that bears such grace,</li>
  <li>Into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war;</li>
  <li>Turning your books to graves, your ink to blood,</li>
  <li>Your pens to lances and your tongue divine</li>
  <li class="number">To a trumpet and a point of war?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARCHBISHOP OF YORK">
  <li>Wherefore do I this? so the question stands.</li>
  <li>Briefly to this end: we are all diseased,</li>
  <li>And with our surfeiting and wanton hours</li>
  <li>Have brought ourselves into a burning fever,</li>
  <li class="number">And we must bleed for it; of which disease</li>
  <li>Our late king, Richard, being infected, died.</li>
  <li>But, my most noble Lord of Westmoreland,</li>
  <li>I take not on me here as a physician,</li>
  <li>Nor do I as an enemy to peace</li>
  <li class="number">Troop in the throngs of military men;</li>
  <li>But rather show awhile like fearful war,</li>
  <li>To diet rank minds sick of happiness</li>
  <li>And purge the obstructions which begin to stop</li>
  <li>Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.</li>
  <li class="number">I have in equal balance justly weigh’d</li>
  <li>What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,</li>
  <li>And find our griefs heavier than our offences.</li>
  <li>We see which way the stream of time doth run,</li>
  <li>And are enforced from our most quiet there</li>
  <li class="number">By the rough torrent of occasion;</li>
  <li>And have the summary of all our griefs,</li>
  <li>When time shall serve, to show in articles;</li>
  <li>Which long ere this we offer’d to the king,</li>
  <li>And might by no suit gain our audience:</li>
  <li class="number">When we are wrong’d and would unfold our griefs,</li>
  <li>We are denied access unto his person</li>
  <li>Even by those men that most have done us wrong.</li>
  <li>The dangers of the days but newly gone,</li>
  <li>Whose memory is written on the earth</li>
  <li class="number">With yet appearing blood, and the examples</li>
  <li>Of every minute’s instance, present now,</li>
  <li>Hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms,</li>
  <li>Not to break peace or any branch of it,</li>
  <li>But to establish here a peace indeed,</li>
  <li class="number">Concurring both in name and quality.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WESTMORELAND">
  <li>When ever yet was your appeal denied?</li>
  <li>Wherein have you been galled by the king?</li>
  <li>What peer hath been suborn’d to grate on you,</li>
  <li>That you should seal this lawless bloody book</li>
  <li class="number">Of forged rebellion with a seal divine</li>
  <li>And consecrate commotion’s bitter edge?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARCHBISHOP OF YORK">
  <li>My brother general, the commonwealth,</li>
  <li>To brother born an household cruelty,</li>
  <li>I make my quarrel in particular.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WESTMORELAND">
  <li class="number">There is no need of any such redress;</li>
  <li>Or if there were, it not belongs to you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOWBRAY">
  <li>Why not to him in part, and to us all</li>
  <li>That feel the bruises of the days before,</li>
  <li>And suffer the condition of these times</li>
  <li class="number">To lay a heavy and unequal hand</li>
  <li>Upon our honours?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WESTMORELAND">
  <li>O, my good Lord Mowbray,</li>
  <li>Construe the times to their necessities,</li>
  <li>And you shall say indeed, it is the time,</li>
  <li class="number">And not the king, that doth you injuries.</li>
  <li>Yet for your part, it not appears to me</li>
  <li>Either from the king or in the present time</li>
  <li>That you should have an inch of any ground</li>
  <li>To build a grief on: were you not restored</li>
  <li class="number">To all the Duke of Norfolk’s signories,</li>
  <li>Your noble and right well remember’d father’s?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOWBRAY">
  <li>What thing, in honour, had my father lost,</li>
  <li>That need to be revived and breathed in me?</li>
  <li>The king that loved him, as the state stood then,</li>
  <li class="number">Was force perforce compell’d to banish him:</li>
  <li>And then that Harry Bolingbroke and he,</li>
  <li>Being mounted and both roused in their seats,</li>
  <li>Their neighing coursers daring of the spur,</li>
  <li>Their armed staves in charge, their beavers down,</li>
  <li class="number">Their eyes of fire sparking through sights of steel</li>
  <li>And the loud trumpet blowing them together,</li>
  <li>Then, then, when there was nothing could have stay’d</li>
  <li>My father from the breast of Bolingbroke,</li>
  <li>O when the king did throw his warder down,</li>
  <li class="number">His own life hung upon the staff he threw;</li>
  <li>Then threw he down himself and all their lives</li>
  <li>That by indictment and by dint of sword</li>
  <li>Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WESTMORELAND">
  <li>You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.</li>
  <li class="number">The Earl of Hereford was reputed then</li>
  <li>In England the most valiant gentlemen:</li>
  <li>Who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled?</li>
  <li>But if your father had been victor there,</li>
  <li>He ne’er had borne it out of Coventry:</li>
  <li class="number">For all the country in a general voice</li>
  <li>Cried hate upon him; and all their prayers and love</li>
  <li>Were set on Hereford, whom they doted on</li>
  <li>And bless’d and graced indeed, more than the king.</li>
  <li>But this is mere digression from my purpose.</li>
  <li class="number">Here come I from our princely general</li>
  <li>To know your griefs; to tell you from his grace</li>
  <li>That he will give you audience; and wherein</li>
  <li>It shall appear that your demands are just,</li>
  <li>You shall enjoy them, every thing set off</li>
  <li class="number">That might so much as think you enemies.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOWBRAY">
  <li>But he hath forced us to compel this offer;</li>
  <li>And it proceeds from policy, not love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WESTMORELAND">
  <li>Mowbray, you overween to take it so;</li>
  <li>This offer comes from mercy, not from fear:</li>
  <li class="number">For, lo! within a ken our army lies,</li>
  <li>Upon mine honour, all too confident</li>
  <li>To give admittance to a thought of fear.</li>
  <li>Our battle is more full of names than yours,</li>
  <li>Our men more perfect in the use of arms,</li>
  <li class="number">Our armour all as strong, our cause the best;</li>
  <li>Then reason will our heart should be as good</li>
  <li>Say you not then our offer is compell’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOWBRAY">
  <li>Well, by my will we shall admit no parley.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WESTMORELAND">
  <li>That argues but the shame of your offence:</li>
  <li class="number">A rotten case abides no handling.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HASTINGS">
  <li>Hath the Prince John a full commission,</li>
  <li>In very ample virtue of his father,</li>
  <li>To hear and absolutely to determine</li>
  <li>Of what conditions we shall stand upon?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WESTMORELAND">
  <li class="number">That is intended in the general’s name:</li>
  <li>I muse you make so slight a question.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARCHBISHOP OF YORK">
  <li>Then take, my Lord of Westmoreland, this schedule,</li>
  <li>For this contains our general grievances:</li>
  <li>Each several article herein redress’d,</li>
  <li class="number">All members of our cause, both here and hence,</li>
  <li>That are insinew’d to this action,</li>
  <li>Acquitted by a true substantial form</li>
  <li>And present execution of our wills</li>
  <li>To us and to our purposes confined,</li>
  <li class="number">We come within our awful banks again</li>
  <li>And knit our powers to the arm of peace.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WESTMORELAND">
  <li>This will I show the general. Please you, lords,</li>
  <li>In sight of both our battles we may meet;</li>
  <li>And either end in peace, which God so frame!</li>
  <li class="number">Or to the place of difference call the swords</li>
  <li>Which must decide it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARCHBISHOP OF YORK">
  <li>My lord, we will do so.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit WESTMORELAND</div>

<ol data-speaker="MOWBRAY">
  <li>There is a thing within my bosom tells me</li>
  <li>That no conditions of our peace can stand.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HASTINGS">
  <li class="number">Fear you not that: if we can make our peace</li>
  <li>Upon such large terms and so absolute</li>
  <li>As our conditions shall consist upon,</li>
  <li>Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOWBRAY">
  <li>Yea, but our valuation shall be such</li>
  <li class="number">That every slight and false-derived cause,</li>
  <li>Yea, every idle, nice and wanton reason</li>
  <li>Shall to the king taste of this action;</li>
  <li>That, were our royal faiths martyrs in love,</li>
  <li>We shall be winnow’d with so rough a wind</li>
  <li class="number">That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff</li>
  <li>And good from bad find no partition.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARCHBISHOP OF YORK">
  <li>No, no, my lord. Note this; the king is weary</li>
  <li>Of dainty and such picking grievances:</li>
  <li>For he hath found to end one doubt by death</li>
  <li class="number">Revives two greater in the heirs of life,</li>
  <li>And therefore will he wipe his tables clean</li>
  <li>And keep no tell-tale to his memory</li>
  <li>That may repeat and history his loss</li>
  <li>To new remembrance; for full well he knows</li>
  <li class="number">He cannot so precisely weed this land</li>
  <li>As his misdoubts present occasion:</li>
  <li>His foes are so enrooted with his friends</li>
  <li>That, plucking to unfix an enemy,</li>
  <li>He doth unfasten so and shake a friend:</li>
  <li class="number">So that this land, like an offensive wife</li>
  <li>That hath enraged him on to offer strokes,</li>
  <li>As he is striking, holds his infant up</li>
  <li>And hangs resolved correction in the arm</li>
  <li>That was uprear’d to execution.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HASTINGS">
  <li class="number">Besides, the king hath wasted all his rods</li>
  <li>On late offenders, that he now doth lack</li>
  <li>The very instruments of chastisement:</li>
  <li>So that his power, like to a fangless lion,</li>
  <li>May offer, but not hold.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARCHBISHOP OF YORK">
  <li class="number">’Tis very true:</li>
  <li>And therefore be assured, my good lord marshal,</li>
  <li>If we do now make our atonement well,</li>
  <li>Our peace will, like a broken limb united,</li>
  <li>Grow stronger for the breaking.</li>
</ol>

<h3>SCENE II.  Another part of the forest.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter, from one side, MOWBRAY, attended; afterwards
the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, HASTINGS, and others: from
the other side, Prince John of LANCASTER, and
WESTMORELAND; Officers, and others with them</div>

<ol data-speaker="LANCASTER">
  <li>You are well encounter’d here, my cousin Mowbray:</li>
  <li>Good day to you, gentle lord archbishop;</li>
  <li>And so to you, Lord Hastings, and to all.</li>
  <li>My Lord of York, it better show’d with you</li>
  <li class="number">When that your flock, assembled by the bell,</li>
  <li>Encircled you to hear with reverence</li>
  <li>Your exposition on the holy text</li>
  <li>Than now to see you here an iron man,</li>
  <li>Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum,</li>
  <li class="number">Turning the word to sword and life to death.</li>
  <li>That man that sits within a monarch’s heart,</li>
  <li>And ripens in the sunshine of his favour,</li>
  <li>Would he abuse the countenance of the king,</li>
  <li>Alack, what mischiefs might he set abrooch</li>
  <li class="number">In shadow of such greatness! With you, lord bishop,</li>
  <li>It is even so. Who hath not heard it spoken</li>
  <li>How deep you were within the books of God?</li>
  <li>To us the speaker in his parliament;</li>
  <li>To us the imagined voice of God himself;</li>
  <li class="number">The very opener and intelligencer</li>
  <li>Between the grace, the sanctities of heaven</li>
  <li>And our dull workings. O, who shall believe</li>
  <li>But you misuse the reverence of your place,</li>
  <li>Employ the countenance and grace of heaven,</li>
  <li class="number">As a false favourite doth his prince’s name,</li>
  <li>In deeds dishonourable? You have ta’en up,</li>
  <li>Under the counterfeited zeal of God,</li>
  <li>The subjects of his substitute, my father,</li>
  <li>And both against the peace of heaven and him</li>
  <li class="number">Have here up-swarm’d them.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARCHBISHOP OF YORK">
  <li>Good my Lord of Lancaster,</li>
  <li>I am not here against your father’s peace;</li>
  <li>But, as I told my lord of Westmoreland,</li>
  <li>The time misorder’d doth, in common sense,</li>
  <li class="number">Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form,</li>
  <li>To hold our safety up. I sent your grace</li>
  <li>The parcels and particulars of our grief,</li>
  <li>The which hath been with scorn shoved from the court,</li>
  <li>Whereon this Hydra son of war is born;</li>
  <li class="number">Whose dangerous eyes may well be charm’d asleep</li>
  <li>With grant of our most just and right desires,</li>
  <li>And true obedience, of this madness cured,</li>
  <li>Stoop tamely to the foot of majesty.</li>

  <li>If not, we ready are to try our fortunes</li>

  <li>And though we here fall down,</li>
  <li>We have supplies to second our attempt:</li>
  <li>If they miscarry, theirs shall second them;</li>
  <li>And so success of mischief shall be born</li>
  <li class="number">And heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up</li>
  <li>Whiles England shall have generation.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LANCASTER">
  <li>You are too shallow, Hastings, much too shallow,</li>
  <li>To sound the bottom of the after-times.</li>

  <li>I like them all, and do allow them well,</li>
  <li>And swear here, by the honour of my blood,</li>
  <li>My father’s purposes have been mistook,</li>
  <li>And some about him have too lavishly</li>
  <li class="number">Wrested his meaning and authority.</li>
  <li>My lord, these griefs shall be with speed redress’d;</li>
  <li>Upon my soul, they shall. If this may please you,</li>
  <li>Discharge your powers unto their several counties,</li>
  <li>As we will ours: and here between the armies</li>
  <li class="number">Let’s drink together friendly and embrace,</li>
  <li>That all their eyes may bear those tokens home</li>

  <li>Believe me, I am passing light in spirit.</li>

  <li class="number">I would you had but the wit: ’twere better than</li>
  <li>your dukedom. Good faith, this same young sober-</li>
  <li>blooded boy doth not love me; nor a man cannot make</li>
  <li>him laugh; but that’s no marvel, he drinks no wine.</li>
  <li>There’s never none of these demure boys come to any</li>
  <li class="number">proof; for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood,</li>
  <li>and making many fish-meals, that they fall into a</li>
  <li>kind of male green-sickness; and then when they</li>
  <li>marry, they get wenches: they are generally fools</li>
  <li>and cowards; which some of us should be too, but for</li>
  <li class="number">inflammation. A good sherris sack hath a two-fold</li>
  <li>operation in it. It ascends me into the brain;</li>
  <li>dries me there all the foolish and dull and curdy</li>
  <li>vapours which environ it; makes it apprehensive,</li>
  <li>quick, forgetive, full of nimble fiery and</li>
  <li class="number">delectable shapes, which, delivered o’er to the</li>
  <li>voice, the tongue, which is the birth, becomes</li>
  <li>excellent wit. The second property of your</li>
  <li>excellent sherris is, the warming of the blood;</li>
  <li>which, before cold and settled, left the liver</li>
  <li class="number">white and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity</li>
  <li>and cowardice; but the sherris warms it and makes</li>
  <li>it course from the inwards to the parts extreme:</li>
  <li>it illumineth the face, which as a beacon gives</li>
  <li>warning to all the rest of this little kingdom,</li>
  <li class="number">man, to arm; and then the vital commoners and</li>
  <li>inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain,</li>
  <li>the heart, who, great and puffed up with this</li>
  <li>retinue, doth any deed of courage; and this valour</li>
  <li>comes of sherris. So that skill in the weapon is</li>
  <li class="number">nothing without sack, for that sets it a-work; and</li>
  <li>learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil, till</li>
  <li>sack commences it and sets it in act and use.</li>
  <li>Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant; for</li>
  <li>the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his</li>
  <li class="number">father, he hath, like lean, sterile and bare land,</li>
  <li>manured, husbanded and tilled with excellent</li>
  <li>endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile</li>
  <li>sherris, that he is become very hot and valiant. If</li>
  <li>I had a thousand sons, the first humane principle I</li>
  <li class="number">would teach them should be, to forswear thin</li>
  <li>potations and to addict themselves to sack.</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY IV">
  <li>Now, lords, if God doth give successful end</li>

  <li class="number">Our navy is address’d, our power collected,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>Both which we doubt not but your majesty</li>

  <li>Humphrey, my son of Gloucester,</li>
  <li>Where is the prince your brother?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li class="number">I think he’s gone to hunt, my lord, at Windsor.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY IV">
  <li>And how accompanied?</li>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">

  <li>Is not his brother, Thomas of Clarence, with him?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>No, my good lord; he is in presence here.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li class="number">What would my lord and father?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY IV">
  <li>Nothing but well to thee, Thomas of Clarence.</li>
  <li>How chance thou art not with the prince thy brother?</li>
  <li>He loves thee, and thou dost neglect him, Thomas;</li>
  <li>Thou hast a better place in his affection</li>
  <li class="number">Than all thy brothers: cherish it, my boy,</li>
  <li>And noble offices thou mayst effect</li>
  <li>Of mediation, after I am dead,</li>
  <li>Between his greatness and thy other brethren:</li>
  <li>Therefore omit him not; blunt not his love,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor lose the good advantage of his grace</li>
  <li>By seeming cold or careless of his will;</li>
  <li>For he is gracious, if he be observed:</li>
  <li>He hath a tear for pity and a hand</li>
  <li>Open as day for melting charity:</li>
  <li class="number">Yet notwithstanding, being incensed, he’s flint,</li>
  <li>As humorous as winter and as sudden</li>
  <li>As flaws congealed in the spring of day.</li>
  <li>His temper, therefore, must be well observed:</li>
  <li>Chide him for faults, and do it reverently,</li>
  <li class="number">When thou perceive his blood inclined to mirth;</li>
  <li>But, being moody, give him line and scope,</li>
  <li>Till that his passions, like a whale on ground,</li>
  <li>Confound themselves with working. Learn this, Thomas,</li>
  <li>And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends,</li>
  <li class="number">A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,</li>
  <li>That the united vessel of their blood,</li>
  <li>Mingled with venom of suggestion — </li>
  <li>As, force perforce, the age will pour it in — </li>
  <li>Shall never leak, though it do work as strong</li>
  <li class="number">As aconitum or rash gunpowder.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li>I shall observe him with all care and love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY IV">
  <li>Why art thou not at Windsor with him, Thomas?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li>He is not there to-day; he dines in London.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY IV">
  <li>And how accompanied? canst thou tell that?</li>
</ol>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY IV">
  <li>Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds;</li>
  <li>And he, the noble image of my youth,</li>
  <li>Is overspread with them: therefore my grief</li>
  <li>Stretches itself beyond the hour of death:</li>
  <li class="number">The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape</li>
  <li>In forms imaginary the unguided days</li>
  <li>And rotten times that you shall look upon</li>
  <li>When I am sleeping with my ancestors.</li>
  <li>For when his headstrong riot hath no curb,</li>
  <li class="number">When rage and hot blood are his counsellors,</li>
  <li>When means and lavish manners meet together,</li>
  <li>O, with what wings shall his affections fly</li>
  <li>Towards fronting peril and opposed decay!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>My gracious lord, you look beyond him quite:</li>

  <li>Like a strange tongue, wherein, to gain the language,</li>
  <li>’Tis needful that the most immodest word</li>
  <li>Be look’d upon and learn’d; which once attain’d,</li>
  <li>Your highness knows, comes to no further use</li>
  <li class="number">But to be known and hated. So, like gross terms,</li>
  <li>The prince will in the perfectness of time</li>
  <li>Cast off his followers; and their memory</li>
  <li>Shall as a pattern or a measure live,</li>
  <li>By which his grace must mete the lives of others,</li>
  <li class="number">Turning past evils to advantages.</li>

  <li>The manner and true order of the fight</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY IV">
  <li>And wherefore should these good news make me sick?</li>
  <li>Will fortune never come with both hands full,</li>

  <li>She either gives a stomach and no food;</li>
  <li class="number">Such are the poor, in health; or else a feast</li>

  <li>No, no, he cannot long hold out these pangs:</li>

  <li>And He that wears the crown immortally</li>
  <li>Long guard it yours! If I affect it more</li>
  <li>Than as your honour and as your renown,</li>
  <li>Let me no more from this obedience rise,</li>
  <li class="number">Which my most inward true and duteous spirit</li>
  <li>Teacheth, this prostrate and exterior bending.</li>
  <li>God witness with me, when I here came in,</li>
  <li>And found no course of breath within your majesty,</li>
  <li>How cold it struck my heart! If I do feign,</li>
  <li class="number">O, let me in my present wildness die</li>
  <li>And never live to show the incredulous world</li>
  <li>The noble change that I have purposed!</li>
  <li>Coming to look on you, thinking you dead,</li>
  <li>And dead almost, my liege, to think you were,</li>
  <li class="number">I spake unto this crown as having sense,</li>
  <li>And thus upbraided it: ’The care on thee depending</li>
  <li>Hath fed upon the body of my father;</li>
  <li>Therefore, thou best of gold art worst of gold:</li>
  <li>Other, less fine in carat, is more precious,</li>
  <li class="number">Preserving life in medicine potable;</li>
  <li>But thou, most fine, most honour’d: most renown’d,</li>
  <li>Hast eat thy bearer up.’ Thus, my most royal liege,</li>
  <li>Accusing it, I put it on my head,</li>
  <li>To try with it, as with an enemy</li>
  <li class="number">That had before my face murder’d my father,</li>
  <li>The quarrel of a true inheritor.</li>
  <li>But if it did infect my blood with joy,</li>
  <li>Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride;</li>
  <li>If any rebel or vain spirit of mine</li>
  <li class="number">Did with the least affection of a welcome</li>
  <li>Give entertainment to the might of it,</li>
  <li>Let God for ever keep it from my head</li>
  <li>And make me as the poorest vassal is</li>
  <li>That doth with awe and terror kneel to it!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY IV">
  <li class="number">O my son,</li>
  <li>God put it in thy mind to take it hence,</li>
  <li>That thou mightst win the more thy father’s love,</li>
  <li>Pleading so wisely in excuse of it!</li>
  <li>Come hither, Harry, sit thou by my bed;</li>
  <li class="number">And hear, I think, the very latest counsel</li>
  <li>That ever I shall breathe. God knows, my son,</li>
  <li>By what by-paths and indirect crook’d ways</li>
  <li>I met this crown; and I myself know well</li>
  <li>How troublesome it sat upon my head.</li>
  <li class="number">To thee it shall descend with bitter quiet,</li>
  <li>Better opinion, better confirmation;</li>
  <li>For all the soil of the achievement goes</li>
  <li>With me into the earth. It seem’d in me</li>
  <li>But as an honour snatch’d with boisterous hand,</li>
  <li class="number">And I had many living to upbraid</li>
  <li>My gain of it by their assistances;</li>
  <li>Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed,</li>
  <li>Wounding supposed peace: all these bold fears</li>
  <li>Thou see’st with peril I have answered;</li>
  <li class="number">For all my reign hath been but as a scene</li>
  <li>Acting that argument: and now my death</li>
  <li>Changes the mode; for what in me was purchased,</li>
  <li>Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort;</li>
  <li>So thou the garland wear’st successively.</li>
  <li class="number">Yet, though thou stand’st more sure than I could do,</li>
  <li>Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green;</li>
  <li>And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends,</li>
  <li>Have but their stings and teeth newly ta’en out;</li>
  <li>By whose fell working I was first advanced</li>
  <li class="number">And by whose power I well might lodge a fear</li>
  <li>To be again displaced: which to avoid,</li>
  <li>I cut them off; and had a purpose now</li>
  <li>To lead out many to the Holy Land,</li>
  <li>Lest rest and lying still might make them look</li>
  <li class="number">Too near unto my state. Therefore, my Harry,</li>
  <li>Be it thy course to busy giddy minds</li>
  <li>With foreign quarrels; that action, hence borne out,</li>
  <li>May waste the memory of the former days.</li>
  <li>More would I, but my lungs are wasted so</li>
  <li class="number">That strength of speech is utterly denied me.</li>

  <li>I grant your worship that he is a knave, sir; but</li>

  <li>that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is</li>
  <li class="number">caught, as men take diseases, one of another:</li>

  <li>Hear your own dignity so much profaned,</li>

  <li>For which, I do commit into your hand</li>
  <li class="number">The unstained sword that you have used to bear;</li>
  <li>With this remembrance, that you use the same</li>
  <li>With the like bold, just and impartial spirit</li>
  <li>As you have done ’gainst me. There is my hand.</li>
  <li>You shall be as a father to my youth:</li>
  <li class="number">My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear,</li>
  <li>And I will stoop and humble my intents</li>
  <li>To your well-practised wise directions.</li>
  <li>And, princes all, believe me, I beseech you;</li>
  <li>My father is gone wild into his grave,</li>
  <li class="number">For in his tomb lie my affections;</li>
  <li>And with his spirit sadly I survive,</li>
  <li>To mock the expectation of the world,</li>
  <li>To frustrate prophecies and to raze out</li>
  <li>Rotten opinion, who hath writ me down</li>
  <li class="number">After my seeming. The tide of blood in me</li>
  <li>Hath proudly flow’d in vanity till now:</li>
  <li>Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea,</li>
  <li>Where it shall mingle with the state of floods</li>
  <li>And flow henceforth in formal majesty.</li>
  <li class="number">Now call we our high court of parliament:</li>
  <li>And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel,</li>
  <li>That the great body of our state may go</li>
  <li>In equal rank with the best govern’d nation;</li>
  <li>That war, or peace, or both at once, may be</li>
  <li class="number">As things acquainted and familiar to us;</li>
  <li>In which you, father, shall have foremost hand.</li>
  <li>Our coronation done, we will accite,</li>
  <li>As I before remember’d, all our state:</li>
