<section class="scene">

<h3>SCENE I.  London. The Parliament-house.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Alarum. Enter YORK, EDWARD, RICHARD, NORFOLK, MONTAGUE, WARWICK, and Soldiers</div>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>I wonder how the king escaped our hands.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li>While we pursued the horsemen of the north,</li>
  <li>He slily stole away and left his men:</li>
  <li>Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,</li>
  <li>Cheer’d up the drooping army; and himself,</li>
  <li>Lord Clifford and Lord Stafford, all abreast,</li>
  <li>Charged our main battle’s front, and breaking in</li>
  <li>Were by the swords of common soldiers slain.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EDWARD">
  <li class="number">Lord Stafford’s father, Duke of Buckingham,</li>
  <li>Is either slain or wounded dangerously;</li>
  <li>I cleft his beaver with a downright blow:</li>
  <li>That this is true, father, behold his blood.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MONTAGUE">
  <li>And, brother, here’s the Earl of Wiltshire’s blood,</li>
  <li class="number">Whom I encounter’d as the battles join’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RICHARD">
  <li>Speak thou for me and tell them what I did.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Throwing down SOMERSET’s head</div>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li>Richard hath best deserved of all my sons.</li>
  <li>But is your grace dead, my Lord of Somerset?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORFOLK">
  <li>Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RICHARD">
  <li class="number">Thus do I hope to shake King Henry’s head.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>And so do I. Victorious Prince of York,</li>
  <li>Before I see thee seated in that throne</li>
  <li>Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,</li>
  <li>I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.</li>
  <li class="number">This is the palace of the fearful king,</li>
  <li>And this the regal seat: possess it, York;</li>
  <li>For this is thine and not King Henry’s heirs’</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li>Assist me, then, sweet Warwick, and I will;</li>
  <li>For hither we have broken in by force.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORFOLK">
  <li class="number">We’ll all assist you; he that flies shall die.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li>Thanks, gentle Norfolk: stay by me, my lords;</li>
  <li>And, soldiers, stay and lodge by me this night.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">They go up</div>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>And when the king comes, offer no violence,</li>
  <li>Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li class="number">The queen this day here holds her parliament,</li>
  <li>But little thinks we shall be of her council:</li>
  <li>By words or blows here let us win our right.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RICHARD">
  <li>Arm’d as we are, let’s stay within this house.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>The bloody parliament shall this be call’d,</li>
  <li class="number">Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be king,</li>
  <li>And bashful Henry deposed, whose cowardice</li>
  <li>Hath made us by-words to our enemies.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li>Then leave me not, my lords; be resolute;</li>
  <li>I mean to take possession of my right.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li class="number">Neither the king, nor he that loves him best,</li>
  <li>The proudest he that holds up Lancaster,</li>
  <li>Dares stir a wing, if Warwick shake his bells.</li>
  <li>I’ll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares:</li>
  <li>Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, CLIFFORD,
NORTHUMBERLAND, WESTMORELAND, EXETER, and the rest</div>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">
  <li class="number">My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,</li>
  <li>Even in the chair of state: belike he means,</li>
  <li>Back’d by the power of Warwick, that false peer,</li>
  <li>To aspire unto the crown and reign as king.</li>
  <li>Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father.</li>
  <li class="number">And thine, Lord Clifford; and you both have vow’d revenge</li>
  <li>On him, his sons, his favourites and his friends.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTHUMBERLAND">
  <li>If I be not, heavens be revenged on me!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLIFFORD">
  <li>The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WESTMORELAND">
  <li>What, shall we suffer this? let’s pluck him down:</li>
  <li class="number">My heart for anger burns; I cannot brook it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">
  <li>Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLIFFORD">
  <li>Patience is for poltroons, such as he:</li>
  <li>He durst not sit there, had your father lived.</li>
  <li>My gracious lord, here in the parliament</li>
  <li class="number">Let us assail the family of York.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTHUMBERLAND">
  <li>Well hast thou spoken, cousin: be it so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">
  <li>Ah, know you not the city favours them,</li>
  <li>And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EXETER">
  <li>But when the duke is slain, they’ll quickly fly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">
  <li class="number">Far be the thought of this from Henry’s heart,</li>
  <li>To make a shambles of the parliament-house!</li>
  <li>Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words and threats</li>
  <li>Shall be the war that Henry means to use.</li>
  <li>Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne,</li>
  <li class="number">and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet;</li>
  <li>I am thy sovereign.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li>I am thine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EXETER">
  <li>For shame, come down: he made thee Duke of York.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li>’Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EXETER">
  <li class="number">Thy father was a traitor to the crown.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown</li>
  <li>In following this usurping Henry.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLIFFORD">
  <li>Whom should he follow but his natural king?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>True, Clifford; and that’s Richard Duke of York.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">
  <li class="number">And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li>It must and shall be so: content thyself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be king.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WESTMORELAND">
  <li>He is both king and Duke of Lancaster;</li>
  <li>And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li class="number">And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget</li>
  <li>That we are those which chased you from the field</li>
  <li>And slew your fathers, and with colours spread</li>
  <li>March’d through the city to the palace gates.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTHUMBERLAND">
  <li>Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief;</li>
  <li class="number">And, by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WESTMORELAND">
  <li>Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,</li>
  <li>Thy kinsman and thy friends, I’ll have more lives</li>
  <li>Than drops of blood were in my father’s veins.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLIFFORD">
  <li>Urge it no more; lest that, instead of words,</li>
  <li class="number">I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger</li>
  <li>As shall revenge his death before I stir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>Poor Clifford! how I scorn his worthless threats!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li>Will you we show our title to the crown?</li>
  <li>If not, our swords shall plead it in the field.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">
  <li class="number">What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?</li>
  <li>Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York;</li>
  <li>Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March:</li>
  <li>I am the son of Henry the Fifth,</li>
  <li>Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop</li>
  <li class="number">And seized upon their towns and provinces.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">
  <li>The lord protector lost it, and not I:</li>
  <li>When I was crown’d I was but nine months old.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RICHARD">
  <li>You are old enough now, and yet, methinks, you lose.</li>
  <li class="number">Father, tear the crown from the usurper’s head.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EDWARD">
  <li>Sweet father, do so; set it on your head.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MONTAGUE">
  <li>Good brother, as thou lovest and honourest arms,</li>
  <li>Let’s fight it out and not stand cavilling thus.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RICHARD">
  <li>Sound drums and trumpets, and the king will fly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li class="number">Sons, peace!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">
  <li>Peace, thou! and give King Henry leave to speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>Plantagenet shall speak first: hear him, lords;</li>
  <li>And be you silent and attentive too,</li>
  <li>For he that interrupts him shall not live.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">
  <li class="number">Think’st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,</li>
  <li>Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?</li>
  <li>No: first shall war unpeople this my realm;</li>
  <li>Ay, and their colours, often borne in France,</li>
  <li>And now in England to our heart’s great sorrow,</li>
  <li class="number">Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?</li>
  <li>My title’s good, and better far than his.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be king.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">
  <li>Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li>’Twas by rebellion against his king.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">
  <li class="number"><span class="stage-direction">Aside</span>  I know not what to say; my title’s weak. — </li>
  <li>Tell me, may not a king adopt an heir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li>What then?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">
  <li>An if he may, then am I lawful king;</li>
  <li>For Richard, in the view of many lords,</li>
  <li class="number">Resign’d the crown to Henry the Fourth,</li>
  <li>Whose heir my father was, and I am his.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li>He rose against him, being his sovereign,</li>
  <li>And made him to resign his crown perforce.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain’d,</li>
  <li class="number">Think you ’twere prejudicial to his crown?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EXETER">
  <li>No; for he could not so resign his crown</li>
  <li>But that the next heir should succeed and reign.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">
  <li>Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EXETER">
  <li>His is the right, and therefore pardon me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li class="number">Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EXETER">
  <li>My conscience tells me he is lawful king.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">
  <li><span class="stage-direction">Aside</span>  All will revolt from me, and turn to him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTHUMBERLAND">
  <li>Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay’st,</li>
  <li>Think not that Henry shall be so deposed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li class="number">Deposed he shall be, in despite of all.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTHUMBERLAND">
  <li>Thou art deceived: ’tis not thy southern power,</li>
  <li>Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent,</li>
  <li>Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud,</li>
  <li>Can set the duke up in despite of me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLIFFORD">
  <li class="number">King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,</li>
  <li>Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence:</li>
  <li>May that ground gape and swallow me alive,</li>
  <li>Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">
  <li>O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li class="number">Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.</li>
  <li>What mutter you, or what conspire you, lords?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>Do right unto this princely Duke of York,</li>
  <li>Or I will fill the house with armed men,</li>
  <li>And over the chair of state, where now he sits,</li>
  <li class="number">Write up his title with usurping blood.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">He stamps with his foot and the soldiers show
themselves</div>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">
  <li>My Lord of Warwick, hear me but one word:</li>
  <li>Let me for this my life-time reign as king.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li>Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,</li>
  <li>And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">
  <li class="number">I am content: Richard Plantagenet,</li>
  <li>Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLIFFORD">
  <li>What wrong is this unto the prince your son!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>What good is this to England and himself!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WESTMORELAND">
  <li>Base, fearful and despairing Henry!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLIFFORD">
  <li class="number">How hast thou injured both thyself and us!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WESTMORELAND">
  <li>I cannot stay to hear these articles.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTHUMBERLAND">
  <li>Nor I.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLIFFORD">
  <li>Come, cousin, let us tell the queen these news.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WESTMORELAND">
  <li>Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king,</li>
  <li class="number">In whose cold blood no spark of honour bides.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTHUMBERLAND">
  <li>Be thou a prey unto the house of York,</li>
  <li>And die in bands for this unmanly deed!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLIFFORD">
  <li>In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome,</li>
  <li>Or live in peace abandon’d and despised!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt NORTHUMBERLAND, CLIFFORD, and WESTMORELAND</div>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li class="number">Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EXETER">
  <li>They seek revenge and therefore will not yield.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">
  <li>Ah, Exeter!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>Why should you sigh, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">
  <li>Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son,</li>
  <li class="number">Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit.</li>
  <li>But be it as it may: I here entail</li>
  <li>The crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever;</li>
  <li>Conditionally, that here thou take an oath</li>
  <li>To cease this civil war, and, whilst I live,</li>
  <li class="number">To honour me as thy king and sovereign,</li>
  <li>And neither by treason nor hostility</li>
  <li>To seek to put me down and reign thyself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li>This oath I willingly take and will perform.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>Long live King Henry! Plantagenet embrace him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">
  <li class="number">And long live thou and these thy forward sons!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li>Now York and Lancaster are reconciled.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EXETER">
  <li>Accursed be he that seeks to make them foes!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Sennet. Here they come down</div>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li>Farewell, my gracious lord; I’ll to my castle.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>And I’ll keep London with my soldiers.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORFOLK">

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">

<div class="stage-direction">Enter QUEEN MARGARET and PRINCE EDWARD</div>

<ol data-speaker="EXETER">
  <li>Here comes the queen, whose looks bewray her anger:</li>
  <li>I’ll steal away.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">
  <li class="number">Exeter, so will I.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN MARGARET">
  <li>Nay, go not from me; I will follow thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">
  <li>Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN MARGARET">
  <li>Who can be patient in such extremes?</li>
  <li>Ah, wretched man! would I had died a maid</li>
  <li class="number">And never seen thee, never borne thee son,</li>
  <li>Seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father</li>
  <li>Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?</li>

  <li>Or felt that pain which I did for him once,</li>
  <li class="number">Or nourish’d him as I did with my blood,</li>
  <li>Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there,</li>
  <li>Rather than have that savage duke thine heir</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE EDWARD">
  <li>Father, you cannot disinherit me:</li>
  <li class="number">If you be king, why should not I succeed?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">
  <li>Pardon me, Margaret; pardon me, sweet son:</li>
  <li>The Earl of Warwick and the duke enforced me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN MARGARET">
  <li>Enforced thee! art thou king, and wilt be forced?</li>
  <li>I shame to hear thee speak. Ah, timorous wretch!</li>
  <li class="number">Thou hast undone thyself, thy son and me;</li>
  <li>And given unto the house of York such head</li>
  <li>As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance.</li>
  <li>To entail him and his heirs unto the crown,</li>
  <li>What is it, but to make thy sepulchre</li>
  <li class="number">And creep into it far before thy time?</li>
  <li>Warwick is chancellor and the lord of Calais;</li>
  <li>Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas;</li>
  <li>The duke is made protector of the realm;</li>
  <li>And yet shalt thou be safe? such safety finds</li>
  <li class="number">The trembling lamb environed with wolves.</li>
  <li>Had I been there, which am a silly woman,</li>
  <li>The soldiers should have toss’d me on their pikes</li>
  <li>Before I would have granted to that act.</li>
  <li>But thou preferr’st thy life before thine honour:</li>
  <li class="number">And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself</li>
  <li>Both from thy table, Henry, and thy bed,</li>
  <li>Until that act of parliament be repeal’d</li>
  <li>Whereby my son is disinherited.</li>
  <li>The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours</li>
  <li class="number">Will follow mine, if once they see them spread;</li>
  <li>And spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace</li>
  <li>And utter ruin of the house of York.</li>
  <li>Thus do I leave thee. Come, son, let’s away;</li>
  <li>Our army is ready; come, we’ll after them.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">
  <li class="number">Stay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN MARGARET">
  <li>Thou hast spoke too much already: get thee gone.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">
  <li>Gentle son Edward, thou wilt stay with me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN MARGARET">
  <li>Ay, to be murder’d by his enemies.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE EDWARD">
  <li>When I return with victory from the field</li>

  <li>The loss of those three lords torments my heart:</li>

  <li>Why, how now, sons and brother! at a strife?</li>
  <li class="number">What is your quarrel? how began it first?</li>

<ol data-speaker="EDWARD">
  <li>No quarrel, but a slight contention.</li>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li>About what?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RICHARD">
  <li>About that which concerns your grace and us;</li>

  <li>And many strokes, though with a little axe,</li>

  <li>By many hands your father was subdued;</li>

  <li>Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,</li>
  <li>Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay.</li>
  <li class="number">O Clifford, boisterous Clifford! thou hast slain</li>
  <li>The flower of Europe for his chivalry;</li>
  <li>And treacherously hast thou vanquish’d him,</li>
  <li>For hand to hand he would have vanquish’d thee.</li>
  <li>Now my soul’s palace is become a prison:</li>
  <li class="number">Ah, would she break from hence, that this my body</li>
  <li>Might in the ground be closed up in rest!</li>
  <li>For never henceforth shall I joy again,</li>
  <li>Never, O never shall I see more joy!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RICHARD">
  <li>I cannot weep; for all my body’s moisture</li>
  <li class="number">Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart:</li>
  <li>Nor can my tongue unload my heart’s great burthen;</li>
  <li>For selfsame wind that I should speak withal</li>
  <li>Is kindling coals that fires all my breast,</li>
  <li>And burns me up with flames that tears would quench.</li>
  <li class="number">To weep is to make less the depth of grief:</li>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li class="number">How now, fair lords! What fare? what news abroad?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RICHARD">
  <li>Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount</li>
  <li>Our baleful news, and at each word’s deliverance</li>
  <li>Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told,</li>
  <li>The words would add more anguish than the wounds.</li>
  <li class="number">O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EDWARD">
  <li>O Warwick, Warwick! that Plantagenet,</li>
  <li>Which held three dearly as his soul’s redemption,</li>
  <li>Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>Ten days ago I drown’d these news in tears;</li>
  <li class="number">And now, to add more measure to your woes,</li>
  <li>I come to tell you things sith then befall’n.</li>
  <li>After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,</li>
  <li>Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp,</li>
  <li>Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,</li>
  <li class="number">Were brought me of your loss and his depart.</li>
  <li>I, then in London keeper of the king,</li>
  <li>Muster’d my soldiers, gather’d flocks of friends,</li>
  <li>And very well appointed, as I thought,</li>
  <li>March’d toward Saint Alban’s to intercept the queen,</li>
  <li class="number">Bearing the king in my behalf along;</li>
  <li>For by my scouts I was advertised</li>
  <li>That she was coming with a full intent</li>
  <li>To dash our late decree in parliament</li>
  <li>Touching King Henry’s oath and your succession.</li>
  <li class="number">Short tale to make, we at Saint Alban’s met</li>
  <li>Our battles join’d, and both sides fiercely fought:</li>
  <li>But whether ’twas the coldness of the king,</li>
  <li>Who look’d full gently on his warlike queen,</li>
  <li>That robb’d my soldiers of their heated spleen;</li>
  <li class="number">Or whether ’twas report of her success;</li>
  <li>Or more than common fear of Clifford’s rigour,</li>
  <li>Who thunders to his captives blood and death,</li>
  <li>I cannot judge: but to conclude with truth,</li>
  <li>Their weapons like to lightning came and went;</li>
  <li class="number">Our soldiers’, like the night-owl’s lazy flight,</li>
  <li>Or like an idle thresher with a flail,</li>
  <li>Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.</li>
  <li>I cheer’d them up with justice of our cause,</li>
  <li>With promise of high pay and great rewards:</li>
  <li class="number">But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,</li>
  <li>And we in them no hope to win the day;</li>
  <li>So that we fled; the king unto the queen;</li>
  <li>Lord George your brother, Norfolk and myself,</li>
  <li>In haste, post-haste, are come to join with you:</li>
  <li class="number">For in the marches here we heard you were,</li>
  <li>Making another head to fight again.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EDWARD">
  <li>Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?</li>
  <li>And when came George from Burgundy to England?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>Some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers;</li>
  <li class="number">And for your brother, he was lately sent</li>
  <li>From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,</li>
  <li>With aid of soldiers to this needful war.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RICHARD">
  <li>’Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled:</li>
  <li>Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,</li>
  <li class="number">But ne’er till now his scandal of retire.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;</li>
  <li>For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine</li>
  <li>Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry’s head,</li>
  <li>And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,</li>
  <li class="number">Were he as famous and as bold in war</li>
  <li>As he is famed for mildness, peace, and prayer.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RICHARD">
  <li>I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not:</li>
  <li>’Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak.</li>
  <li>But in this troublous time what’s to be done?</li>
  <li class="number">Shall we go throw away our coats of steel,</li>
  <li>And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,</li>
  <li>Numbering our Ave-Maries with our beads?</li>
  <li>Or shall we on the helmets of our foes</li>
  <li>Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?</li>
  <li class="number">If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;</li>
  <li>And therefore comes my brother Montague.</li>
  <li>Attend me, lords. The proud insulting queen,</li>
  <li>With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,</li>
  <li class="number">And of their feather many more proud birds,</li>
  <li>Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.</li>
  <li>He swore consent to your succession,</li>
  <li>His oath enrolled in the parliament;</li>
  <li>And now to London all the crew are gone,</li>
  <li class="number">To frustrate both his oath and what beside</li>
  <li>May make against the house of Lancaster.</li>
  <li>Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong:</li>
  <li>Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself,</li>
  <li>With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March,</li>
  <li class="number">Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,</li>
  <li>Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,</li>
  <li>Why, Via! to London will we march amain,</li>
  <li>And once again bestride our foaming steeds,</li>
  <li>And once again cry ’Charge upon our foes!’</li>
  <li class="number">But never once again turn back and fly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RICHARD">
  <li>Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak:</li>
  <li>Ne’er may he live to see a sunshine day,</li>
  <li>That cries ’Retire,’ if Warwick bid him stay.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EDWARD">
  <li>Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean;</li>
  <li class="number">And when thou fail’st — as God forbid the hour! — </li>
  <li>Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forfend!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York:</li>
  <li>The next degree is England’s royal throne;</li>
  <li>For King of England shalt thou be proclaim’d</li>
  <li class="number">In every borough as we pass along;</li>
  <li>And he that throws not up his cap for joy</li>
  <li>Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head.</li>
  <li>King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague,</li>
  <li>Stay we no longer, dreaming of renown,</li>
  <li class="number">But sound the trumpets, and about our task.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RICHARD">
  <li>Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,</li>
  <li>As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds,</li>
  <li>I come to pierce it, or to give thee mine.</li>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN MARGARET">
  <li>Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York.</li>
  <li>Yonder’s the head of that arch-enemy</li>
  <li>That sought to be encompass’d with your crown:</li>
  <li>Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">
  <li class="number">Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck:</li>
  <li>To see this sight, it irks my very soul.</li>
  <li>Withhold revenge, dear God! ’tis not my fault,</li>
  <li>Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLIFFORD">
  <li>My gracious liege, this too much lenity</li>
  <li class="number">And harmful pity must be laid aside.</li>
  <li>To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?</li>
  <li>Not to the beast that would usurp their den.</li>
  <li>Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?</li>
  <li>Not his that spoils her young before her face.</li>
  <li class="number">Who ’scapes the lurking serpent’s mortal sting?</li>
  <li>Not he that sets his foot upon her back.</li>
  <li>The smallest worm will turn being trodden on,</li>
  <li>And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.</li>
  <li>Ambitious York doth level at thy crown,</li>
  <li class="number">Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows:</li>
  <li>He, but a duke, would have his son a king,</li>
  <li>And raise his issue, like a loving sire;</li>
  <li>Thou, being a king, blest with a goodly son,</li>
  <li>Didst yield consent to disinherit him,</li>
  <li class="number">Which argued thee a most unloving father.</li>
  <li>Unreasonable creatures feed their young;</li>
  <li>And though man’s face be fearful to their eyes,</li>
  <li>Yet, in protection of their tender ones,</li>
  <li>Who hath not seen them, even with those wings</li>
  <li class="number">Which sometime they have used with fearful flight,</li>
  <li>Make war with him that climb’d unto their nest,</li>
  <li>Offer their own lives in their young’s defence?</li>
  <li>For shame, my liege, make them your precedent!</li>
  <li>Were it not pity that this goodly boy</li>
  <li class="number">Should lose his birthright by his father’s fault,</li>
  <li>And long hereafter say unto his child,</li>
  <li>’What my great-grandfather and his grandsire got</li>
  <li>My careless father fondly gave away’?</li>
  <li>Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy;</li>

  <li>I’ll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind;</li>

  <li>For Warwick is a subtle orator,</li>
  <li>And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words.</li>
  <li class="number">By this account then Margaret may win him;</li>
  <li>For she’s a woman to be pitied much:</li>
  <li>Her sighs will make a battery in his breast;</li>
  <li>Her tears will pierce into a marble heart;</li>
  <li>The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn;</li>
  <li class="number">And Nero will be tainted with remorse,</li>
  <li>To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears.</li>
  <li>Ay, but she’s come to beg, Warwick to give;</li>
  <li>She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry,</li>
  <li>He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward.</li>
  <li class="number">She weeps, and says her Henry is deposed;</li>
  <li>He smiles, and says his Edward is install’d;</li>
  <li>That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more;</li>
  <li>Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,</li>
  <li>Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,</li>
  <li class="number">And in conclusion wins the king from her,</li>
  <li>With promise of his sister, and what else,</li>
  <li>To strengthen and support King Edward’s place.</li>
  <li>O Margaret, thus ’twill be; and thou, poor soul,</li>
  <li>Art then forsaken, as thou went’st forlorn!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Keeper">
  <li class="number">Say, what art thou that talk’st of kings and queens?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">
  <li>More than I seem, and less than I was born to:</li>
  <li>A man at least, for less I should not be;</li>
  <li>And men may talk of kings, and why not I?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Keeper">
  <li>Ay, but thou talk’st as if thou wert a king.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">
  <li class="number">Why, so I am, in mind; and that’s enough.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Keeper">
  <li>But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">
  <li>My crown is in my heart, not on my head;</li>
  <li>Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,</li>
  <li>Nor to be seen: my crown is called content:</li>
  <li class="number">A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Keeper">
  <li>Well, if you be a king crown’d with content,</li>
  <li>Your crown content and you must be contented</li>
  <li>To go along with us; for as we think,</li>
  <li>You are the king King Edward hath deposed;</li>
  <li class="number">And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance</li>
  <li>Will apprehend you as his enemy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">
  <li>But did you never swear, and break an oath?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Keeper">
  <li>No, never such an oath; nor will not now.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">
  <li>Where did you dwell when I was King of England?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Keeper">
  <li class="number">Here in this country, where we now remain.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">
  <li>I was anointed king at nine months old;</li>
  <li>My father and my grandfather were kings,</li>
  <li>And you were sworn true subjects unto me:</li>
  <li>And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Keeper">
  <li class="number">No;</li>
  <li>For we were subjects but while you were king.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">
  <li>Why, am I dead? do I not breathe a man?</li>
  <li>Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!</li>
  <li>Look, as I blow this feather from my face,</li>
  <li class="number">And as the air blows it to me again,</li>
  <li>Obeying with my wind when I do blow,</li>
  <li>And yielding to another when it blows,</li>
  <li>Commanded always by the greater gust;</li>
  <li>Such is the lightness of you common men.</li>
  <li class="number">But do not break your oaths; for of that sin</li>
  <li>My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.</li>
  <li>Go where you will, the king shall be commanded;</li>
  <li>And be you kings, command, and I’ll obey.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Keeper">
  <li>We are true subjects to the king, King Edward.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">
  <li class="number">So would you be again to Henry,</li>
  <li>If he were seated as King Edward is.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Keeper">
  <li>We charge you, in God’s name, and the king’s,</li>
  <li>To go with us unto the officers.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">
  <li>In God’s name, lead; your king’s name be obey’d:</li>
  <li class="number">And what God will, that let your king perform;</li>
  <li>And what he will, I humbly yield unto.</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  London. The palace.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and
LADY GREY</div>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li>Brother of Gloucester, at Saint Alban’s field</li>
  <li>This lady’s husband, Sir Richard Grey, was slain,</li>
  <li>His lands then seized on by the conqueror:</li>
  <li>Her suit is now to repossess those lands;</li>
  <li class="number">Which we in justice cannot well deny,</li>
  <li>Because in quarrel of the house of York</li>
  <li>The worthy gentleman did lose his life.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>Your highness shall do well to grant her suit;</li>
  <li>It were dishonour to deny it her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li class="number">It were no less; but yet I’ll make a pause.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li><stagedir>Aside to CLARENCE</stagedir>  Yea, is it so?</li>
  <li>I see the lady hath a thing to grant,</li>
  <li>Before the king will grant her humble suit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li><stagedir>Aside to GLOUCESTER</stagedir>  He knows the game: how true</li>
  <li class="number">he keeps the wind!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li><stagedir>Aside to CLARENCE</stagedir>  Silence!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li>Widow, we will consider of your suit;</li>
  <li>And come some other time to know our mind.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY GREY">
  <li>Right gracious lord, I cannot brook delay:</li>
  <li class="number">May it please your highness to resolve me now;</li>
  <li>And what your pleasure is, shall satisfy me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li><stagedir>Aside to CLARENCE</stagedir>  Ay, widow? then I’ll warrant</li>
  <li>you all your lands,</li>
  <li>An if what pleases him shall pleasure you.</li>
  <li class="number">Fight closer, or, good faith, you’ll catch a blow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li><stagedir>Aside to GLOUCESTER</stagedir>  I fear her not, unless she</li>
  <li>chance to fall.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li><stagedir>Aside to CLARENCE</stagedir> God forbid that! for he’ll</li>
  <li>take vantages.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li class="number">How many children hast thou, widow? tell me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li><stagedir>Aside to GLOUCESTER</stagedir>  I think he means to beg a</li>
  <li>child of her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li><stagedir>Aside to CLARENCE</stagedir>  Nay, whip me then: he’ll rather</li>
  <li>give her two.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY GREY">
  <li class="number">Three, my most gracious lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li><stagedir>Aside to CLARENCE</stagedir>  You shall have four, if you’ll</li>
  <li>be ruled by him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li>’Twere pity they should lose their father’s lands.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY GREY">
  <li>Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it then.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li class="number">Lords, give us leave: I’ll try this widow’s wit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li><stagedir>Aside to CLARENCE</stagedir>  Ay, good leave have you; for</li>
  <li>you will have leave,</li>
  <li>Till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">GLOUCESTER and CLARENCE retire</div>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li>Now tell me, madam, do you love your children?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY GREY">
  <li class="number">Ay, full as dearly as I love myself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li>And would you not do much to do them good?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY GREY">
  <li>To do them good, I would sustain some harm.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li>Then get your husband’s lands, to do them good.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY GREY">
  <li>Therefore I came unto your majesty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li class="number">I’ll tell you how these lands are to be got.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY GREY">
  <li>So shall you bind me to your highness’ service.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li>What service wilt thou do me, if I give them?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY GREY">
  <li>What you command, that rests in me to do.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li>But you will take exceptions to my boon.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY GREY">
  <li class="number">No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li>Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY GREY">
  <li>Why, then I will do what your grace commands.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li><stagedir>Aside to CLARENCE</stagedir>  He plies her hard; and much rain</li>
  <li>wears the marble.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li class="number"><stagedir>Aside to GLOUCESTER</stagedir>  As red as fire! nay, then</li>
  <li>her wax must melt.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY GREY">
  <li>Why stops my lord, shall I not hear my task?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li>An easy task; ’tis but to love a king.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY GREY">
  <li>That’s soon perform’d, because I am a subject.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li class="number">Why, then, thy husband’s lands I freely give thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY GREY">
  <li>I take my leave with many thousand thanks.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li><stagedir>Aside to CLARENCE</stagedir>  The match is made; she seals it</li>
  <li>with a curtsy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li>But stay thee, ’tis the fruits of love I mean.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY GREY">
  <li class="number">The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li>Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense.</li>
  <li>What love, think’st thou, I sue so much to get?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY GREY">
  <li>My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;</li>
  <li>That love which virtue begs and virtue grants.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li class="number">No, by my troth, I did not mean such love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY GREY">
  <li>Why, then you mean not as I thought you did.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li>But now you partly may perceive my mind.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY GREY">
  <li>My mind will never grant what I perceive</li>
  <li>Your highness aims at, if I aim aright.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li class="number">To tell thee plain, I aim to lie with thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY GREY">
  <li>To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li>Why, then thou shalt not have thy husband’s lands.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY GREY">
  <li>Why, then mine honesty shall be my dower;</li>
  <li>For by that loss I will not purchase them.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li class="number">Therein thou wrong’st thy children mightily.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY GREY">
  <li>Herein your highness wrongs both them and me.</li>
  <li>But, mighty lord, this merry inclination</li>
  <li>Accords not with the sadness of my suit:</li>
  <li>Please you dismiss me either with ’ay’ or ’no.’</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li class="number">Ay, if thou wilt say ’ay’ to my request;</li>
  <li>No if thou dost say ’no’ to my demand.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY GREY">
  <li>Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li><stagedir>Aside to CLARENCE</stagedir>  The widow likes him not, she</li>

  <li>All her perfections challenge sovereignty:</li>

  <li>And she shall be my love, or else my queen. — </li>
  <li>Say that King Edward take thee for his queen?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY GREY">
  <li>’Tis better said than done, my gracious lord:</li>
  <li>I am a subject fit to jest withal,</li>
  <li class="number">But far unfit to be a sovereign.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li>Sweet widow, by my state I swear to thee</li>
  <li>I speak no more than what my soul intends;</li>
  <li>And that is, to enjoy thee for my love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY GREY">
  <li>And that is more than I will yield unto:</li>
  <li class="number">I know I am too mean to be your queen,</li>
  <li>And yet too good to be your concubine.</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li>You cavil, widow: I did mean, my queen.</li>

<ol data-speaker="LADY GREY">
  <li>’Twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father.</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li>No more than when my daughters call thee mother.</li>
  <li class="number">Thou art a widow, and thou hast some children;</li>
  <li>And, by God’s mother, I, being but a bachelor,</li>
  <li>Have other some: why, ’tis a happy thing</li>

  <li>Answer no more, for thou shalt be my queen.</li>

  <li>I’ll make my heaven in a lady’s lap,</li>
  <li class="number">And deck my body in gay ornaments,</li>
  <li>And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.</li>
  <li>O miserable thought! and more unlikely</li>
  <li>Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns!</li>
  <li>Why, love forswore me in my mother’s womb:</li>
  <li class="number">And, for I should not deal in her soft laws,</li>
  <li>She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe,</li>
  <li>To shrink mine arm up like a wither’d shrub;</li>
  <li>To make an envious mountain on my back,</li>
  <li>Where sits deformity to mock my body;</li>
  <li class="number">To shape my legs of an unequal size;</li>
  <li>To disproportion me in every part,</li>
  <li>Like to a chaos, or an unlick’d bear-whelp</li>
  <li>That carries no impression like the dam.</li>
  <li>And am I then a man to be beloved?</li>
  <li class="number">O monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought!</li>
  <li>Then, since this earth affords no joy to me,</li>
  <li>But to command, to cheque, to o’erbear such</li>
  <li>As are of better person than myself,</li>
  <li>I’ll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,</li>
  <li class="number">And, whiles I live, to account this world but hell,</li>
  <li>Until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this head</li>
  <li>Be round impaled with a glorious crown.</li>
  <li>And yet I know not how to get the crown,</li>
  <li>For many lives stand between me and home:</li>
  <li class="number">And I — like one lost in a thorny wood,</li>
  <li>That rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns,</li>
  <li>Seeking a way and straying from the way;</li>
  <li>Not knowing how to find the open air,</li>
  <li>But toiling desperately to find it out — </li>
  <li class="number">Torment myself to catch the English crown:</li>
  <li>And from that torment I will free myself,</li>
  <li>Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.</li>
  <li>Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,</li>
  <li>And cry ’Content’ to that which grieves my heart,</li>
  <li class="number">And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,</li>
  <li>And frame my face to all occasions.</li>
  <li>I’ll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;</li>
  <li>I’ll slay more gazers than the basilisk;</li>
  <li>I’ll play the orator as well as Nestor,</li>
  <li class="number">Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,</li>
  <li>And, like a Sinon, take another Troy.</li>
  <li>I can add colours to the chameleon,</li>
  <li>Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,</li>
  <li>And set the murderous Machiavel to school.</li>
  <li class="number">Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?</li>
  <li>Tut, were it farther off, I’ll pluck it down.</li>

  <li>With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry’s heir,</li>
  <li>Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid;</li>
  <li>And if thou fail us, all our hope is done:</li>
  <li class="number">Scotland hath will to help, but cannot help;</li>
  <li>Our people and our peers are both misled,</li>
  <li>Our treasures seized, our soldiers put to flight,</li>
  <li>And, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING LEWIS XI">
  <li>Renowned queen, with patience calm the storm,</li>
  <li class="number">While we bethink a means to break it off.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN MARGARET">
  <li>The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING LEWIS XI">
  <li>The more I stay, the more I’ll succor thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN MARGARET">
  <li>O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow.</li>
  <li>And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter WARWICK</div>

<ol data-speaker="KING LEWIS XI">
  <li class="number">What’s he approacheth boldly to our presence?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN MARGARET">
  <li>Our Earl of Warwick, Edward’s greatest friend.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING LEWIS XI">
  <li>Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France?</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">He descends. She ariseth</div>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN MARGARET">
  <li>Ay, now begins a second storm to rise;</li>
  <li>For this is he that moves both wind and tide.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li class="number">From worthy Edward, King of Albion,</li>
  <li>My lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend,</li>
  <li>I come, in kindness and unfeigned love,</li>
  <li>First, to do greetings to thy royal person;</li>
  <li>And then to crave a league of amity;</li>
  <li class="number">And lastly, to confirm that amity</li>
  <li>With a nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant</li>
  <li>That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,</li>
  <li>To England’s king in lawful marriage.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN MARGARET">
  <li><span class="stage-direction">Aside</span>  If that go forward, Henry’s hope is done.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li class="number"><stagedir>To BONA</stagedir>  And, gracious madam, in our king’s behalf,</li>
  <li>I am commanded, with your leave and favour,</li>
  <li>Humbly to kiss your hand, and with my tongue</li>
  <li>To tell the passion of my sovereign’s heart;</li>
  <li>Where fame, late entering at his heedful ears,</li>
  <li class="number">Hath placed thy beauty’s image and thy virtue.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN MARGARET">
  <li>King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak,</li>
  <li>Before you answer Warwick. His demand</li>
  <li>Springs not from Edward’s well-meant honest love,</li>
  <li>But from deceit bred by necessity;</li>
  <li class="number">For how can tyrants safely govern home,</li>
  <li>Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?</li>
  <li>To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,</li>
  <li>That Henry liveth still: but were he dead,</li>
  <li>Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry’s son.</li>
  <li class="number">Look, therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage</li>
  <li>Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour;</li>
  <li>For though usurpers sway the rule awhile,</li>
  <li>Yet heavens are just, and time suppresseth wrongs.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>Injurious Margaret!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE EDWARD">
  <li class="number">And why not queen?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>Because thy father Henry did usurp;</li>
  <li>And thou no more are prince than she is queen.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OXFORD">
  <li>Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,</li>
  <li>Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain;</li>
  <li class="number">And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,</li>
  <li>Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;</li>
  <li>And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,</li>
  <li>Who by his prowess conquered all France:</li>
  <li>From these our Henry lineally descends.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li class="number">Oxford, how haps it, in this smooth discourse,</li>
  <li>You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost</li>
  <li>All that which Henry Fifth had gotten?</li>
  <li>Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.</li>
  <li>But for the rest, you tell a pedigree</li>
  <li class="number">Of threescore and two years; a silly time</li>
  <li>To make prescription for a kingdom’s worth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OXFORD">
  <li>Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,</li>
  <li>Whom thou obeyed’st thirty and six years,</li>
  <li>And not bewray thy treason with a blush?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li class="number">Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,</li>
  <li>Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?</li>
  <li>For shame! leave Henry, and call Edward king.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OXFORD">
  <li>Call him my king by whose injurious doom</li>
  <li>My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,</li>
  <li class="number">Was done to death? and more than so, my father,</li>
  <li>Even in the downfall of his mellow’d years,</li>
  <li>When nature brought him to the door of death?</li>
  <li>No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,</li>
  <li>This arm upholds the house of Lancaster.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li class="number">And I the house of York.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING LEWIS XI">
  <li>Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,</li>
  <li>Vouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside,</li>
  <li>While I use further conference with Warwick.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">They stand aloof</div>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN MARGARET">
  <li>Heavens grant that Warwick’s words bewitch him not!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING LEWIS XI">
  <li class="number">Now Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,</li>
  <li>Is Edward your true king? for I were loath</li>
  <li>To link with him that were not lawful chosen.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING LEWIS XI">
  <li>But is he gracious in the people’s eye?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li class="number">The more that Henry was unfortunate.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING LEWIS XI">
  <li>Then further, all dissembling set aside,</li>
  <li>Tell me for truth the measure of his love</li>
  <li>Unto our sister Bona.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>Such it seems</li>
  <li class="number">As may beseem a monarch like himself.</li>
  <li>Myself have often heard him say and swear</li>
  <li>That this his love was an eternal plant,</li>
  <li>Whereof the root was fix’d in virtue’s ground,</li>
  <li>The leaves and fruit maintain’d with beauty’s sun,</li>
  <li class="number">Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,</li>
  <li>Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING LEWIS XI">
  <li>Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BONA">
  <li>Your grant, or your denial, shall be mine:</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">To WARWICK</li>
  <li>Yet I confess that often ere this day,</li>
  <li class="number">When I have heard your king’s desert recounted,</li>
  <li>Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING LEWIS XI">
  <li>Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward’s;</li>
  <li>And now forthwith shall articles be drawn</li>
  <li>Touching the jointure that your king must make,</li>
  <li class="number">Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised.</li>
  <li>Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness</li>
  <li>That Bona shall be wife to the English king.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE EDWARD">
  <li>To Edward, but not to the English king.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN MARGARET">
  <li>Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device</li>
  <li class="number">By this alliance to make void my suit:</li>
  <li>Before thy coming Lewis was Henry’s friend.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING LEWIS XI">
  <li>And still is friend to him and Margaret:</li>
  <li>But if your title to the crown be weak,</li>
  <li>As may appear by Edward’s good success,</li>
  <li class="number">Then ’tis but reason that I be released</li>
  <li>From giving aid which late I promised.</li>
  <li>Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand</li>
  <li>That your estate requires and mine can yield.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,</li>
  <li class="number">Where having nothing, nothing can he lose.</li>
  <li>And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,</li>
  <li>You have a father able to maintain you;</li>
  <li>And better ’twere you troubled him than France.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN MARGARET">
  <li>Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, peace,</li>
  <li class="number">Proud setter up and puller down of kings!</li>
  <li>I will not hence, till, with my talk and tears,</li>
  <li>Both full of truth, I make King Lewis behold</li>
  <li>Thy sly conveyance and thy lord’s false love;</li>
  <li>For both of you are birds of selfsame feather.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Post blows a horn within</div>

  <li class="stage-direction">To QUEEN MARGARET</li>
  <li>And, madam, these for you; from whom I know not.</li>

<div class="stage-direction">They all read their letters</div>

<ol data-speaker="OXFORD">
  <li class="number">I like it well that our fair queen and mistress</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE EDWARD">
  <li>Nay, mark how Lewis stamps, as he were nettled:</li>
  <li>I hope all’s for the best.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING LEWIS XI">
  <li>Warwick, what are thy news? and yours, fair queen?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN MARGARET">
  <li class="number">Mine, such as fill my heart with unhoped joys.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>Mine, full of sorrow and heart’s discontent.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING LEWIS XI">
  <li>What! has your king married the Lady Grey!</li>
  <li>And now, to soothe your forgery and his,</li>
  <li>Sends me a paper to persuade me patience?</li>
  <li class="number">Is this the alliance that he seeks with France?</li>
  <li>Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN MARGARET">
  <li>I told your majesty as much before:</li>
  <li>This proveth Edward’s love and Warwick’s honesty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>King Lewis, I here protest, in sight of heaven,</li>
  <li class="number">And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,</li>
  <li>That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward’s,</li>
  <li>No more my king, for he dishonours me,</li>
  <li>But most himself, if he could see his shame.</li>
  <li>Did I forget that by the house of York</li>
  <li class="number">My father came untimely to his death?</li>
  <li>Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece?</li>
  <li>Did I impale him with the regal crown?</li>
  <li>Did I put Henry from his native right?</li>
  <li>And am I guerdon’d at the last with shame?</li>
  <li class="number">Shame on himself! for my desert is honour:</li>
  <li>And to repair my honour lost for him,</li>
  <li>I here renounce him and return to Henry.</li>
  <li>My noble queen, let former grudges pass,</li>
  <li>And henceforth I am thy true servitor:</li>
  <li class="number">I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona,</li>
  <li>And replant Henry in his former state.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN MARGARET">
  <li>Warwick, these words have turn’d my hate to love;</li>
  <li>And I forgive and quite forget old faults,</li>
  <li>And joy that thou becomest King Henry’s friend.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li class="number">So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,</li>
  <li>That, if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us</li>
  <li>With some few bands of chosen soldiers,</li>
  <li>I’ll undertake to land them on our coast</li>
  <li>And force the tyrant from his seat by war.</li>
  <li class="number">’Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him:</li>
  <li>And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,</li>
  <li>He’s very likely now to fall from him,</li>
  <li>For matching more for wanton lust than honour,</li>
  <li>Or than for strength and safety of our country.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BONA">
  <li class="number">Dear brother, how shall Bona be revenged</li>
  <li>But by thy help to this distressed queen?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN MARGARET">
  <li>Renowned prince, how shall poor Henry live,</li>
  <li>Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BONA">
  <li>My quarrel and this English queen’s are one.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li class="number">And mine, fair lady Bona, joins with yours.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING LEWIS XI">
  <li>And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret’s.</li>
  <li>Therefore at last I firmly am resolved</li>
  <li>You shall have aid.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN MARGARET">
  <li>Let me give humble thanks for all at once.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING LEWIS XI">
  <li class="number">Then, England’s messenger, return in post,</li>
  <li>And tell false Edward, thy supposed king,</li>
  <li>That Lewis of France is sending over masquers</li>
  <li>To revel it with him and his new bride:</li>
  <li>Thou seest what’s past, go fear thy king withal.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BONA">
  <li class="number">Tell him, in hope he’ll prove a widower shortly,</li>
  <li>I’ll wear the willow garland for his sake.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN MARGARET">
  <li>Tell him, my mourning weeds are laid aside,</li>
  <li>And I am ready to put armour on.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,</li>
  <li class="number">And therefore I’ll uncrown him ere’t be long.</li>
  <li>There’s thy reward: be gone.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit Post</div>

<ol data-speaker="KING LEWIS XI">
  <li>But, Warwick,</li>
  <li>Thou and Oxford, with five thousand men,</li>
  <li>Shall cross the seas, and bid false Edward battle;</li>
  <li class="number">And, as occasion serves, this noble queen</li>
  <li>And prince shall follow with a fresh supply.</li>
  <li>Yet, ere thou go, but answer me one doubt,</li>
  <li>What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>This shall assure my constant loyalty,</li>
  <li class="number">That if our queen and this young prince agree,</li>
  <li>I’ll join mine eldest daughter and my joy</li>
  <li>To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN MARGARET">
  <li>Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion.</li>
  <li>Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous,</li>
  <li class="number">Therefore delay not, give thy hand to Warwick;</li>
  <li>And, with thy hand, thy faith irrevocable,</li>
  <li>That only Warwick’s daughter shall be thine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE EDWARD">
  <li>Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it;</li>
  <li>And here, to pledge my vow, I give my hand.</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li>Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice,</li>
  <li class="number">That you stand pensive, as half malcontent?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li>As well as Lewis of France, or the Earl of Warwick,</li>
  <li>Which are so weak of courage and in judgment</li>
  <li>That they’ll take no offence at our abuse.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li>Suppose they take offence without a cause,</li>
  <li class="number">They are but Lewis and Warwick: I am Edward,</li>
  <li>Your king and Warwick’s, and must have my will.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>And shall have your will, because our king:</li>
  <li>Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li>Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li class="number">Not I:</li>
  <li>No, God forbid that I should wish them sever’d</li>
  <li>Whom God hath join’d together; ay, and ’twere pity</li>
  <li>To sunder them that yoke so well together.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li>Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,</li>

  <li>And you too, Somerset and Montague,</li>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li>Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis</li>

  <li>About the marriage of the Lady Bona.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge,</li>
  <li>Is now dishonoured by this new marriage.</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li>What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeased</li>
  <li class="number">By such invention as I can devise?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MONTAGUE">
  <li>Yet, to have join’d with France in such alliance</li>
  <li>Would more have strengthen’d this our commonwealth</li>
  <li>’Gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HASTINGS">
  <li>Why, knows not Montague that of itself</li>
  <li class="number">England is safe, if true within itself?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MONTAGUE">
  <li>But the safer when ’tis back’d with France.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HASTINGS">
  <li>’Tis better using France than trusting France:</li>
  <li>Let us be back’d with God and with the seas</li>
  <li>Which He hath given for fence impregnable,</li>

  <li>In them and in ourselves our safety lies.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li>For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves</li>
  <li>To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li>Ay, what of that? it was my will and grant;</li>
  <li class="number">And for this once my will shall stand for law.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>And yet methinks your grace hath not done well,</li>
  <li>To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales</li>
  <li>Unto the brother of your loving bride;</li>
  <li>She better would have fitted me or Clarence:</li>
  <li class="number">But in your bride you bury brotherhood.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li>Or else you would not have bestow’d the heir</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li>In choosing for yourself, you show’d your judgment,</li>

  <li class="number">Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them.</li>
  <li>What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Post">
  <li>At my depart, these were his very words:</li>
  <li>’Go tell false Edward, thy supposed king,</li>
  <li>That Lewis of France is sending over masquers</li>
  <li class="number">To revel it with him and his new bride.’</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li>Is Lewis so brave? belike he thinks me Henry.</li>
  <li>But what said Lady Bona to my marriage?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Post">
  <li>These were her words, utter’d with mad disdain:</li>
  <li>’Tell him, in hope he’ll prove a widower shortly,</li>
  <li class="number">I’ll wear the willow garland for his sake.’</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li>I blame not her, she could say little less;</li>
  <li>She had the wrong. But what said Henry’s queen?</li>
  <li>For I have heard that she was there in place.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Post">
  <li>’Tell him,’ quoth she, ’my mourning weeds are done,</li>
  <li class="number">And I am ready to put armour on.’</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li>Belike she minds to play the Amazon.</li>
  <li>But what said Warwick to these injuries?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Post">
  <li>He, more incensed against your majesty</li>
  <li>Than all the rest, discharged me with these words:</li>
  <li class="number">’Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,</li>
  <li>And therefore I’ll uncrown him ere’t be long.’</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li>Ha! durst the traitor breathe out so proud words?</li>
  <li>Well I will arm me, being thus forewarn’d:</li>
  <li>They shall have wars and pay for their presumption.</li>
  <li class="number">But say, is Warwick friends with Margaret?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Post">
  <li>Ay, gracious sovereign; they are so link’d in</li>
  <li>friendship</li>
  <li>That young Prince Edward marries Warwick’s daughter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li>Belike the elder; Clarence will have the younger.</li>
  <li class="number">Now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast,</li>
  <li>For I will hence to Warwick’s other daughter;</li>
  <li>That, though I want a kingdom, yet in marriage</li>
  <li>I may not prove inferior to yourself.</li>
  <li>You that love me and Warwick, follow me.</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li>Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick!</li>
  <li>Yet am I arm’d against the worst can happen;</li>

  <li>Pembroke and Stafford, you in our behalf</li>
  <li>Go levy men, and make prepare for war;</li>
  <li>They are already, or quickly will be landed:</li>
  <li>Myself in person will straight follow you.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exeunt PEMBROKE and STAFFORD</li>
  <li class="number">But, ere I go, Hastings and Montague,</li>
  <li>Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,</li>

  <li>Tell me if you love Warwick more than me?</li>
  <li>If it be so, then both depart to him;</li>
  <li class="number">I rather wish you foes than hollow friends:</li>
  <li>But if you mind to hold your true obedience,</li>

  <li>I mean, in bearing weight of government,</li>

  <li>Why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li>When we grow stronger, then we’ll make our claim:</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li class="number">Then be it as you will; for ’tis my right,</li>

  <li class="number">Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest,</li>
  <li>Counting myself but bad till I be best.</li>
  <li>I’ll throw thy body in another room</li>
  <li>And triumph, Henry, in thy day of doom.</li>

<h3>SCENE VII.  London. The palace.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV, QUEEN ELIZABETH,
CLARENCE, GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, a Nurse with the
young Prince, and Attendants</div>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li>Once more we sit in England’s royal throne,</li>
  <li>Re-purchased with the blood of enemies.</li>
  <li>What valiant foemen, like to autumn’s corn,</li>
  <li>Have we mow’d down, in tops of all their pride!</li>
  <li class="number">Three Dukes of Somerset, threefold renown’d</li>
  <li>For hardy and undoubted champions;</li>
  <li>Two Cliffords, as the father and the son,</li>
  <li>And two Northumberlands; two braver men</li>
  <li>Ne’er spurr’d their coursers at the trumpet’s sound;</li>
  <li class="number">With them, the two brave bears, Warwick and Montague,</li>
  <li>That in their chains fetter’d the kingly lion</li>
  <li>And made the forest tremble when they roar’d.</li>
  <li>Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat</li>
  <li>And made our footstool of security.</li>
  <li class="number">Come hither, Bess, and let me kiss my boy.</li>
  <li>Young Ned, for thee, thine uncles and myself</li>
  <li>Have in our armours watch’d the winter’s night,</li>
  <li>Went all afoot in summer’s scalding heat,</li>
  <li>That thou mightst repossess the crown in peace;</li>
  <li class="number">And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li><span class="stage-direction">Aside</span>  I’ll blast his harvest, if your head were laid;</li>
  <li>For yet I am not look’d on in the world.</li>
  <li>This shoulder was ordain’d so thick to heave;</li>
  <li>And heave it shall some weight, or break my back:</li>
  <li class="number">Work thou the way — and thou shalt execute.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li>Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen;</li>
  <li>And kiss your princely nephew, brothers both.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li>The duty that I owe unto your majesty</li>
  <li>I seal upon the lips of this sweet babe.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN ELIZABETH">
  <li class="number">Thanks, noble Clarence; worthy brother, thanks.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>And, that I love the tree from whence thou sprang’st,</li>
  <li>Witness the loving kiss I give the fruit.</li>
  <li><span class="stage-direction">Aside</span>  To say the truth, so Judas kiss’d his master,</li>
  <li>And cried ’all hail!’ when as he meant all harm.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li class="number">Now am I seated as my soul delights,</li>
  <li>Having my country’s peace and brothers’ loves.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLARENCE">
  <li>What will your grace have done with Margaret?</li>
  <li>Reignier, her father, to the king of France</li>
  <li>Hath pawn’d the Sicils and Jerusalem,</li>
  <li class="number">And hither have they sent it for her ransom.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD IV">
  <li>Away with her, and waft her hence to France.</li>
  <li>And now what rests but that we spend the time</li>
  <li>With stately triumphs, mirthful comic shows,</li>
  <li>Such as befits the pleasure of the court?</li>
  <li class="number">Sound drums and trumpets! farewell sour annoy!</li>
  <li>For here, I hope, begins our lasting joy.</li>
</ol>
