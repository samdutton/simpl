<h3>SCENE I.  Venice. A street.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter RODERIGO and IAGO</div>

<ol data-speaker="RODERIGO">
  <li>Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly</li>
  <li>That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse</li>
  <li>As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>’Sblood, but you will not hear me:</li>
  <li class="number">If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RODERIGO">
  <li>Thou told’st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,</li>
  <li>In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,</li>
  <li>Off-capp’d to him: and, by the faith of man,</li>
  <li class="number">I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:</li>
  <li>But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,</li>
  <li>Evades them, with a bombast circumstance</li>
  <li>Horribly stuff’d with epithets of war;</li>
  <li>And, in conclusion,</li>
  <li class="number">Nonsuits my mediators; for, ’Certes,’ says he,</li>
  <li>’I have already chose my officer.’</li>
  <li>And what was he?</li>
  <li>Forsooth, a great arithmetician,</li>
  <li>One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,</li>
  <li class="number">A fellow almost damn’d in a fair wife;</li>
  <li>That never set a squadron in the field,</li>
  <li>Nor the division of a battle knows</li>
  <li>More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,</li>
  <li>Wherein the toged consuls can propose</li>
  <li class="number">As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,</li>
  <li>Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:</li>
  <li>And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof</li>
  <li>At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds</li>
  <li>Christian and heathen, must be be-lee’d and calm’d</li>
  <li class="number">By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,</li>
  <li>He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,</li>
  <li>And I — God bless the mark! — his Moorship’s ancient.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RODERIGO">
  <li>By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>Why, there’s no remedy; ’tis the curse of service,</li>
  <li class="number">Preferment goes by letter and affection,</li>
  <li>And not by old gradation, where each second</li>
  <li>Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,</li>
  <li>Whether I in any just term am affined</li>
  <li>To love the Moor.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RODERIGO">
  <li class="number">I would not follow him then.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>O, sir, content you;</li>
  <li>I follow him to serve my turn upon him:</li>
  <li>We cannot all be masters, nor all masters</li>
  <li>Cannot be truly follow’d. You shall mark</li>
  <li class="number">Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,</li>
  <li>That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,</li>
  <li>Wears out his time, much like his master’s ass,</li>
  <li>For nought but provender, and when he’s old, cashier’d:</li>
  <li>Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are</li>
  <li class="number">Who, trimm’d in forms and visages of duty,</li>
  <li>Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,</li>
  <li>And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,</li>
  <li>Do well thrive by them and when they have lined</li>
  <li>their coats</li>
  <li class="number">Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;</li>
  <li>And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,</li>
  <li>It is as sure as you are Roderigo,</li>
  <li>Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:</li>
  <li>In following him, I follow but myself;</li>
  <li class="number">Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,</li>
  <li>But seeming so, for my peculiar end:</li>
  <li>For when my outward action doth demonstrate</li>
  <li>The native act and figure of my heart</li>
  <li>In compliment extern, ’tis not long after</li>
  <li class="number">But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve</li>
  <li>For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RODERIGO">
  <li>What a full fortune does the thicklips owe</li>
  <li>If he can carry’t thus!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>Call up her father,</li>
  <li class="number">Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,</li>
  <li>Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,</li>
  <li>And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,</li>
  <li>Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,</li>
  <li>Yet throw such changes of vexation on’t,</li>
  <li class="number">As it may lose some colour.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RODERIGO">
  <li>Here is her father’s house; I’ll call aloud.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell</li>
  <li>As when, by night and negligence, the fire</li>
  <li>Is spied in populous cities.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RODERIGO">
  <li class="number">What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>Awake! what, ho, Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves!</li>
  <li>Look to your house, your daughter and your bags!</li>
  <li>Thieves! thieves!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">BRABANTIO appears above, at a window</div>

<ol data-speaker="BRABANTIO">
  <li>What is the reason of this terrible summons?</li>
  <li class="number">What is the matter there?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RODERIGO">
  <li>Signior, is all your family within?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>Are your doors lock’d?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRABANTIO">
  <li>Why, wherefore ask you this?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>’Zounds, sir, you’re robb’d; for shame, put on</li>
  <li class="number">your gown;</li>
  <li>Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;</li>
  <li>Even now, now, very now, an old black ram</li>
  <li>Is topping your white ewe. Arise, arise;</li>
  <li>Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,</li>
  <li class="number">Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:</li>
  <li>Arise, I say.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRABANTIO">
  <li>What, have you lost your wits?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RODERIGO">
  <li>Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRABANTIO">
  <li>Not I what are you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RODERIGO">
  <li class="number">My name is Roderigo.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRABANTIO">
  <li>The worser welcome:</li>
  <li>I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:</li>
  <li>In honest plainness thou hast heard me say</li>
  <li>My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,</li>
  <li class="number">Being full of supper and distempering draughts,</li>
  <li>Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come</li>
  <li>To start my quiet.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RODERIGO">
  <li>Sir, sir, sir — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRABANTIO">
  <li>But thou must needs be sure</li>
  <li class="number">My spirit and my place have in them power</li>
  <li>To make this bitter to thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RODERIGO">
  <li>Patience, good sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRABANTIO">
  <li>What tell’st thou me of robbing? this is Venice;</li>
  <li>My house is not a grange.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RODERIGO">
  <li class="number">Most grave Brabantio,</li>
  <li>In simple and pure soul I come to you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>’Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not</li>
  <li>serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to</li>
  <li>do you service and you think we are ruffians, you’ll</li>
  <li class="number">have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse;</li>
  <li>you’ll have your nephews neigh to you; you’ll have</li>
  <li>coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRABANTIO">
  <li>What profane wretch art thou?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter</li>
  <li class="number">and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRABANTIO">
  <li>Thou art a villain.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>You are — a senator.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRABANTIO">
  <li>This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RODERIGO">
  <li>Sir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you,</li>
  <li class="number">If’t be your pleasure and most wise consent,</li>
  <li>As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,</li>
  <li>At this odd-even and dull watch o’ the night,</li>
  <li>Transported, with no worse nor better guard</li>
  <li>But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,</li>
  <li class="number">To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor — </li>
  <li>If this be known to you and your allowance,</li>
  <li>We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;</li>
  <li>But if you know not this, my manners tell me</li>
  <li>We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe</li>
  <li class="number">That, from the sense of all civility,</li>
  <li>I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:</li>
  <li>Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,</li>
  <li>I say again, hath made a gross revolt;</li>
  <li>Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes</li>
  <li class="number">In an extravagant and wheeling stranger</li>
  <li>Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:</li>
  <li>If she be in her chamber or your house,</li>
  <li>Let loose on me the justice of the state</li>
  <li>For thus deluding you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRABANTIO">
  <li class="number">Strike on the tinder, ho!</li>
  <li>Give me a taper! call up all my people!</li>
  <li>This accident is not unlike my dream:</li>
  <li>Belief of it oppresses me already.</li>
  <li>Light, I say! light!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit above</div>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li class="number">Farewell; for I must leave you:</li>
  <li>It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,</li>
  <li>To be produced — as, if I stay, I shall — </li>
  <li>Against the Moor: for, I do know, the state,</li>
  <li>However this may gall him with some cheque,</li>
  <li class="number">Cannot with safety cast him, for he’s embark’d</li>
  <li>With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,</li>
  <li>Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls,</li>
  <li>Another of his fathom they have none,</li>
  <li>To lead their business: in which regard,</li>
  <li class="number">Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains.</li>
  <li>Yet, for necessity of present life,</li>
  <li>I must show out a flag and sign of love,</li>
  <li>Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,</li>
  <li>Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;</li>
  <li class="number">And there will I be with him. So, farewell.</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter, below, BRABANTIO, and Servants with torches</div>

<ol data-speaker="BRABANTIO">
  <li>It is too true an evil: gone she is;</li>
  <li>And what’s to come of my despised time</li>
  <li>Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,</li>
  <li>Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!</li>
  <li class="number">With the Moor, say’st thou? Who would be a father!</li>
  <li>How didst thou know ’twas she? O she deceives me</li>
  <li>Past thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers:</li>
  <li>Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RODERIGO">
  <li>Truly, I think they are.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRABANTIO">
  <li class="number">O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!</li>
  <li>Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters’ minds</li>
  <li>By what you see them act. Is there not charms</li>
  <li>By which the property of youth and maidhood</li>
  <li>May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,</li>
  <li class="number">Of some such thing?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RODERIGO">
  <li>Yes, sir, I have indeed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRABANTIO">
  <li>Call up my brother. O, would you had had her!</li>
  <li>Some one way, some another. Do you know</li>
  <li>Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RODERIGO">
  <li class="number">I think I can discover him, if you please,</li>
  <li>To get good guard and go along with me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRABANTIO">
  <li>Pray you, lead on. At every house I’ll call;</li>
  <li>I may command at most. Get weapons, ho!</li>
  <li>And raise some special officers of night.</li>
  <li class="number">On, good Roderigo: I’ll deserve your pains.</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  Another street.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter OTHELLO, IAGO, and Attendants with torches</div>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>Though in the trade of war I have slain men,</li>
  <li>Yet do I hold it very stuff o’ the conscience</li>
  <li>To do no contrived murder: I lack iniquity</li>
  <li>Sometimes to do me service: nine or ten times</li>
  <li class="number">I had thought to have yerk’d him here under the ribs.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>’Tis better as it is.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>Nay, but he prated,</li>
  <li>And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms</li>
  <li>Against your honour</li>
  <li class="number">That, with the little godliness I have,</li>
  <li>I did full hard forbear him. But, I pray you, sir,</li>
  <li>Are you fast married? Be assured of this,</li>
  <li>That the magnifico is much beloved,</li>
  <li>And hath in his effect a voice potential</li>
  <li class="number">As double as the duke’s: he will divorce you;</li>
  <li>Or put upon you what restraint and grievance</li>
  <li>The law, with all his might to enforce it on,</li>
  <li>Will give him cable.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>Let him do his spite:</li>
  <li class="number">My services which I have done the signiory</li>
  <li>Shall out-tongue his complaints. ’Tis yet to know — </li>
  <li>Which, when I know that boasting is an honour,</li>
  <li>I shall promulgate — I fetch my life and being</li>
  <li>From men of royal siege, and my demerits</li>
  <li class="number">May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune</li>
  <li>As this that I have reach’d: for know, Iago,</li>
  <li>But that I love the gentle Desdemona,</li>
  <li>I would not my unhoused free condition</li>
  <li>Put into circumscription and confine</li>
  <li class="number">For the sea’s worth. But, look! what lights come yond?</li>

  <li>What is the news?</li>

  <li class="number">The duke does greet you, general,</li>

  <li>Even on the instant.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>What is the matter, think you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CASSIO">
  <li>Something from Cyprus as I may divine:</li>
  <li class="number">It is a business of some heat: the galleys</li>
  <li>Have sent a dozen sequent messengers</li>
  <li>This very night at one another’s heels,</li>
  <li>And many of the consuls, raised and met,</li>
  <li>Are at the duke’s already: you have been</li>
  <li class="number">hotly call’d for;</li>
  <li>When, being not at your lodging to be found,</li>
  <li>The senate hath sent about three several guests</li>
  <li>To search you out.</li>

<ol data-speaker="BRABANTIO">
  <li class="number">O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow’d my daughter?</li>
  <li>Damn’d as thou art, thou hast enchanted her;</li>
  <li>For I’ll refer me to all things of sense,</li>
  <li>If she in chains of magic were not bound,</li>
  <li>Whether a maid so tender, fair and happy,</li>
  <li class="number">So opposite to marriage that she shunned</li>
  <li>The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,</li>
  <li>Would ever have, to incur a general mock,</li>
  <li>Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom</li>
  <li>Of such a thing as thou, to fear, not to delight.</li>
  <li class="number">Judge me the world, if ’tis not gross in sense</li>
  <li>That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,</li>
  <li>Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals</li>
  <li>That weaken motion: I’ll have’t disputed on;</li>
  <li>’Tis probable and palpable to thinking.</li>
  <li class="number">I therefore apprehend and do attach thee</li>
  <li>For an abuser of the world, a practiser</li>
  <li>Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.</li>
  <li>Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,</li>

  <li>Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,</li>
  <li>My very noble and approved good masters,</li>
  <li>That I have ta’en away this old man’s daughter,</li>
  <li>It is most true; true, I have married her:</li>
  <li class="number">The very head and front of my offending</li>
  <li>Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,</li>
  <li>And little bless’d with the soft phrase of peace:</li>
  <li>For since these arms of mine had seven years’ pith,</li>
  <li>Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used</li>
  <li class="number">Their dearest action in the tented field,</li>
  <li>And little of this great world can I speak,</li>
  <li>More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,</li>
  <li>And therefore little shall I grace my cause</li>
  <li>In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,</li>
  <li class="number">I will a round unvarnish’d tale deliver</li>
  <li>Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,</li>
  <li>What conjuration and what mighty magic,</li>
  <li>For such proceeding I am charged withal,</li>
  <li>I won his daughter.</li>

  <li>Of years, of country, credit, every thing,</li>
  <li>To fall in love with what she fear’d to look on!</li>
  <li class="number">It is a judgment maim’d and most imperfect</li>
  <li>That will confess perfection so could err</li>
  <li>Against all rules of nature, and must be driven</li>
  <li>To find out practises of cunning hell,</li>
  <li>Why this should be. I therefore vouch again</li>
  <li class="number">That with some mixtures powerful o’er the blood,</li>
  <li>Or with some dram conjured to this effect,</li>
  <li>He wrought upon her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE OF VENICE">
  <li>To vouch this, is no proof,</li>

  <li>From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,</li>
  <li class="number">That I have passed.</li>
  <li>I ran it through, even from my boyish days,</li>
  <li>To the very moment that he bade me tell it;</li>
  <li>Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,</li>
  <li>Of moving accidents by flood and field</li>
  <li class="number">Of hair-breadth scapes i’ the imminent deadly breach,</li>
  <li>Of being taken by the insolent foe</li>

  <li>Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,</li>
  <li class="number">Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven</li>
  <li>It was my hint to speak — such was the process;</li>
  <li>And of the Cannibals that each other eat,</li>
  <li>The Anthropophagi and men whose heads</li>
  <li>Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear</li>
  <li class="number">Would Desdemona seriously incline:</li>
  <li>But still the house-affairs would draw her thence:</li>
  <li>Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,</li>
  <li>She’ld come again, and with a greedy ear</li>
  <li>Devour up my discourse: which I observing,</li>
  <li class="number">Took once a pliant hour, and found good means</li>
  <li>To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart</li>
  <li>That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,</li>
  <li>Whereof by parcels she had something heard,</li>
  <li>But not intentively: I did consent,</li>
  <li class="number">And often did beguile her of her tears,</li>
  <li>When I did speak of some distressful stroke</li>
  <li>That my youth suffer’d. My story being done,</li>
  <li>She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:</li>
  <li>She swore, in faith, twas strange, ’twas passing strange,</li>
  <li class="number">’Twas pitiful, ’twas wondrous pitiful:</li>
  <li>She wish’d she had not heard it, yet she wish’d</li>
  <li>That heaven had made her such a man: she thank’d me,</li>
  <li>And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,</li>
  <li>I should but teach him how to tell my story.</li>
  <li class="number">And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:</li>
  <li>She loved me for the dangers I had pass’d,</li>
  <li>And I loved her that she did pity them.</li>

  <li class="number">money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in</li>
  <li>their wills: fill thy purse with money: — the food</li>
  <li>that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be</li>
  <li>to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must</li>
  <li>change for youth: when she is sated with his body,</li>
  <li class="number">she will find the error of her choice: she must</li>
  <li>have change, she must: therefore put money in thy</li>
  <li>purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a</li>
  <li>more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money</li>
  <li>thou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt</li>
  <li class="number">an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian not</li>
  <li>too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou</li>
  <li>shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of</li>
  <li>drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek</li>
  <li>thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than</li>
  <li class="number">to be drowned and go without her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RODERIGO">
  <li>Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on</li>
  <li>the issue?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>Thou art sure of me: — go, make money: — I have told</li>
  <li>thee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I</li>
  <li class="number">hate the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath no</li>
  <li>less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge</li>
  <li>against him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost</li>
  <li>thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many</li>
  <li>events in the womb of time which will be delivered.</li>
  <li class="number">Traverse! go, provide thy money. We will have more</li>
  <li>of this to-morrow. Adieu.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RODERIGO">
  <li>Where shall we meet i’ the morning?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>At my lodging.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RODERIGO">
  <li>I’ll be with thee betimes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li class="number">Go to; farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RODERIGO">
  <li>What say you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>No more of drowning, do you hear?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RODERIGO">
  <li>I am changed: I’ll go sell all my land.</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>Thus do I ever make my fool my purse:</li>

  <li>He has done my office: I know not if’t be true;</li>
  <li class="number">But I, for mere suspicion in that kind,</li>
  <li>Will do as if for surety. He holds me well;</li>

  <li class="number">Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land;</li>
  <li>A fuller blast ne’er shook our battlements:</li>
  <li>If it hath ruffian’d so upon the sea,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Gentleman">
  <li class="number">A segregation of the Turkish fleet:</li>
  <li>For do but stand upon the foaming shore,</li>
  <li>The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds;</li>
  <li>The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane,</li>
  <li>seems to cast water on the burning bear,</li>
  <li class="number">And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole:</li>
  <li>I never did like molestation view</li>
  <li>On the enchafed flood.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MONTANO">
  <li>If that the Turkish fleet</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter a third Gentleman</div>

<ol data-speaker="Third Gentleman">
  <li>News, lads! our wars are done.</li>
  <li>The desperate tempest hath so bang’d the Turks,</li>

  <li class="number">On most part of their fleet.</li>

<ol data-speaker="MONTANO">
  <li>How! is this true?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Third Gentleman">
  <li>The ship is here put in,</li>
  <li>A Veronesa; Michael Cassio,</li>
  <li>Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MONTANO">
  <li>I am glad on’t; ’tis a worthy governor.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Third Gentleman">
  <li>But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort</li>
  <li>Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly,</li>
  <li class="number">And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted</li>
  <li>With foul and violent tempest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MONTANO">
  <li>Pray heavens he be;</li>
  <li>For I have served him, and the man commands</li>

  <li class="number">As well to see the vessel that’s come in</li>
  <li>As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Third Gentleman">
  <li>Come, let’s do so:</li>

  <li>Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MONTANO">
  <li>Is he well shipp’d?</li>

<ol data-speaker="CASSIO">
  <li>His bark is stoutly timber’d, his pilot</li>

<ol data-speaker="Second Gentleman">
  <li>’Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.</li>

<ol data-speaker="CASSIO">

  <li>That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,</li>

  <li>I thank you, valiant Cassio.</li>

  <li>Sir, would she give you so much of her lips</li>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li>Alas, she has no speech.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li class="number">In faith, too much;</li>
  <li>I find it still, when I have list to sleep:</li>
  <li>Marry, before your ladyship, I grant,</li>
  <li>She puts her tongue a little in her heart,</li>
  <li>And chides with thinking.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EMILIA">
  <li class="number">You have little cause to say so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>Come on, come on; you are pictures out of doors,</li>
  <li>Bells in your parlors, wild-cats in your kitchens,</li>
  <li>Saints m your injuries, devils being offended,</li>
  <li>Players in your housewifery, and housewives’ in your beds.</li>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li class="number">O, fie upon thee, slanderer!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk:</li>
  <li>You rise to play and go to bed to work.</li>

  <li>You shall not write my praise.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>No, let me not.</li>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li class="number">What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst</li>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>O gentle lady, do not put me to’t;</li>
  <li>For I am nothing, if not critical.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li>Come on assay. There’s one gone to the harbour?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li class="number">Ay, madam.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li>I am not merry; but I do beguile</li>
  <li>The thing I am, by seeming otherwise.</li>
  <li>Come, how wouldst thou praise me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>I am about it; but indeed my invention</li>
  <li class="number">Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize;</li>
  <li>It plucks out brains and all: but my Muse labours,</li>
  <li>And thus she is deliver’d.</li>
  <li>If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,</li>
  <li>The one’s for use, the other useth it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li class="number">Well praised! How if she be black and witty?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>If she be black, and thereto have a wit,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li>Worse and worse.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EMILIA">
  <li>How if fair and foolish?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li class="number">She never yet was foolish that was fair;</li>
  <li>For even her folly help’d her to an heir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li>These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i’</li>
  <li>the alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou for</li>
  <li>her that’s foul and foolish?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li class="number">There’s none so foul and foolish thereunto,</li>
  <li>But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li>O heavy ignorance! thou praisest the worst best.</li>
  <li>But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving</li>
  <li>woman indeed, one that, in the authority of her</li>
  <li class="number">merit, did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>She that was ever fair and never proud,</li>
  <li>Had tongue at will and yet was never loud,</li>
  <li>Never lack’d gold and yet went never gay,</li>
  <li>Fled from her wish and yet said ’Now I may,’</li>
  <li class="number">She that being anger’d, her revenge being nigh,</li>
  <li>Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly,</li>
  <li>She that in wisdom never was so frail</li>
  <li>To change the cod’s head for the salmon’s tail;</li>
  <li>She that could think and ne’er disclose her mind,</li>
  <li class="number">See suitors following and not look behind,</li>
  <li>She was a wight, if ever such wight were — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li>To do what?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li>O most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learn</li>

<ol data-speaker="CASSIO">

  <li>You say true; ’tis so, indeed: if such tricks as</li>

  <li>If after every tempest come such calms,</li>

  <li>Amen to that, sweet powers!</li>
  <li>I cannot speak enough of this content;</li>

  <li>Come, let us to the castle.</li>
  <li class="number">News, friends; our wars are done, the Turks</li>

  <li>How does my old acquaintance of this isle?</li>
  <li>Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus;</li>
  <li>I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet,</li>
  <li class="number">I prattle out of fashion, and I dote</li>

  <li>Go to the bay and disembark my coffers:</li>
  <li>Bring thou the master to the citadel;</li>
  <li>He is a good one, and his worthiness</li>

<ol data-speaker="RODERIGO">
  <li>With him! why, ’tis not possible.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li class="number">Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.</li>
  <li>Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor,</li>
  <li>but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies:</li>
  <li>and will she love him still for prating? let not</li>
  <li>thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed;</li>
  <li class="number">and what delight shall she have to look on the</li>
  <li>devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of</li>
  <li>sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to</li>
  <li>give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour,</li>
  <li>sympathy in years, manners and beauties; all which</li>
  <li class="number">the Moor is defective in: now, for want of these</li>
  <li>required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will</li>
  <li>find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge,</li>
  <li>disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will</li>
  <li>instruct her in it and compel her to some second</li>
  <li class="number">choice. Now, sir, this granted — as it is a most</li>
  <li>pregnant and unforced position — who stands so</li>
  <li>eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio</li>
  <li>does? a knave very voluble; no further</li>
  <li>conscionable than in putting on the mere form of</li>
  <li class="number">civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing</li>
  <li>of his salt and most hidden loose affection? why,</li>
  <li>none; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave, a</li>
  <li>finder of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and</li>
  <li>counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never</li>
  <li class="number">present itself; a devilish knave. Besides, the</li>
  <li>knave is handsome, young, and hath all those</li>
  <li>requisites in him that folly and green minds look</li>
  <li>after: a pestilent complete knave; and the woman</li>
  <li>hath found him already.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RODERIGO">
  <li class="number">I cannot believe that in her; she’s full of</li>
  <li>most blessed condition.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>Blessed fig’s-end! the wine she drinks is made of</li>
  <li>grapes: if she had been blessed, she would never</li>

  <li class="number">not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? didst</li>
  <li>not mark that?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RODERIGO">

  <li>Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue</li>

  <li>for the command, I’ll lay’t upon you. Cassio knows</li>
  <li>you not. I’ll not be far from you: do you find</li>

  <li>too loud, or tainting his discipline; or from what</li>

  <li>Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haply</li>

  <li>Montano and myself being in speech,</li>

  <li>And Cassio following him with determined sword,</li>
  <li class="number">To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman</li>
  <li>Steps in to Cassio, and entreats his pause:</li>
  <li>Myself the crying fellow did pursue,</li>
  <li>Lest by his clamour — as it so fell out — </li>
  <li>The town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot,</li>
  <li class="number">Outran my purpose; and I return’d the rather</li>
  <li>For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,</li>
  <li>And Cassio high in oath; which till to-night</li>

  <li>For this was brief — I found them close together,</li>
  <li class="number">At blow and thrust; even as again they were</li>
  <li>When you yourself did part them.</li>
  <li>More of this matter cannot I report:</li>
  <li>But men are men; the best sometimes forget:</li>
  <li>Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,</li>
  <li class="number">As men in rage strike those that wish them best,</li>

<ol data-speaker="CASSIO">
  <li>Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost</li>
  <li>my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of</li>
  <li>myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation,</li>
  <li>Iago, my reputation!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li class="number">As I am an honest man, I thought you had received</li>
  <li>some bodily wound; there is more sense in that than</li>
  <li>in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false</li>
  <li>imposition: oft got without merit, and lost without</li>
  <li>deserving: you have lost no reputation at all,</li>
  <li class="number">unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man!</li>
  <li>there are ways to recover the general again: you</li>
  <li>are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in</li>
  <li>policy than in malice, even so as one would beat his</li>
  <li>offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion: sue</li>
  <li class="number">to him again, and he’s yours.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CASSIO">
  <li>I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so</li>
  <li>good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so</li>
  <li>indiscreet an officer. Drunk? and speak parrot?</li>
  <li>and squabble? swagger? swear? and discourse</li>
  <li class="number">fustian with one’s own shadow? O thou invisible</li>
  <li>spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by,</li>
  <li>let us call thee devil!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>What was he that you followed with your sword? What</li>
  <li>had he done to you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CASSIO">
  <li class="number">I know not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>Is’t possible?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CASSIO">
  <li>I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly;</li>
  <li>a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men</li>
  <li>should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away</li>
  <li class="number">their brains! that we should, with joy, pleasance</li>
  <li>revel and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>Why, but you are now well enough: how came you thus</li>
  <li>recovered?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CASSIO">
  <li>It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place</li>
  <li class="number">to the devil wrath; one unperfectness shows me</li>
  <li>another, to make me frankly despise myself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>Come, you are too severe a moraler: as the time,</li>
  <li>the place, and the condition of this country</li>
  <li>stands, I could heartily wish this had not befallen;</li>
  <li class="number">but, since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CASSIO">
  <li>I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me</li>
  <li>I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra,</li>
  <li>such an answer would stop them all. To be now a</li>
  <li>sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a</li>
  <li class="number">beast! O strange! Every inordinate cup is</li>
  <li>unblessed and the ingredient is a devil.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature,</li>
  <li>if it be well used: exclaim no more against it.</li>
  <li>And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CASSIO">
  <li class="number">I have well approved it, sir. I drunk!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>You or any man living may be drunk! at a time, man.</li>
  <li>I’ll tell you what you shall do. Our general’s wife</li>
  <li>is now the general: may say so in this respect, for</li>
  <li>that he hath devoted and given up himself to the</li>
  <li class="number">contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and</li>
  <li>graces: confess yourself freely to her; importune</li>
  <li>her help to put you in your place again: she is of</li>
  <li>so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition,</li>
  <li>she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more</li>
  <li class="number">than she is requested: this broken joint between</li>
  <li>you and her husband entreat her to splinter; and, my</li>
  <li>fortunes against any lay worth naming, this</li>
  <li>crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CASSIO">
  <li>You advise me well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li class="number">I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CASSIO">
  <li>I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will</li>
  <li>beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me:</li>
  <li>I am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant; I</li>
  <li class="number">must to the watch.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CASSIO">
  <li>Good night, honest Iago.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>And what’s he then that says I play the villain?</li>
  <li>When this advice is free I give and honest,</li>
  <li>Probal to thinking and indeed the course</li>
  <li class="number">To win the Moor again? For ’tis most easy</li>
  <li>The inclining Desdemona to subdue</li>
  <li>In any honest suit: she’s framed as fruitful</li>
  <li>As the free elements. And then for her</li>
  <li>To win the Moor — were’t to renounce his baptism,</li>
  <li class="number">All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,</li>
  <li>His soul is so enfetter’d to her love,</li>
  <li>That she may make, unmake, do what she list,</li>
  <li>Even as her appetite shall play the god</li>
  <li>With his weak function. How am I then a villain</li>
  <li class="number">To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,</li>
  <li>Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!</li>
  <li>When devils will the blackest sins put on,</li>
  <li>They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,</li>
  <li>As I do now: for whiles this honest fool</li>
  <li class="number">Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes</li>
  <li>And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,</li>
  <li>I’ll pour this pestilence into his ear,</li>
  <li>That she repeals him for her body’s lust;</li>
  <li>And by how much she strives to do him good,</li>
  <li class="number">She shall undo her credit with the Moor.</li>
  <li>So will I turn her virtue into pitch,</li>
  <li>And out of her own goodness make the net</li>
  <li>That shall enmesh them all.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Re-enter RODERIGO</li>
  <li>How now, Roderigo!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RODERIGO">
  <li class="number">I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that</li>

  <li>cudgelled; and I think the issue will be, I shall</li>
  <li>have so much experience for my pains, and so, with</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">

  <li>What wound did ever heal but by degrees?</li>
  <li>Thou know’st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft;</li>
  <li>And wit depends on dilatory time.</li>
  <li class="number">Does’t not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee.</li>
  <li>And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier’d Cassio:</li>
  <li>Though other things grow fair against the sun,</li>

  <li>In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst ’Indeed!’</li>
  <li>And didst contract and purse thy brow together,</li>
  <li class="number">As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain</li>
  <li>Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,</li>
  <li>Show me thy thought.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>My lord, you know I love you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>I think thou dost;</li>
  <li class="number">And, for I know thou’rt full of love and honesty,</li>
  <li>And weigh’st thy words before thou givest them breath,</li>
  <li>Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:</li>
  <li>For such things in a false disloyal knave</li>
  <li>Are tricks of custom, but in a man that’s just</li>
  <li class="number">They are close delations, working from the heart</li>
  <li>That passion cannot rule.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>For Michael Cassio,</li>
  <li>I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>I think so too.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li class="number">Men should be what they seem;</li>
  <li>Or those that be not, would they might seem none!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>Certain, men should be what they seem.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>Why, then, I think Cassio’s an honest man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>Nay, yet there’s more in this:</li>
  <li class="number">I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,</li>
  <li>As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts</li>
  <li>The worst of words.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>Good my lord, pardon me:</li>
  <li>Though I am bound to every act of duty,</li>
  <li class="number">I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.</li>
  <li>Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false;</li>
  <li>As where’s that palace whereinto foul things</li>
  <li>Sometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure,</li>
  <li>But some uncleanly apprehensions</li>
  <li class="number">Keep leets and law-days and in session sit</li>
  <li>With meditations lawful?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,</li>
  <li>If thou but think’st him wrong’d and makest his ear</li>
  <li>A stranger to thy thoughts.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li class="number">I do beseech you — </li>
  <li>Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,</li>
  <li>As, I confess, it is my nature’s plague</li>
  <li>To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy</li>
  <li>Shapes faults that are not — that your wisdom yet,</li>
  <li class="number">From one that so imperfectly conceits,</li>
  <li>Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble</li>
  <li>Out of his scattering and unsure observance.</li>
  <li>It were not for your quiet nor your good,</li>
  <li>Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,</li>
  <li class="number">To let you know my thoughts.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>What dost thou mean?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,</li>
  <li>Is the immediate jewel of their souls:</li>
  <li>Who steals my purse steals trash; ’tis something, nothing;</li>
  <li class="number">’Twas mine, ’tis his, and has been slave to thousands:</li>
  <li>But he that filches from me my good name</li>
  <li>Robs me of that which not enriches him</li>
  <li>And makes me poor indeed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>By heaven, I’ll know thy thoughts.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li class="number">You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;</li>
  <li>Nor shall not, whilst ’tis in my custody.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>Ha!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;</li>
  <li>It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock</li>
  <li class="number">The meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in bliss</li>
  <li>Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;</li>
  <li>But, O, what damned minutes tells he o’er</li>
  <li>Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>O misery!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li class="number">Poor and content is rich and rich enough,</li>
  <li>But riches fineless is as poor as winter</li>
  <li>To him that ever fears he shall be poor.</li>
  <li>Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend</li>
  <li>From jealousy!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li class="number">Why, why is this?</li>
  <li>Think’st thou I’ld make a lie of jealousy,</li>
  <li>To follow still the changes of the moon</li>
  <li>With fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubt</li>
  <li>Is once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat,</li>
  <li class="number">When I shall turn the business of my soul</li>
  <li>To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,</li>
  <li>Matching thy inference. ’Tis not to make me jealous</li>
  <li>To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,</li>
  <li>Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well;</li>
  <li class="number">Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:</li>
  <li>Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw</li>
  <li>The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;</li>
  <li>For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago;</li>
  <li>I’ll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;</li>
  <li class="number">And on the proof, there is no more but this — </li>
  <li>Away at once with love or jealousy!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>I am glad of it; for now I shall have reason</li>
  <li>To show the love and duty that I bear you</li>
  <li>With franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound,</li>
  <li class="number">Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.</li>
  <li>Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;</li>
  <li>Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure:</li>
  <li>I would not have your free and noble nature,</li>
  <li>Out of self-bounty, be abused; look to’t:</li>
  <li class="number">I know our country disposition well;</li>
  <li>In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks</li>
  <li>They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience</li>
  <li>Is not to leave’t undone, but keep’t unknown.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>Dost thou say so?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li class="number">She did deceive her father, marrying you;</li>
  <li>And when she seem’d to shake and fear your looks,</li>
  <li>She loved them most.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>And so she did.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>Why, go to then;</li>
  <li class="number">She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,</li>
  <li>To seal her father’s eyes up close as oak-</li>
  <li>He thought ’twas witchcraft — but I am much to blame;</li>
  <li>I humbly do beseech you of your pardon</li>
  <li>For too much loving you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li class="number">I am bound to thee for ever.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>I see this hath a little dash’d your spirits.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>Not a jot, not a jot.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>I’ faith, I fear it has.</li>
  <li>I hope you will consider what is spoke</li>
  <li class="number">Comes from my love. But I do see you’re moved:</li>
  <li>I am to pray you not to strain my speech</li>
  <li>To grosser issues nor to larger reach</li>
  <li>Than to suspicion.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>I will not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li class="number">Should you do so, my lord,</li>
  <li>My speech should fall into such vile success</li>
  <li>As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio’s my worthy friend — </li>
  <li>My lord, I see you’re moved.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>No, not much moved:</li>
  <li class="number">I do not think but Desdemona’s honest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>Long live she so! and long live you to think so!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>And yet, how nature erring from itself — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>Ay, there’s the point: as — to be bold with you — </li>
  <li>Not to affect many proposed matches</li>
  <li class="number">Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,</li>
  <li>Whereto we see in all things nature tends — </li>
  <li>Foh! one may smell in such a will most rank,</li>
  <li>Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural.</li>
  <li>But pardon me; I do not in position</li>
  <li class="number">Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear</li>
  <li>Her will, recoiling to her better judgment,</li>
  <li>May fall to match you with her country forms</li>
  <li>And happily repent.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>Farewell, farewell:</li>
  <li class="number">If more thou dost perceive, let me know more;</li>
  <li>Set on thy wife to observe: leave me, Iago:</li>

  <li>For sure, he fills it up with great ability,</li>
  <li class="number">Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,</li>
  <li>You shall by that perceive him and his means:</li>
  <li>Note, if your lady strain his entertainment</li>
  <li>With any strong or vehement importunity;</li>
  <li>Much will be seen in that. In the mean time,</li>
  <li class="number">Let me be thought too busy in my fears — </li>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li class="number">Nay, stay: thou shouldst be honest.</li>

  <li>Death and damnation! O!</li>

  <li>It is impossible you should see this,</li>

  <li>I could not sleep.</li>
  <li>There are a kind of men so loose of soul,</li>
  <li>That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs:</li>
  <li class="number">One of this kind is Cassio:</li>
  <li>In sleep I heard him say ’Sweet Desdemona,</li>
  <li>Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;’</li>
  <li>And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,</li>
  <li>Cry ’O sweet creature!’ and then kiss me hard,</li>
  <li class="number">As if he pluck’d up kisses by the roots</li>
  <li>That grew upon my lips: then laid his leg</li>
  <li>Over my thigh, and sigh’d, and kiss’d; and then</li>
  <li>Cried ’Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!’</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>O monstrous! monstrous!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li class="number">Nay, this was but his dream.</li>

  <li>’Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>And this may help to thicken other proofs</li>
  <li>That do demonstrate thinly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li class="number">I’ll tear her all to pieces.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>Nay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done;</li>
  <li>She may be honest yet. Tell me but this,</li>
  <li>Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief</li>
  <li>Spotted with strawberries in your wife’s hand?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li class="number">I gave her such a one; ’twas my first gift.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>I know not that; but such a handkerchief — </li>
  <li>I am sure it was your wife’s — did I to-day</li>
  <li>See Cassio wipe his beard with.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>If it be that — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li class="number">If it be that, or any that was hers,</li>
  <li>It speaks against her with the other proofs.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!</li>
  <li>One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.</li>
  <li>Now do I see ’tis true. Look here, Iago;</li>
  <li class="number">All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.</li>
  <li>’Tis gone.</li>
  <li>Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell!</li>
  <li>Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne</li>
  <li>To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,</li>
  <li class="number">For ’tis of aspics’ tongues!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>Yet be content.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>O, blood, blood, blood!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>Never, Iago: Like to the Pontic sea,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose icy current and compulsive course</li>
  <li>Ne’er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on</li>
  <li>To the Propontic and the Hellespont,</li>
  <li>Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,</li>
  <li>Shall ne’er look back, ne’er ebb to humble love,</li>
  <li class="number">Till that a capable and wide revenge</li>
  <li>Swallow them up. Now, by yond marble heaven,</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Kneels</li>
  <li>In the due reverence of a sacred vow</li>
  <li>I here engage my words.</li>

  <li>You elements that clip us round about,</li>
  <li>Witness that here Iago doth give up</li>
  <li>The execution of his wit, hands, heart,</li>
  <li>To wrong’d Othello’s service! Let him command,</li>
  <li class="number">And to obey shall be in me remorse,</li>
  <li>What bloody business ever.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">They rise</div>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>I greet thy love,</li>
  <li>Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,</li>
  <li>And will upon the instant put thee to’t:</li>
  <li class="number">Within these three days let me hear thee say</li>
  <li>That Cassio’s not alive.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>My friend is dead; ’tis done at your request:</li>

  <li>Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!</li>
  <li class="number">Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw,</li>

<h3>SCENE IV.  Before the castle.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, and Clown</div>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li>Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Clown">
  <li>I dare not say he lies any where.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li>Why, man?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Clown">
  <li>He’s a soldier, and for one to say a soldier lies,</li>
  <li class="number">is stabbing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li>Go to: where lodges he?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Clown">
  <li>To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li>Can any thing be made of this?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Clown">
  <li>I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a</li>
  <li class="number">lodging and say he lies here or he lies there, were</li>
  <li>to lie in mine own throat.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li>Can you inquire him out, and be edified by report?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Clown">
  <li>I will catechise the world for him; that is, make</li>
  <li>questions, and by them answer.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li class="number">Seek him, bid him come hither: tell him I have</li>
  <li>moved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Clown">
  <li>To do this is within the compass of man’s wit: and</li>
  <li>therefore I will attempt the doing it.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li>Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EMILIA">
  <li class="number">I know not, madam.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li>Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse</li>
  <li>Full of crusadoes: and, but my noble Moor</li>
  <li>Is true of mind and made of no such baseness</li>
  <li>As jealous creatures are, it were enough</li>
  <li class="number">To put him to ill thinking.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EMILIA">
  <li>Is he not jealous?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li>Who, he? I think the sun where he was born</li>
  <li>Drew all such humours from him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EMILIA">
  <li>Look, where he comes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li class="number">I will not leave him now till Cassio</li>
  <li>Be call’d to him.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter OTHELLO</li>
  <li>How is’t with you, my lord</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>Well, my good lady.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Aside</li>
  <li>O, hardness to dissemble! — </li>
  <li class="number">How do you, Desdemona?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li>Well, my good lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>Give me your hand: this hand is moist, my lady.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li>It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart:</li>
  <li class="number">Hot, hot, and moist: this hand of yours requires</li>
  <li>A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,</li>
  <li>Much castigation, exercise devout;</li>
  <li>For here’s a young and sweating devil here,</li>
  <li>That commonly rebels. ’Tis a good hand,</li>
  <li class="number">A frank one.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li>You may, indeed, say so;</li>
  <li>For ’twas that hand that gave away my heart.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>A liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands;</li>
  <li>But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li class="number">I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>What promise, chuck?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li>I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;</li>
  <li>Lend me thy handkerchief.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li class="number">Here, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>That which I gave you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li>I have it not about me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>Not?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li>No, indeed, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li class="number">That is a fault.</li>
  <li>That handkerchief</li>
  <li>Did an Egyptian to my mother give;</li>
  <li>She was a charmer, and could almost read</li>
  <li>The thoughts of people: she told her, while</li>
  <li class="number">she kept it,</li>
  <li>’Twould make her amiable and subdue my father</li>
  <li>Entirely to her love, but if she lost it</li>
  <li>Or made gift of it, my father’s eye</li>
  <li>Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt</li>
  <li class="number">After new fancies: she, dying, gave it me;</li>
  <li>And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,</li>
  <li>To give it her. I did so: and take heed on’t;</li>
  <li>Make it a darling like your precious eye;</li>
  <li>To lose’t or give’t away were such perdition</li>
  <li class="number">As nothing else could match.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li>Is’t possible?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>’Tis true: there’s magic in the web of it:</li>
  <li>A sibyl, that had number’d in the world</li>
  <li>The sun to course two hundred compasses,</li>
  <li class="number">In her prophetic fury sew’d the work;</li>
  <li>The worms were hallow’d that did breed the silk;</li>
  <li>And it was dyed in mummy which the skilful</li>
  <li>Conserved of maidens’ hearts.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li>Indeed! is’t true?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li class="number">Most veritable; therefore look to’t well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li>Then would to God that I had never seen’t!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>Ha! wherefore?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li>Why do you speak so startingly and rash?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>Is’t lost? is’t gone? speak, is it out</li>
  <li class="number">o’ the way?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li>Heaven bless us!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>Say you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li>It is not lost; but what an if it were?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>How!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li class="number">I say, it is not lost.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>Fetch’t, let me see’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li>Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.</li>
  <li>This is a trick to put me from my suit:</li>
  <li>Pray you, let Cassio be received again.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li class="number">Fetch me the handkerchief: my mind misgives.</li>

  <li>The handkerchief!</li>

  <li>Is not this man jealous?</li>

  <li>I ne’er saw this before.</li>
  <li>Sure, there’s some wonder in this handkerchief:</li>
  <li class="number">I am most unhappy in the loss of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EMILIA">
  <li>’Tis not a year or two shows us a man:</li>
  <li>They are all but stomachs, and we all but food;</li>
  <li>To eat us hungerly, and when they are full,</li>
  <li>They belch us. Look you, Cassio and my husband!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter CASSIO and IAGO</div>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li class="number">There is no other way; ’tis she must do’t:</li>
  <li>And, lo, the happiness! go, and importune her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li>How now, good Cassio! what’s the news with you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CASSIO">
  <li>Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you</li>
  <li>That by your virtuous means I may again</li>
  <li class="number">Exist, and be a member of his love</li>
  <li>Whom I with all the office of my heart</li>
  <li>Entirely honour: I would not be delay’d.</li>
  <li>If my offence be of such mortal kind</li>
  <li>That nor my service past, nor present sorrows,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor purposed merit in futurity,</li>
  <li>Can ransom me into his love again,</li>
  <li>But to know so must be my benefit;</li>
  <li>So shall I clothe me in a forced content,</li>
  <li>And shut myself up in some other course,</li>
  <li class="number">To fortune’s alms.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li>Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!</li>
  <li>My advocation is not now in tune;</li>
  <li>My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him,</li>
  <li>Were he in favour as in humour alter’d.</li>
  <li class="number">So help me every spirit sanctified,</li>
  <li>As I have spoken for you all my best</li>
  <li>And stood within the blank of his displeasure</li>
  <li>For my free speech! you must awhile be patient:</li>
  <li>What I can do I will; and more I will</li>
  <li class="number">Than for myself I dare: let that suffice you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>Is my lord angry?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EMILIA">
  <li>He went hence but now,</li>
  <li>And certainly in strange unquietness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon,</li>
  <li class="number">When it hath blown his ranks into the air,</li>
  <li>And, like the devil, from his very arm</li>
  <li>Puff’d his own brother: — and can he be angry?</li>
  <li>Something of moment then: I will go meet him:</li>
  <li>There’s matter in’t indeed, if he be angry.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li class="number">I prithee, do so.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exit IAGO</li>
  <li>Something, sure, of state,</li>
  <li>Either from Venice, or some unhatch’d practise</li>
  <li>Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,</li>
  <li>Hath puddled his clear spirit: and in such cases</li>
  <li class="number">Men’s natures wrangle with inferior things,</li>
  <li>Though great ones are their object. ’Tis even so;</li>
  <li>For let our finger ache, and it indues</li>
  <li>Our other healthful members even to that sense</li>
  <li>Of pain: nay, we must think men are not gods,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor of them look for such observances</li>
  <li>As fit the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,</li>
  <li>I was, unhandsome warrior as I am,</li>
  <li>Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;</li>
  <li>But now I find I had suborn’d the witness,</li>
  <li class="number">And he’s indicted falsely.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EMILIA">
  <li>Pray heaven it be state-matters, as you think,</li>
  <li>And no conception nor no jealous toy</li>
  <li>Concerning you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li>Alas the day! I never gave him cause.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EMILIA">
  <li class="number">But jealous souls will not be answer’d so;</li>
  <li>They are not ever jealous for the cause,</li>
  <li>But jealous for they are jealous: ’tis a monster</li>
  <li>Begot upon itself, born on itself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li>Heaven keep that monster from Othello’s mind!</li>

  <li class="number">What, keep a week away? seven days and nights?</li>
  <li>Eight score eight hours? and lovers’ absent hours,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CASSIO">
  <li>Pardon me, Bianca:</li>

<ol data-speaker="BIANCA">
  <li>O Cassio, whence came this?</li>

<ol data-speaker="CASSIO">
  <li>Go to, woman!</li>
  <li>Throw your vile guesses in the devil’s teeth,</li>
  <li class="number">From whence you have them. You are jealous now</li>
  <li>That this is from some mistress, some remembrance:</li>
  <li>No, in good troth, Bianca.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIANCA">
  <li>Why, whose is it?</li>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>What,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li class="number">An unauthorized kiss.</li>

  <li>Lie — </li>

  <li>With her?</li>

  <li>With her, on her; what you will.</li>

  <li>Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her, when</li>

  <li> — Handkerchief — confessions — handkerchief! — To</li>
  <li>confess, and be hanged for his labour; — first, to be</li>
  <li>hanged, and then to confess. — I tremble at it.</li>
  <li>Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing</li>
  <li class="number">passion without some instruction. It is not words</li>

  <li>No, forbear;</li>

  <li>Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when</li>
  <li class="number">He hath, and is again to cope your wife:</li>
  <li>I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience;</li>
  <li>Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>Dost thou hear, Iago?</li>
  <li class="number">I will be found most cunning in my patience;</li>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>That’s not amiss;</li>
  <li>But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">OTHELLO retires</li>
  <li>Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,</li>

  <li>He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain</li>
  <li class="number">From the excess of laughter. Here he comes:</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Re-enter CASSIO</li>
  <li>As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad;</li>
  <li>And his unbookish jealousy must construe</li>
  <li>Poor Cassio’s smiles, gestures and light behavior,</li>
  <li>Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CASSIO">
  <li class="number">The worser that you give me the addition</li>

  <li class="stage-direction">Speaking lower</li>
  <li>Now, if this suit lay in Bianco’s power,</li>

<ol data-speaker="CASSIO">
  <li class="number">Alas, poor caitiff!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>Look, how he laughs already!</li>

<ol data-speaker="CASSIO">
  <li>Alas, poor rogue! I think, i’ faith, she loves me.</li>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>Now he denies it faintly, and laughs it out.</li>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li class="number">Do you hear, Cassio?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>Now he importunes him</li>
  <li>To tell it o’er: go to; well said, well said.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>She gives it out that you shall marry hey:</li>
  <li>Do you intend it?</li>

<ol data-speaker="CASSIO">
  <li class="number">Ha, ha, ha!</li>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>Do you triumph, Roman? do you triumph?</li>

<ol data-speaker="CASSIO">
  <li>I marry her! what? a customer! Prithee, bear some</li>

  <li>Ha, ha, ha!</li>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li class="number">So, so, so, so: they laugh that win.</li>

  <li>I am a very villain else.</li>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>Have you scored me? Well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CASSIO">
  <li class="number">This is the monkey’s own giving out: she is</li>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.</li>

  <li>She was here even now; she haunts me in every place.</li>
  <li class="number">I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with</li>

<ol data-speaker="OTHELLO">
  <li>Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O,</li>
  <li>I see that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CASSIO">
  <li class="number">Well, I must leave her company.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">

<ol data-speaker="CASSIO">

  <li>This is some minx’s token, and I must take out the</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li class="number">You charge me most unjustly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RODERIGO">
  <li>With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of</li>
  <li>my means. The jewels you have had from me to</li>

  <li>votarist: you have told me she hath received them</li>
  <li class="number">and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>Well; go to; very well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RODERIGO">
  <li>Very well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor ’tis</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>Very well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RODERIGO">
  <li>I tell you ’tis not very well. I will make myself</li>

  <li class="number">unlawful solicitation; if not, assure yourself I</li>
  <li>will seek satisfaction of you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>You have said now.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RODERIGO">
  <li>Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>Why, now I see there’s mettle in thee, and even from</li>
  <li class="number">this instant to build on thee a better opinion than</li>
  <li>ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo: thou hast</li>
  <li>taken against me a most just exception; but yet, I</li>
  <li>protest, I have dealt most directly in thy affair.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RODERIGO">
  <li>It hath not appeared.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li class="number">I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your</li>
  <li>suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But,</li>
  <li>Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I</li>
  <li>have greater reason to believe now than ever, I mean</li>
  <li>purpose, courage and valour, this night show it: if</li>
  <li class="number">thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona,</li>
  <li>take me from this world with treachery and devise</li>
  <li>engines for my life.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RODERIGO">
  <li>Well, what is it? is it within reason and compass?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice</li>
  <li class="number">to depute Cassio in Othello’s place.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RODERIGO">
  <li>Is that true? why, then Othello and Desdemona</li>
  <li>return again to Venice.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>O, no; he goes into Mauritania and takes away with</li>
  <li>him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be</li>
  <li class="number">lingered here by some accident: wherein none can be</li>
  <li>so determinate as the removing of Cassio.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RODERIGO">
  <li>How do you mean, removing of him?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>Why, by making him uncapable of Othello’s place;</li>
  <li>knocking out his brains.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RODERIGO">
  <li class="number">And that you would have me to do?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right.</li>
  <li>He sups to-night with a harlotry, and thither will I</li>
  <li>go to him: he knows not yet of his horrorable</li>
  <li>fortune. If you will watch his going thence, which</li>
  <li class="number">I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one,</li>
  <li>you may take him at your pleasure: I will be near</li>
  <li>to second your attempt, and he shall fall between</li>
  <li>us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with</li>
  <li>me; I will show you such a necessity in his death</li>
  <li class="number">that you shall think yourself bound to put it on</li>
  <li>him. It is now high suppertime, and the night grows</li>
  <li>to waste: about it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RODERIGO">
  <li>I will hear further reason for this.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO">
  <li>And you shall be satisfied.</li>

  <li class="number">Why, would not you?</li>

<ol data-speaker="DESDEMONA">
  <li>No, by this heavenly light!</li>

  <li>In troth, I think thou wouldst not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EMILIA">
  <li>In troth, I think I should; and undo’t when I had</li>

  <li>gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty</li>
  <li>exhibition; but for the whole world — why, who would</li>

<ol data-speaker="EMILIA">
  <li>Why the wrong is but a wrong i’ the world: and</li>
  <li>having the world for your labour, tis a wrong in your</li>

  <li>Yes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage as would</li>

  <li>But I do think it is their husbands’ faults</li>
  <li>If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,</li>
  <li class="number">And pour our treasures into foreign laps,</li>
  <li>Or else break out in peevish jealousies,</li>
  <li>Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us,</li>
  <li>Or scant our former having in despite;</li>
  <li>Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,</li>
  <li class="number">Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know</li>
  <li>Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell</li>
  <li>And have their palates both for sweet and sour,</li>
  <li>As husbands have. What is it that they do</li>
  <li>When they change us for others? Is it sport?</li>
  <li class="number">I think it is: and doth affection breed it?</li>
  <li>I think it doth: is’t frailty that thus errs?</li>
  <li>It is so too: and have not we affections,</li>
  <li>Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?</li>
  <li>Then let them use us well: else let them know,</li>
  <li class="number">The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.</li>
