<section class="scene">

<h3>SCENE I.  Athens. The palace of THESEUS.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, and
Attendants</div>

<ol data-speaker="THESEUS">
  <li>Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour</li>
  <li>Draws on apace; four happy days bring in</li>
  <li>Another moon: but, O, methinks, how slow</li>
  <li>This old moon wanes! she lingers my desires,</li>
  <li class="number">Like to a step-dame or a dowager</li>
  <li>Long withering out a young man revenue.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HIPPOLYTA">
  <li>Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;</li>
  <li>Four nights will quickly dream away the time;</li>
  <li>And then the moon, like to a silver bow</li>
  <li class="number">New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night</li>
  <li>Of our solemnities.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THESEUS">
  <li>Go, Philostrate,</li>
  <li>Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;</li>
  <li>Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;</li>
  <li class="number">Turn melancholy forth to funerals;</li>
  <li>The pale companion is not for our pomp.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exit PHILOSTRATE</li>
  <li>Hippolyta, I woo’d thee with my sword,</li>
  <li>And won thy love, doing thee injuries;</li>
  <li>But I will wed thee in another key,</li>
  <li class="number">With pomp, with triumph and with revelling.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter EGEUS, HERMIA, LYSANDER, and DEMETRIUS</div>

<ol data-speaker="EGEUS">
  <li>Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THESEUS">
  <li>Thanks, good Egeus: what’s the news with thee?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EGEUS">
  <li>Full of vexation come I, with complaint</li>
  <li>Against my child, my daughter Hermia.</li>
  <li class="number">Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,</li>
  <li>This man hath my consent to marry her.</li>
  <li>Stand forth, Lysander: and my gracious duke,</li>
  <li>This man hath bewitch’d the bosom of my child;</li>
  <li>Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,</li>
  <li class="number">And interchanged love-tokens with my child:</li>
  <li>Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,</li>
  <li>With feigning voice verses of feigning love,</li>
  <li>And stolen the impression of her fantasy</li>
  <li>With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,</li>
  <li class="number">Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers</li>
  <li>Of strong prevailment in unharden’d youth:</li>
  <li>With cunning hast thou filch’d my daughter’s heart,</li>
  <li>Turn’d her obedience, which is due to me,</li>
  <li>To stubborn harshness: and, my gracious duke,</li>
  <li class="number">Be it so she; will not here before your grace</li>
  <li>Consent to marry with Demetrius,</li>
  <li>I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,</li>
  <li>As she is mine, I may dispose of her:</li>
  <li>Which shall be either to this gentleman</li>
  <li class="number">Or to her death, according to our law</li>
  <li>Immediately provided in that case.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THESEUS">
  <li>What say you, Hermia? be advised fair maid:</li>
  <li>To you your father should be as a god;</li>
  <li>One that composed your beauties, yea, and one</li>
  <li class="number">To whom you are but as a form in wax</li>
  <li>By him imprinted and within his power</li>
  <li>To leave the figure or disfigure it.</li>
  <li>Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERMIA">
  <li>So is Lysander.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THESEUS">
  <li class="number">In himself he is;</li>
  <li>But in this kind, wanting your father’s voice,</li>
  <li>The other must be held the worthier.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERMIA">
  <li>I would my father look’d but with my eyes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THESEUS">
  <li>Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERMIA">
  <li class="number">I do entreat your grace to pardon me.</li>
  <li>I know not by what power I am made bold,</li>
  <li>Nor how it may concern my modesty,</li>
  <li>In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;</li>
  <li>But I beseech your grace that I may know</li>
  <li class="number">The worst that may befall me in this case,</li>
  <li>If I refuse to wed Demetrius.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THESEUS">
  <li>Either to die the death or to abjure</li>
  <li>For ever the society of men.</li>
  <li>Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires;</li>
  <li class="number">Know of your youth, examine well your blood,</li>
  <li>Whether, if you yield not to your father’s choice,</li>
  <li>You can endure the livery of a nun,</li>
  <li>For aye to be in shady cloister mew’d,</li>
  <li>To live a barren sister all your life,</li>
  <li class="number">Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.</li>
  <li>Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood,</li>
  <li>To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;</li>
  <li>But earthlier happy is the rose distill’d,</li>
  <li>Than that which withering on the virgin thorn</li>
  <li class="number">Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERMIA">
  <li>So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,</li>
  <li>Ere I will my virgin patent up</li>
  <li>Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke</li>
  <li>My soul consents not to give sovereignty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THESEUS">
  <li class="number">Take time to pause; and, by the nest new moon — </li>
  <li>The sealing-day betwixt my love and me,</li>
  <li>For everlasting bond of fellowship — </li>
  <li>Upon that day either prepare to die</li>
  <li>For disobedience to your father’s will,</li>
  <li class="number">Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would;</li>
  <li>Or on Diana’s altar to protest</li>
  <li>For aye austerity and single life.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DEMETRIUS">
  <li>Relent, sweet Hermia: and, Lysander, yield</li>
  <li>Thy crazed title to my certain right.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LYSANDER">
  <li class="number">You have her father’s love, Demetrius;</li>
  <li>Let me have Hermia’s: do you marry him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EGEUS">
  <li>Scornful Lysander! true, he hath my love,</li>
  <li>And what is mine my love shall render him.</li>
  <li>And she is mine, and all my right of her</li>
  <li class="number">I do estate unto Demetrius.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LYSANDER">
  <li>I am, my lord, as well derived as he,</li>
  <li>As well possess’d; my love is more than his;</li>
  <li>My fortunes every way as fairly rank’d,</li>
  <li>If not with vantage, as Demetrius’;</li>
  <li class="number">And, which is more than all these boasts can be,</li>
  <li>I am beloved of beauteous Hermia:</li>
  <li>Why should not I then prosecute my right?</li>
  <li>Demetrius, I’ll avouch it to his head,</li>
  <li>Made love to Nedar’s daughter, Helena,</li>
  <li class="number">And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,</li>
  <li>Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,</li>
  <li>Upon this spotted and inconstant man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THESEUS">
  <li>I must confess that I have heard so much,</li>
  <li>And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;</li>
  <li class="number">But, being over-full of self-affairs,</li>
  <li>My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come;</li>
  <li>And come, Egeus; you shall go with me,</li>
  <li>I have some private schooling for you both.</li>
  <li>For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself</li>
  <li class="number">To fit your fancies to your father’s will;</li>
  <li>Or else the law of Athens yields you up — </li>
  <li>Which by no means we may extenuate — </li>
  <li>To death, or to a vow of single life.</li>
  <li>Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?</li>
  <li class="number">Demetrius and Egeus, go along:</li>
  <li>I must employ you in some business</li>
  <li>Against our nuptial and confer with you</li>
  <li>Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EGEUS">
  <li>With duty and desire we follow you.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt all but LYSANDER and HERMIA</div>

<ol data-speaker="LYSANDER">
  <li class="number">How now, my love! why is your cheek so pale?</li>
  <li>How chance the roses there do fade so fast?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERMIA">
  <li>Belike for want of rain, which I could well</li>
  <li>Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LYSANDER">
  <li>Ay me! for aught that I could ever read,</li>
  <li class="number">Could ever hear by tale or history,</li>
  <li>The course of true love never did run smooth;</li>
  <li>But, either it was different in blood — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERMIA">
  <li>O cross! too high to be enthrall’d to low.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LYSANDER">
  <li>Or else misgraffed in respect of years — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERMIA">
  <li class="number">O spite! too old to be engaged to young.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LYSANDER">
  <li>Or else it stood upon the choice of friends — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERMIA">
  <li>O hell! to choose love by another’s eyes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LYSANDER">
  <li>Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,</li>
  <li>War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,</li>
  <li class="number">Making it momentany as a sound,</li>
  <li>Swift as a shadow, short as any dream;</li>
  <li>Brief as the lightning in the collied night,</li>
  <li>That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,</li>
  <li>And ere a man hath power to say ’Behold!’</li>
  <li class="number">The jaws of darkness do devour it up:</li>
  <li>So quick bright things come to confusion.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERMIA">
  <li>If then true lovers have been ever cross’d,</li>
  <li>It stands as an edict in destiny:</li>
  <li>Then let us teach our trial patience,</li>
  <li class="number">Because it is a customary cross,</li>
  <li>As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,</li>
  <li>Wishes and tears, poor fancy’s followers.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LYSANDER">
  <li>A good persuasion: therefore, hear me, Hermia.</li>
  <li>I have a widow aunt, a dowager</li>
  <li class="number">Of great revenue, and she hath no child:</li>
  <li>From Athens is her house remote seven leagues;</li>
  <li>And she respects me as her only son.</li>
  <li>There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;</li>
  <li>And to that place the sharp Athenian law</li>
  <li class="number">Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,</li>
  <li>Steal forth thy father’s house to-morrow night;</li>
  <li>And in the wood, a league without the town,</li>
  <li>Where I did meet thee once with Helena,</li>
  <li>To do observance to a morn of May,</li>
  <li class="number">There will I stay for thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERMIA">
  <li>My good Lysander!</li>
  <li>I swear to thee, by Cupid’s strongest bow,</li>
  <li>By his best arrow with the golden head,</li>
  <li>By the simplicity of Venus’ doves,</li>
  <li class="number">By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,</li>
  <li>And by that fire which burn’d the Carthage queen,</li>
  <li>When the false Troyan under sail was seen,</li>
  <li>By all the vows that ever men have broke,</li>
  <li>In number more than ever women spoke,</li>
  <li class="number">In that same place thou hast appointed me,</li>
  <li>To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LYSANDER">
  <li>Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter HELENA</div>

<ol data-speaker="HERMIA">
  <li>God speed fair Helena! whither away?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>Call you me fair? that fair again unsay.</li>
  <li class="number">Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair!</li>
  <li>Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue’s sweet air</li>
  <li>More tuneable than lark to shepherd’s ear,</li>
  <li>When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.</li>
  <li>Sickness is catching: O, were favour so,</li>
  <li class="number">Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;</li>
  <li>My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,</li>
  <li>My tongue should catch your tongue’s sweet melody.</li>
  <li>Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,</li>
  <li>The rest I’d give to be to you translated.</li>
  <li class="number">O, teach me how you look, and with what art</li>
  <li>You sway the motion of Demetrius’ heart.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERMIA">
  <li>I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERMIA">
  <li>I give him curses, yet he gives me love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li class="number">O that my prayers could such affection move!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERMIA">
  <li>The more I hate, the more he follows me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>The more I love, the more he hateth me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERMIA">
  <li>His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>None, but your beauty: would that fault were mine!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERMIA">
  <li class="number">Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;</li>
  <li>Lysander and myself will fly this place.</li>
  <li>Before the time I did Lysander see,</li>
  <li>Seem’d Athens as a paradise to me:</li>
  <li>O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,</li>
  <li class="number">That he hath turn’d a heaven unto a hell!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LYSANDER">
  <li>Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:</li>
  <li>To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold</li>
  <li>Her silver visage in the watery glass,</li>
  <li>Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,</li>
  <li class="number">A time that lovers’ flights doth still conceal,</li>
  <li>Through Athens’ gates have we devised to steal.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERMIA">
  <li>And in the wood, where often you and I</li>
  <li>Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie,</li>
  <li>Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,</li>
  <li class="number">There my Lysander and myself shall meet;</li>
  <li>And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,</li>
  <li>To seek new friends and stranger companies.</li>
  <li>Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us;</li>
  <li>And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!</li>
  <li class="number">Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight</li>
  <li>From lovers’ food till morrow deep midnight.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LYSANDER">
  <li>I will, my Hermia.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exit HERMIA</li>
  <li>Helena, adieu:</li>
  <li>As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li class="number">How happy some o’er other some can be!</li>
  <li>Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.</li>
  <li>But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;</li>
  <li>He will not know what all but he do know:</li>
  <li>And as he errs, doting on Hermia’s eyes,</li>
  <li class="number">So I, admiring of his qualities:</li>
  <li>Things base and vile, folding no quantity,</li>
  <li>Love can transpose to form and dignity:</li>
  <li>Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;</li>
  <li>And therefore is wing’d Cupid painted blind:</li>
  <li class="number">Nor hath Love’s mind of any judgement taste;</li>
  <li>Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:</li>
  <li>And therefore is Love said to be a child,</li>
  <li>Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.</li>
  <li>As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,</li>
  <li class="number">So the boy Love is perjured every where:</li>
  <li>For ere Demetrius look’d on Hermia’s eyne,</li>
  <li>He hail’d down oaths that he was only mine;</li>
  <li>And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,</li>
  <li>So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.</li>
  <li class="number">I will go tell him of fair Hermia’s flight:</li>
  <li>Then to the wood will he to-morrow night</li>
  <li>Pursue her; and for this intelligence</li>
  <li>If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:</li>
  <li>But herein mean I to enrich my pain,</li>
  <li class="number">To have his sight thither and back again.</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  Athens. QUINCE’S house.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and
STARVELING</div>

<ol data-speaker="QUINCE">
  <li>Is all our company here?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOTTOM">
  <li>You were best to call them generally, man by man,</li>
  <li>according to the scrip.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUINCE">
  <li>Here is the scroll of every man’s name, which is</li>
  <li class="number">thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our</li>
  <li>interlude before the duke and the duchess, on his</li>
  <li>wedding-day at night.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOTTOM">
  <li>First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats</li>
  <li>on, then read the names of the actors, and so grow</li>
  <li class="number">to a point.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUINCE">
  <li>Marry, our play is, The most lamentable comedy, and</li>
  <li>most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOTTOM">
  <li>A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a</li>
  <li>merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your</li>
  <li class="number">actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUINCE">
  <li>Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOTTOM">
  <li>Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUINCE">
  <li>You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOTTOM">
  <li>What is Pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUINCE">
  <li class="number">A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOTTOM">
  <li>That will ask some tears in the true performing of</li>
  <li>it: if I do it, let the audience look to their</li>
  <li>eyes; I will move storms, I will condole in some</li>
  <li>measure. To the rest: yet my chief humour is for a</li>
  <li class="number">tyrant: I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to</li>
  <li>tear a cat in, to make all split.</li>
  <li>The raging rocks</li>
  <li>And shivering shocks</li>
  <li>Shall break the locks</li>
  <li class="number">Of prison gates;</li>
  <li>And Phibbus’ car</li>
  <li>Shall shine from far</li>
  <li>And make and mar</li>
  <li>The foolish Fates.</li>
  <li class="number">This was lofty! Now name the rest of the players.</li>
  <li>This is Ercles’ vein, a tyrant’s vein; a lover is</li>
  <li>more condoling.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUINCE">
  <li>Francis Flute, the bellows-mender.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLUTE">
  <li>Here, Peter Quince.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUINCE">
  <li class="number">Flute, you must take Thisby on you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLUTE">
  <li>What is Thisby? a wandering knight?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUINCE">
  <li>It is the lady that Pyramus must love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLUTE">
  <li>Nay, faith, let me not play a woman; I have a beard coming.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUINCE">
  <li>That’s all one: you shall play it in a mask, and</li>
  <li class="number">you may speak as small as you will.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOTTOM">
  <li>An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too, I’ll</li>
  <li>speak in a monstrous little voice. ’Thisne,</li>
  <li>Thisne;’ ’Ah, Pyramus, lover dear! thy Thisby dear,</li>
  <li>and lady dear!’</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUINCE">
  <li class="number">No, no; you must play Pyramus: and, Flute, you Thisby.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOTTOM">
  <li>Well, proceed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUINCE">
  <li>Robin Starveling, the tailor.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="STARVELING">
  <li>Here, Peter Quince.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUINCE">
  <li>Robin Starveling, you must play Thisby’s mother.</li>
  <li class="number">Tom Snout, the tinker.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SNOUT">
  <li>Here, Peter Quince.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUINCE">
  <li>You, Pyramus’ father: myself, Thisby’s father:</li>
  <li>Snug, the joiner; you, the lion’s part: and, I</li>
  <li>hope, here is a play fitted.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SNUG">
  <li class="number">Have you the lion’s part written? pray you, if it</li>
  <li>be, give it me, for I am slow of study.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUINCE">
  <li>You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOTTOM">
  <li>Let me play the lion too: I will roar, that I will</li>
  <li>do any man’s heart good to hear me; I will roar,</li>
  <li class="number">that I will make the duke say ’Let him roar again,</li>
  <li>let him roar again.’</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUINCE">
  <li>An you should do it too terribly, you would fright</li>
  <li>the duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek;</li>
  <li>and that were enough to hang us all.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALL">
  <li class="number">That would hang us, every mother’s son.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOTTOM">
  <li>I grant you, friends, if that you should fright the</li>
  <li>ladies out of their wits, they would have no more</li>
  <li>discretion but to hang us: but I will aggravate my</li>
  <li>voice so that I will roar you as gently as any</li>
  <li class="number">sucking dove; I will roar you an ’twere any</li>
  <li>nightingale.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUINCE">
  <li>You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a</li>
  <li>sweet-faced man; a proper man, as one shall see in a</li>
  <li>summer’s day; a most lovely gentleman-like man:</li>
  <li class="number">therefore you must needs play Pyramus.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOTTOM">
  <li>Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I best</li>
  <li>to play it in?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUINCE">
  <li>Why, what you will.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOTTOM">
  <li>I will discharge it in either your straw-colour</li>
  <li class="number">beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain</li>
  <li>beard, or your French-crown-colour beard, your</li>
  <li>perfect yellow.</li>
</ol>

<h2>ACT II</h2>

<section class="scene">

<h3>SCENE I.  A wood near Athens.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter, from opposite sides, a Fairy, and PUCK</div>

<ol data-speaker="PUCK">
  <li>How now, spirit! whither wander you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Fairy">
  <li>Over hill, over dale,</li>
  <li>Thorough bush, thorough brier,</li>
  <li>Over park, over pale,</li>
  <li class="number">Thorough flood, thorough fire,</li>
  <li>I do wander everywhere,</li>
  <li>Swifter than the moon’s sphere;</li>
  <li>And I serve the fairy queen,</li>
  <li>To dew her orbs upon the green.</li>
  <li class="number">The cowslips tall her pensioners be:</li>
  <li>In their gold coats spots you see;</li>
  <li>Those be rubies, fairy favours,</li>
  <li>In those freckles live their savours:</li>
  <li>I must go seek some dewdrops here</li>
  <li class="number">And hang a pearl in every cowslip’s ear.</li>
  <li>Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I’ll be gone:</li>
  <li>Our queen and all our elves come here anon.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PUCK">
  <li>The king doth keep his revels here to-night:</li>
  <li>Take heed the queen come not within his sight;</li>
  <li class="number">For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,</li>
  <li>Because that she as her attendant hath</li>
  <li>A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;</li>
  <li>She never had so sweet a changeling;</li>
  <li>And jealous Oberon would have the child</li>
  <li class="number">Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;</li>
  <li>But she perforce withholds the loved boy,</li>
  <li>Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:</li>
  <li>And now they never meet in grove or green,</li>
  <li>By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,</li>
  <li class="number">But, they do square, that all their elves for fear</li>
  <li>Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Fairy">
  <li>Either I mistake your shape and making quite,</li>
  <li>Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite</li>
  <li>Call’d Robin Goodfellow: are not you he</li>
  <li class="number">That frights the maidens of the villagery;</li>
  <li>Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern</li>
  <li>And bootless make the breathless housewife churn;</li>
  <li>And sometime make the drink to bear no barm;</li>
  <li>Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?</li>
  <li class="number">Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck,</li>
  <li>You do their work, and they shall have good luck:</li>
  <li>Are not you he?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PUCK">
  <li>Thou speak’st aright;</li>
  <li>I am that merry wanderer of the night.</li>
  <li class="number">I jest to Oberon and make him smile</li>
  <li>When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,</li>
  <li>Neighing in likeness of a filly foal:</li>
  <li>And sometime lurk I in a gossip’s bowl,</li>
  <li>In very likeness of a roasted crab,</li>
  <li class="number">And when she drinks, against her lips I bob</li>
  <li>And on her wither’d dewlap pour the ale.</li>
  <li>The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,</li>
  <li>Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;</li>
  <li>Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,</li>
  <li class="number">And ’tailor’ cries, and falls into a cough;</li>
  <li>And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh,</li>
  <li>And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear</li>
  <li>A merrier hour was never wasted there.</li>
  <li>But, room, fairy! here comes Oberon.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Fairy">
  <li class="number">And here my mistress. Would that he were gone!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter, from one side, OBERON, with his train;
from the other, TITANIA, with hers</div>

<ol data-speaker="OBERON">
  <li>Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITANIA">
  <li>What, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence:</li>
  <li>I have forsworn his bed and company.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OBERON">
  <li>Tarry, rash wanton: am not I thy lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITANIA">
  <li class="number">Then I must be thy lady: but I know</li>
  <li>When thou hast stolen away from fairy land,</li>
  <li>And in the shape of Corin sat all day,</li>
  <li>Playing on pipes of corn and versing love</li>
  <li>To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,</li>
  <li class="number">Come from the farthest Steppe of India?</li>
  <li>But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,</li>
  <li>Your buskin’d mistress and your warrior love,</li>
  <li>To Theseus must be wedded, and you come</li>
  <li>To give their bed joy and prosperity.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OBERON">
  <li class="number">How canst thou thus for shame, Titania,</li>
  <li>Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,</li>
  <li>Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?</li>
  <li>Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night</li>
  <li>From Perigenia, whom he ravished?</li>
  <li class="number">And make him with fair AEgle break his faith,</li>
  <li>With Ariadne and Antiopa?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITANIA">
  <li>These are the forgeries of jealousy:</li>
  <li>And never, since the middle summer’s spring,</li>
  <li>Met we on hill, in dale, forest or mead,</li>
  <li class="number">By paved fountain or by rushy brook,</li>
  <li>Or in the beached margent of the sea,</li>
  <li>To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,</li>
  <li>But with thy brawls thou hast disturb’d our sport.</li>
  <li>Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,</li>
  <li class="number">As in revenge, have suck’d up from the sea</li>
  <li>Contagious fogs; which falling in the land</li>
  <li>Have every pelting river made so proud</li>
  <li>That they have overborne their continents:</li>
  <li>The ox hath therefore stretch’d his yoke in vain,</li>
  <li class="number">The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn</li>
  <li>Hath rotted ere his youth attain’d a beard;</li>
  <li>The fold stands empty in the drowned field,</li>
  <li>And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;</li>
  <li>The nine men’s morris is fill’d up with mud,</li>
  <li class="number">And the quaint mazes in the wanton green</li>
  <li>For lack of tread are undistinguishable:</li>
  <li>The human mortals want their winter here;</li>
  <li>No night is now with hymn or carol blest:</li>
  <li>Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,</li>
  <li class="number">Pale in her anger, washes all the air,</li>
  <li>That rheumatic diseases do abound:</li>
  <li>And thorough this distemperature we see</li>
  <li>The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts</li>
  <li>Far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,</li>
  <li class="number">And on old Hiems’ thin and icy crown</li>
  <li>An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds</li>
  <li>Is, as in mockery, set: the spring, the summer,</li>
  <li>The childing autumn, angry winter, change</li>
  <li>Their wonted liveries, and the mazed world,</li>
  <li class="number">By their increase, now knows not which is which:</li>
  <li>And this same progeny of evils comes</li>
  <li>From our debate, from our dissension;</li>
  <li>We are their parents and original.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OBERON">
  <li>Do you amend it then; it lies in you:</li>
  <li class="number">Why should Titania cross her Oberon?</li>
  <li>I do but beg a little changeling boy,</li>
  <li>To be my henchman.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITANIA">
  <li>Set your heart at rest:</li>
  <li>The fairy land buys not the child of me.</li>
  <li class="number">His mother was a votaress of my order:</li>
  <li>And, in the spiced Indian air, by night,</li>
  <li>Full often hath she gossip’d by my side,</li>
  <li>And sat with me on Neptune’s yellow sands,</li>
  <li>Marking the embarked traders on the flood,</li>
  <li class="number">When we have laugh’d to see the sails conceive</li>
  <li>And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;</li>
  <li>Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait</li>
  <li>Following — her womb then rich with my young squire — </li>
  <li>Would imitate, and sail upon the land,</li>
  <li class="number">To fetch me trifles, and return again,</li>
  <li>As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.</li>
  <li>But she, being mortal, of that boy did die;</li>
  <li>And for her sake do I rear up her boy,</li>
  <li>And for her sake I will not part with him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OBERON">
  <li class="number">How long within this wood intend you stay?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITANIA">
  <li>Perchance till after Theseus’ wedding-day.</li>
  <li>If you will patiently dance in our round</li>
  <li>And see our moonlight revels, go with us;</li>
  <li>If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OBERON">
  <li class="number">Give me that boy, and I will go with thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITANIA">
  <li>Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away!</li>
  <li>We shall chide downright, if I longer stay.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit TITANIA with her train</div>

<ol data-speaker="OBERON">
  <li>Well, go thy way: thou shalt not from this grove</li>
  <li>Till I torment thee for this injury.</li>
  <li class="number">My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememberest</li>
  <li>Since once I sat upon a promontory,</li>
  <li>And heard a mermaid on a dolphin’s back</li>
  <li>Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath</li>
  <li>That the rude sea grew civil at her song</li>
  <li class="number">And certain stars shot madly from their spheres,</li>
  <li>To hear the sea-maid’s music.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PUCK">
  <li>I remember.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OBERON">
  <li>That very time I saw, but thou couldst not,</li>
  <li>Flying between the cold moon and the earth,</li>
  <li class="number">Cupid all arm’d: a certain aim he took</li>
  <li>At a fair vestal throned by the west,</li>
  <li>And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow,</li>
  <li>As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;</li>
  <li>But I might see young Cupid’s fiery shaft</li>
  <li class="number">Quench’d in the chaste beams of the watery moon,</li>
  <li>And the imperial votaress passed on,</li>
  <li>In maiden meditation, fancy-free.</li>
  <li>Yet mark’d I where the bolt of Cupid fell:</li>
  <li>It fell upon a little western flower,</li>
  <li class="number">Before milk-white, now purple with love’s wound,</li>
  <li>And maidens call it love-in-idleness.</li>
  <li>Fetch me that flower; the herb I shew’d thee once:</li>
  <li>The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid</li>
  <li>Will make or man or woman madly dote</li>
  <li class="number">Upon the next live creature that it sees.</li>
  <li>Fetch me this herb; and be thou here again</li>
  <li>Ere the leviathan can swim a league.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PUCK">
  <li>I’ll put a girdle round about the earth</li>
  <li>In forty minutes.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<ol data-speaker="OBERON">
  <li class="number">Having once this juice,</li>
  <li>I’ll watch Titania when she is asleep,</li>
  <li>And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.</li>
  <li>The next thing then she waking looks upon,</li>
  <li>Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,</li>
  <li class="number">On meddling monkey, or on busy ape,</li>
  <li>She shall pursue it with the soul of love:</li>
  <li>And ere I take this charm from off her sight,</li>
  <li>As I can take it with another herb,</li>
  <li>I’ll make her render up her page to me.</li>
  <li class="number">But who comes here? I am invisible;</li>
  <li>And I will overhear their conference.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter DEMETRIUS, HELENA, following him</div>

<ol data-speaker="DEMETRIUS">
  <li>I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.</li>
  <li>Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?</li>
  <li>The one I’ll slay, the other slayeth me.</li>
  <li class="number">Thou told’st me they were stolen unto this wood;</li>
  <li>And here am I, and wode within this wood,</li>
  <li>Because I cannot meet my Hermia.</li>
  <li>Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant;</li>
  <li class="number">But yet you draw not iron, for my heart</li>
  <li>Is true as steel: leave you your power to draw,</li>
  <li>And I shall have no power to follow you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DEMETRIUS">
  <li>Do I entice you? do I speak you fair?</li>
  <li>Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth</li>
  <li class="number">Tell you, I do not, nor I cannot love you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>And even for that do I love you the more.</li>
  <li>I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius,</li>
  <li>The more you beat me, I will fawn on you:</li>
  <li>Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,</li>
  <li class="number">Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,</li>
  <li>Unworthy as I am, to follow you.</li>
  <li>What worser place can I beg in your love — </li>
  <li>And yet a place of high respect with me — </li>
  <li>Than to be used as you use your dog?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DEMETRIUS">
  <li class="number">Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit;</li>
  <li>For I am sick when I do look on thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>And I am sick when I look not on you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DEMETRIUS">
  <li>You do impeach your modesty too much,</li>
  <li>To leave the city and commit yourself</li>
  <li class="number">Into the hands of one that loves you not;</li>
  <li>To trust the opportunity of night</li>
  <li>And the ill counsel of a desert place</li>
  <li>With the rich worth of your virginity.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>Your virtue is my privilege: for that</li>
  <li class="number">It is not night when I do see your face,</li>
  <li>Therefore I think I am not in the night;</li>
  <li>Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,</li>
  <li>For you in my respect are all the world:</li>
  <li>Then how can it be said I am alone,</li>
  <li class="number">When all the world is here to look on me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DEMETRIUS">
  <li>I’ll run from thee and hide me in the brakes,</li>
  <li>And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>The wildest hath not such a heart as you.</li>
  <li>Run when you will, the story shall be changed:</li>
  <li class="number">Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase;</li>
  <li>The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind</li>
  <li>Makes speed to catch the tiger; bootless speed,</li>
  <li>When cowardice pursues and valour flies.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DEMETRIUS">
  <li>I will not stay thy questions; let me go:</li>
  <li class="number">Or, if thou follow me, do not believe</li>
  <li>But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,</li>
  <li>You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!</li>
  <li>Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:</li>
  <li class="number">We cannot fight for love, as men may do;</li>
  <li>We should be wood and were not made to woo.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exit DEMETRIUS</li>
  <li>I’ll follow thee and make a heaven of hell,</li>
  <li>To die upon the hand I love so well.</li>

  <li>Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,</li>
  <li>With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine:</li>
  <li>There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,</li>
  <li>Lull’d in these flowers with dances and delight;</li>
  <li class="number">And there the snake throws her enamell’d skin,</li>
  <li>Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in:</li>
  <li>And with the juice of this I’ll streak her eyes,</li>
  <li>And make her full of hateful fantasies.</li>
  <li>Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:</li>
  <li class="number">A sweet Athenian lady is in love</li>
  <li>With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes;</li>
  <li>But do it when the next thing he espies</li>
  <li>May be the lady: thou shalt know the man</li>
  <li>By the Athenian garments he hath on.</li>
  <li class="number">Effect it with some care, that he may prove</li>
  <li>More fond on her than she upon her love:</li>

<h3>SCENE I.  The wood. TITANIA lying asleep.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and
STARVELING</div>

<ol data-speaker="BOTTOM">
  <li>Are we all met?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUINCE">
  <li>Pat, pat; and here’s a marvellous convenient place</li>
  <li>for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our</li>
  <li>stage, this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house; and we</li>
  <li class="number">will do it in action as we will do it before the duke.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOTTOM">
  <li>Peter Quince — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUINCE">
  <li>What sayest thou, bully Bottom?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOTTOM">
  <li>There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and</li>
  <li>Thisby that will never please. First, Pyramus must</li>
  <li class="number">draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies</li>
  <li>cannot abide. How answer you that?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SNOUT">
  <li>By’r lakin, a parlous fear.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="STARVELING">
  <li>I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOTTOM">
  <li>Not a whit: I have a device to make all well.</li>
  <li class="number">Write me a prologue; and let the prologue seem to</li>
  <li>say, we will do no harm with our swords, and that</li>
  <li>Pyramus is not killed indeed; and, for the more</li>
  <li>better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not</li>
  <li>Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver: this will put them</li>
  <li class="number">out of fear.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUINCE">
  <li>Well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be</li>
  <li>written in eight and six.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOTTOM">
  <li>No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SNOUT">
  <li>Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="STARVELING">
  <li class="number">I fear it, I promise you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOTTOM">
  <li>Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves: to</li>
  <li>bring in — God shield us! — a lion among ladies, is a</li>
  <li>most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful</li>
  <li>wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to</li>
  <li class="number">look to ’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SNOUT">
  <li>Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOTTOM">
  <li>Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must</li>
  <li>be seen through the lion’s neck: and he himself</li>
  <li>must speak through, saying thus, or to the same</li>
  <li class="number">defect — ’Ladies,’ — or ’Fair-ladies — I would wish</li>
  <li>You,’ — or ’I would request you,’ — or ’I would</li>
  <li>entreat you — not to fear, not to tremble: my life</li>
  <li>for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it</li>
  <li>were pity of my life: no I am no such thing; I am a</li>
  <li class="number">man as other men are;’ and there indeed let him name</li>
  <li>his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUINCE">
  <li>Well it shall be so. But there is two hard things;</li>
  <li>that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for,</li>
  <li>you know, Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SNOUT">
  <li class="number">Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOTTOM">
  <li>A calendar, a calendar! look in the almanac; find</li>
  <li>out moonshine, find out moonshine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUINCE">
  <li>Yes, it doth shine that night.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOTTOM">
  <li>Why, then may you leave a casement of the great</li>
  <li class="number">chamber window, where we play, open, and the moon</li>
  <li>may shine in at the casement.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUINCE">
  <li>Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns</li>
  <li>and a lanthorn, and say he comes to disfigure, or to</li>
  <li>present, the person of Moonshine. Then, there is</li>
  <li class="number">another thing: we must have a wall in the great</li>
  <li>chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby says the story, did</li>
  <li>talk through the chink of a wall.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SNOUT">
  <li>You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOTTOM">
  <li>Some man or other must present Wall: and let him</li>
  <li class="number">have some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast</li>
  <li>about him, to signify wall; and let him hold his</li>
  <li>fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus</li>
  <li>and Thisby whisper.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUINCE">
  <li>If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down,</li>
  <li class="number">every mother’s son, and rehearse your parts.</li>
  <li>Pyramus, you begin: when you have spoken your</li>
  <li>speech, enter into that brake: and so every one</li>
  <li>according to his cue.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter PUCK behind</div>

  <li>It cannot be but thou hast murder’d him;</li>

  <li>O, once tell true, tell true, even for my sake!</li>

  <li>Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?</li>

  <li>What thought I be not so in grace as you,</li>

  <li>I have no gift at all in shrewishness;</li>
  <li>I am a right maid for my cowardice:</li>
  <li class="number">Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think,</li>

  <li class="number">But he hath chid me hence and threaten’d me</li>
  <li>To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too:</li>
  <li>And now, so you will let me quiet go,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERMIA">
  <li>Why, get you gone: who is’t that hinders you?</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELENA">
  <li>O, when she’s angry, she is keen and shrewd!</li>

  <li>Already to their wormy beds are gone;</li>
  <li>For fear lest day should look their shames upon,</li>
  <li>They willfully themselves exile from light</li>

  <li>For, meeting her of late behind the wood,</li>
  <li>Seeking sweet favours from this hateful fool,</li>
  <li class="number">I did upbraid her and fall out with her;</li>

  <li>And that same dew, which sometime on the buds</li>
  <li>Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls,</li>
  <li class="number">Stood now within the pretty flowerets’ eyes</li>
  <li>Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.</li>
  <li>When I had at my pleasure taunted her</li>

  <li>I then did ask of her her changeling child;</li>
  <li class="number">Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent</li>
  <li>To bear him to my bower in fairy land.</li>
  <li>And now I have the boy, I will undo</li>
  <li>This hateful imperfection of her eyes:</li>
  <li>And, gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp</li>
  <li class="number">From off the head of this Athenian swain;</li>
  <li>That, he awaking when the other do,</li>
  <li>May all to Athens back again repair</li>
  <li>And think no more of this night’s accidents</li>

  <li>I was with Hercules and Cadmus once,</li>
  <li class="number">When in a wood of Crete they bay’d the bear</li>
  <li>With hounds of Sparta: never did I hear</li>
  <li>Such gallant chiding: for, besides the groves,</li>
  <li>The skies, the fountains, every region near</li>
  <li>Seem’d all one mutual cry: I never heard</li>
  <li class="number">So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THESEUS">
  <li>My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,</li>
  <li>So flew’d, so sanded, and their heads are hung</li>
  <li>With ears that sweep away the morning dew;</li>
  <li>Crook-knee’d, and dew-lapp’d like Thessalian bulls;</li>
  <li class="number">Slow in pursuit, but match’d in mouth like bells,</li>
  <li>Each under each. A cry more tuneable</li>
  <li>Was never holla’d to, nor cheer’d with horn,</li>
  <li>In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly:</li>

<ol data-speaker="LYSANDER">
  <li>My lord, I shall reply amazedly,</li>

  <li>But, as I think — for truly would I speak,</li>
  <li>And now do I bethink me, so it is — </li>
  <li>I came with Hermia hither: our intent</li>

  <li>Without the peril of the Athenian law.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EGEUS">
  <li>Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:</li>
  <li>I beg the law, the law, upon his head.</li>
  <li>They would have stolen away; they would, Demetrius,</li>
  <li class="number">Thereby to have defeated you and me,</li>
  <li>You of your wife and me of my consent,</li>
  <li>Of my consent that she should be your wife.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DEMETRIUS">
  <li>My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,</li>
  <li>Of this their purpose hither to this wood;</li>

  <li>But, my good lord, I wot not by what power — </li>
  <li>But by some power it is — my love to Hermia,</li>
  <li>Melted as the snow, seems to me now</li>
  <li class="number">As the remembrance of an idle gaud</li>
  <li>Which in my childhood I did dote upon;</li>
  <li>And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,</li>
  <li>The object and the pleasure of mine eye,</li>
  <li>Is only Helena. To her, my lord,</li>
  <li class="number">Was I betroth’d ere I saw Hermia:</li>
  <li>But, like in sickness, did I loathe this food;</li>
  <li>But, as in health, come to my natural taste,</li>
  <li>Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,</li>
  <li>And will for evermore be true to it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THESEUS">
  <li class="number">Fair lovers, you are fortunately met:</li>
  <li>Of this discourse we more will hear anon.</li>
  <li>Egeus, I will overbear your will;</li>
  <li>For in the temple by and by with us</li>
  <li>These couples shall eternally be knit:</li>
  <li class="number">And, for the morning now is something worn,</li>
  <li>Our purposed hunting shall be set aside.</li>
  <li>Away with us to Athens; three and three,</li>
  <li>We’ll hold a feast in great solemnity.</li>

<ol data-speaker="DEMETRIUS">
  <li>Are you sure</li>
  <li>That we are awake? It seems to me</li>

<ol data-speaker="HIPPOLYTA">
  <li>’Tis strange my Theseus, that these</li>
  <li>lovers speak of.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THESEUS">
  <li>More strange than true: I never may believe</li>
  <li>These antique fables, nor these fairy toys.</li>
  <li class="number">Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,</li>
  <li>Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend</li>
  <li>More than cool reason ever comprehends.</li>
  <li>The lunatic, the lover and the poet</li>
  <li>Are of imagination all compact:</li>
  <li class="number">One sees more devils than vast hell can hold,</li>
  <li>That is, the madman: the lover, all as frantic,</li>
  <li>Sees Helen’s beauty in a brow of Egypt:</li>
  <li>The poet’s eye, in fine frenzy rolling,</li>
  <li>Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;</li>
  <li class="number">And as imagination bodies forth</li>
  <li>The forms of things unknown, the poet’s pen</li>
  <li>Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing</li>
  <li>A local habitation and a name.</li>
  <li>Such tricks hath strong imagination,</li>
  <li class="number">That if it would but apprehend some joy,</li>
  <li>It comprehends some bringer of that joy;</li>
  <li>Or in the night, imagining some fear,</li>
  <li>How easy is a bush supposed a bear!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HIPPOLYTA">
  <li>But all the story of the night told over,</li>
  <li class="number">And all their minds transfigured so together,</li>
  <li>More witnesseth than fancy’s images</li>
  <li>And grows to something of great constancy;</li>

  <li class="stage-direction">Reads</li>
  <li class="number">’The thrice three Muses mourning for the death</li>

<ol data-speaker="PHILOSTRATE">
  <li>A play there is, my lord, some ten words long,</li>
  <li class="number">Which is as brief as I have known a play;</li>
  <li>But by ten words, my lord, it is too long,</li>
  <li>Which makes it tedious; for in all the play</li>
  <li>There is not one word apt, one player fitted:</li>
  <li>And tragical, my noble lord, it is;</li>
  <li class="number">For Pyramus therein doth kill himself.</li>
  <li>Which, when I saw rehearsed, I must confess,</li>
  <li>Made mine eyes water; but more merry tears</li>
  <li>The passion of loud laughter never shed.</li>

<ol data-speaker="THESEUS">
  <li>And we will hear it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PHILOSTRATE">
  <li class="number">No, my noble lord;</li>
  <li>It is not for you: I have heard it over,</li>
  <li>And it is nothing, nothing in the world;</li>
  <li>Unless you can find sport in their intents,</li>

  <li>He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows</li>

  <li>enough to speak, but to speak true.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HIPPOLYTA">
  <li>Indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child</li>
  <li>on a recorder; a sound, but not in government.</li>

  <li>Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;</li>

  <li>This man is Pyramus, if you would know;</li>
  <li>This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.</li>
  <li class="number">This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present</li>
  <li>Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;</li>
  <li>And through Wall’s chink, poor souls, they are content</li>
  <li>To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.</li>
  <li>This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,</li>
  <li class="number">Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,</li>
  <li>By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn</li>
  <li>To meet at Ninus’ tomb, there, there to woo.</li>
  <li>This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,</li>
  <li>The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,</li>
  <li class="number">Did scare away, or rather did affright;</li>
  <li>And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall,</li>
  <li>Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.</li>
  <li>Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,</li>
  <li>And finds his trusty Thisby’s mantle slain:</li>
  <li class="number">Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,</li>
  <li>He bravely broach’d is boiling bloody breast;</li>
  <li>And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,</li>
  <li>His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,</li>

<ol data-speaker="Wall">
  <li>In this same interlude it doth befall</li>
  <li>That I, one Snout by name, present a wall;</li>

  <li>That had in it a crannied hole or chink,</li>
  <li>Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,</li>
  <li>Did whisper often very secretly.</li>
  <li>This loam, this rough-cast and this stone doth show</li>
  <li class="number">That I am that same wall; the truth is so:</li>
  <li>And this the cranny is, right and sinister,</li>
  <li>Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.</li>

<ol data-speaker="Pyramus">
  <li class="number">No, in truth, sir, he should not. ’Deceiving me’</li>

  <li class="number">No die, but an ace, for him; for he is but one.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LYSANDER">
  <li>Less than an ace, man; for he is dead; he is nothing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THESEUS">
  <li>With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover, and</li>
  <li>prove an ass.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HIPPOLYTA">
  <li>How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes</li>
  <li class="number">back and finds her lover?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THESEUS">
  <li>She will find him by starlight. Here she comes; and</li>
  <li>her passion ends the play.</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Re-enter Thisbe</div>

<ol data-speaker="HIPPOLYTA">
  <li>Methinks she should not use a long one for such a</li>

  <li class="number">A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which</li>

<ol data-speaker="LYSANDER">
  <li>She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.</li>

<ol data-speaker="Thisbe">
  <li class="number">Asleep, my love?</li>
  <li>What, dead, my dove?</li>
  <li>O Pyramus, arise!</li>
  <li>Speak, speak. Quite dumb?</li>
  <li>Dead, dead? A tomb</li>
  <li class="number">Must cover thy sweet eyes.</li>
  <li>These My lips,</li>
  <li>This cherry nose,</li>
  <li>These yellow cowslip cheeks,</li>
  <li>Are gone, are gone:</li>
  <li class="number">Lovers, make moan:</li>
  <li>His eyes were green as leeks.</li>
  <li>O Sisters Three,</li>
  <li>Come, come to me,</li>
  <li>With hands as pale as milk;</li>
  <li class="number">Lay them in gore,</li>
  <li>Since you have shore</li>
  <li>With shears his thread of silk.</li>
  <li>Tongue, not a word:</li>
  <li>Come, trusty sword;</li>
  <li class="number">Come, blade, my breast imbrue:</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Stabs herself</li>

  <li>Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.</li>

<ol data-speaker="BOTTOM">
  <li><stagedir>Starting up</stagedir>  No assure you; the wall is down that</li>

  <li>epilogue, or to hear a Bergomask dance between two</li>
  <li>of our company?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THESEUS">
  <li class="number">No epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs no</li>
  <li>excuse. Never excuse; for when the players are all</li>
  <li>dead, there needs none to be blamed. Marry, if he</li>
  <li>that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself</li>
  <li>in Thisbe’s garter, it would have been a fine</li>
  <li class="number">tragedy: and so it is, truly; and very notably</li>
  <li>discharged. But come, your Bergomask: let your</li>
  <li>epilogue alone.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">A dance</li>
  <li>The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve:</li>
  <li>Lovers, to bed; ’tis almost fairy time.</li>
  <li class="number">I fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn</li>
  <li>As much as we this night have overwatch’d.</li>
  <li>This palpable-gross play hath well beguiled</li>
  <li>The heavy gait of night. Sweet friends, to bed.</li>
  <li>A fortnight hold we this solemnity,</li>
  <li class="number">In nightly revels and new jollity.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt</div>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter PUCK</div>

<ol data-speaker="PUCK">
  <li>Now the hungry lion roars,</li>
  <li>And the wolf behowls the moon;</li>
  <li>Whilst the heavy ploughman snores,</li>
  <li>All with weary task fordone.</li>
  <li class="number">Now the wasted brands do glow,</li>
  <li>Whilst the screech-owl, screeching loud,</li>
  <li>Puts the wretch that lies in woe</li>
  <li>In remembrance of a shroud.</li>
  <li>Now it is the time of night</li>
  <li class="number">That the graves all gaping wide,</li>
  <li>Every one lets forth his sprite,</li>
  <li>In the church-way paths to glide:</li>
  <li>And we fairies, that do run</li>
  <li>By the triple Hecate’s team,</li>
  <li class="number">From the presence of the sun,</li>
  <li>Following darkness like a dream,</li>
  <li>Now are frolic: not a mouse</li>
  <li>Shall disturb this hallow’d house:</li>
  <li>I am sent with broom before,</li>
  <li class="number">To sweep the dust behind the door.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter OBERON and TITANIA with their train</div>

<ol data-speaker="OBERON">
  <li>Through the house give gathering light,</li>
  <li>By the dead and drowsy fire:</li>
  <li>Every elf and fairy sprite</li>
  <li>Hop as light as bird from brier;</li>
  <li class="number">And this ditty, after me,</li>
  <li>Sing, and dance it trippingly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITANIA">
  <li>First, rehearse your song by rote</li>
  <li>To each word a warbling note:</li>
  <li>Hand in hand, with fairy grace,</li>
  <li class="number">Will we sing, and bless this place.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Song and dance</div>

<ol data-speaker="OBERON">
  <li>Now, until the break of day,</li>
  <li>Through this house each fairy stray.</li>
  <li>To the best bride-bed will we,</li>
  <li>Which by us shall blessed be;</li>
  <li class="number">And the issue there create</li>
  <li>Ever shall be fortunate.</li>
  <li>So shall all the couples three</li>
  <li>Ever true in loving be;</li>
  <li>And the blots of Nature’s hand</li>
  <li class="number">Shall not in their issue stand;</li>
  <li>Never mole, hare lip, nor scar,</li>
  <li>Nor mark prodigious, such as are</li>
  <li>Despised in nativity,</li>
  <li>Shall upon their children be.</li>
  <li class="number">With this field-dew consecrate,</li>
  <li>Every fairy take his gait;</li>
  <li>And each several chamber bless,</li>
  <li>Through this palace, with sweet peace;</li>
  <li>And the owner of it blest</li>
  <li class="number">Ever shall in safety rest.</li>
  <li>Trip away; make no stay;</li>
  <li>Meet me all by break of day.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt OBERON, TITANIA, and train</div>

<ol data-speaker="PUCK">
  <li>If we shadows have offended,</li>
  <li>Think but this, and all is mended,</li>
  <li class="number">That you have but slumber’d here</li>
  <li>While these visions did appear.</li>
  <li>And this weak and idle theme,</li>
  <li>No more yielding but a dream,</li>
  <li>Gentles, do not reprehend:</li>
  <li class="number">if you pardon, we will mend:</li>
  <li>And, as I am an honest Puck,</li>
  <li>If we have unearned luck</li>
  <li>Now to ’scape the serpent’s tongue,</li>
  <li>We will make amends ere long;</li>
  <li class="number">Else the Puck a liar call;</li>
  <li>So, good night unto you all.</li>
  <li>Give me your hands, if we be friends,</li>
  <li>And Robin shall restore amends.</li>
