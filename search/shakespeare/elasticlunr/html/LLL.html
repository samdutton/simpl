<h3>SCENE I.  The king of Navarre’s park.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter FERDINAND king of Navarre, BIRON, LONGAVILLE
and DUMAIN</div>

<ol data-speaker="FERDINAND">
  <li>Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,</li>
  <li>Live register’d upon our brazen tombs</li>
  <li>And then grace us in the disgrace of death;</li>
  <li>When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,</li>
  <li class="number">The endeavor of this present breath may buy</li>
  <li>That honour which shall bate his scythe’s keen edge</li>
  <li>And make us heirs of all eternity.</li>
  <li>Therefore, brave conquerors — for so you are,</li>
  <li>That war against your own affections</li>
  <li class="number">And the huge army of the world’s desires — </li>
  <li>Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:</li>
  <li>Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;</li>
  <li>Our court shall be a little Academe,</li>
  <li>Still and contemplative in living art.</li>
  <li class="number">You three, Biron, Dumain, and Longaville,</li>
  <li>Have sworn for three years’ term to live with me</li>
  <li>My fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes</li>
  <li>That are recorded in this schedule here:</li>
  <li>Your oaths are pass’d; and now subscribe your names,</li>
  <li class="number">That his own hand may strike his honour down</li>
  <li>That violates the smallest branch herein:</li>
  <li>If you are arm’d to do as sworn to do,</li>
  <li>Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LONGAVILLE">
  <li>I am resolved; ’tis but a three years’ fast:</li>
  <li class="number">The mind shall banquet, though the body pine:</li>
  <li>Fat paunches have lean pates, and dainty bits</li>
  <li>Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUMAIN">
  <li>My loving lord, Dumain is mortified:</li>
  <li>The grosser manner of these world’s delights</li>
  <li class="number">He throws upon the gross world’s baser slaves:</li>
  <li>To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die;</li>
  <li>With all these living in philosophy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">
  <li>I can but say their protestation over;</li>
  <li>So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,</li>
  <li class="number">That is, to live and study here three years.</li>
  <li>But there are other strict observances;</li>
  <li>As, not to see a woman in that term,</li>
  <li>Which I hope well is not enrolled there;</li>
  <li>And one day in a week to touch no food</li>
  <li class="number">And but one meal on every day beside,</li>
  <li>The which I hope is not enrolled there;</li>
  <li>And then, to sleep but three hours in the night,</li>
  <li>And not be seen to wink of all the day — </li>
  <li>When I was wont to think no harm all night</li>
  <li class="number">And make a dark night too of half the day — </li>
  <li>Which I hope well is not enrolled there:</li>
  <li>O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,</li>
  <li>Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FERDINAND">
  <li>Your oath is pass’d to pass away from these.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">
  <li class="number">Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:</li>
  <li>I only swore to study with your grace</li>
  <li>And stay here in your court for three years’ space.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LONGAVILLE">
  <li>You swore to that, Biron, and to the rest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">
  <li>By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.</li>
  <li class="number">What is the end of study? let me know.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FERDINAND">
  <li>Why, that to know, which else we should not know.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">
  <li>Things hid and barr’d, you mean, from common sense?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FERDINAND">
  <li>Ay, that is study’s godlike recompense.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">
  <li>Come on, then; I will swear to study so,</li>
  <li class="number">To know the thing I am forbid to know:</li>
  <li>As thus — to study where I well may dine,</li>
  <li>When I to feast expressly am forbid;</li>
  <li>Or study where to meet some mistress fine,</li>
  <li>When mistresses from common sense are hid;</li>
  <li class="number">Or, having sworn too hard a keeping oath,</li>
  <li>Study to break it and not break my troth.</li>
  <li>If study’s gain be thus and this be so,</li>
  <li>Study knows that which yet it doth not know:</li>
  <li>Swear me to this, and I will ne’er say no.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FERDINAND">
  <li class="number">These be the stops that hinder study quite</li>
  <li>And train our intellects to vain delight.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">
  <li>Why, all delights are vain; but that most vain,</li>
  <li>Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain:</li>
  <li>As, painfully to pore upon a book</li>
  <li class="number">To seek the light of truth; while truth the while</li>
  <li>Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:</li>
  <li>Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:</li>
  <li>So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,</li>
  <li>Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.</li>
  <li class="number">Study me how to please the eye indeed</li>
  <li>By fixing it upon a fairer eye,</li>
  <li>Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed</li>
  <li>And give him light that it was blinded by.</li>
  <li>Study is like the heaven’s glorious sun</li>
  <li class="number">That will not be deep-search’d with saucy looks:</li>
  <li>Small have continual plodders ever won</li>
  <li>Save base authority from others’ books</li>
  <li>These earthly godfathers of heaven’s lights</li>
  <li>That give a name to every fixed star</li>
  <li class="number">Have no more profit of their shining nights</li>
  <li>Than those that walk and wot not what they are.</li>
  <li>Too much to know is to know nought but fame;</li>
  <li>And every godfather can give a name.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FERDINAND">
  <li>How well he’s read, to reason against reading!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUMAIN">
  <li class="number">Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LONGAVILLE">
  <li>He weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">
  <li>The spring is near when green geese are a-breeding.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUMAIN">
  <li>How follows that?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">
  <li>Fit in his place and time.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUMAIN">
  <li class="number">In reason nothing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">
  <li>Something then in rhyme.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FERDINAND">
  <li>Biron is like an envious sneaping frost,</li>
  <li>That bites the first-born infants of the spring.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">
  <li>Well, say I am; why should proud summer boast</li>
  <li class="number">Before the birds have any cause to sing?</li>
  <li>Why should I joy in any abortive birth?</li>
  <li>At Christmas I no more desire a rose</li>
  <li>Than wish a snow in May’s new-fangled mirth;</li>
  <li>But like of each thing that in season grows.</li>
  <li class="number">So you, to study now it is too late,</li>
  <li>Climb o’er the house to unlock the little gate.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FERDINAND">
  <li>Well, sit you out: go home, Biron: adieu.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">
  <li>No, my good lord; I have sworn to stay with you:</li>
  <li>And though I have for barbarism spoke more</li>
  <li class="number">Than for that angel knowledge you can say,</li>
  <li>Yet confident I’ll keep what I have swore</li>
  <li>And bide the penance of each three years’ day.</li>
  <li>Give me the paper; let me read the same;</li>
  <li>And to the strict’st decrees I’ll write my name.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FERDINAND">
  <li class="number">How well this yielding rescues thee from shame!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">
  <li><span class="stage-direction">Reads</span>  ’Item, That no woman shall come within a</li>
  <li>mile of my court:’ Hath this been proclaimed?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LONGAVILLE">
  <li>Four days ago.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">
  <li>Let’s see the penalty.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Reads</li>
  <li class="number">’On pain of losing her tongue.’ Who devised this penalty?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LONGAVILLE">
  <li>Marry, that did I.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">
  <li>Sweet lord, and why?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LONGAVILLE">
  <li>To fright them hence with that dread penalty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">
  <li>A dangerous law against gentility!</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Reads</li>
  <li class="number">’Item, If any man be seen to talk with a woman</li>
  <li>within the term of three years, he shall endure such</li>
  <li>public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise.’</li>
  <li>This article, my liege, yourself must break;</li>
  <li>For well you know here comes in embassy</li>
  <li class="number">The French king’s daughter with yourself to speak — </li>
  <li>A maid of grace and complete majesty — </li>
  <li>About surrender up of Aquitaine</li>
  <li>To her decrepit, sick and bedrid father:</li>
  <li>Therefore this article is made in vain,</li>
  <li class="number">Or vainly comes the admired princess hither.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FERDINAND">
  <li>What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">
  <li>So study evermore is overshot:</li>
  <li>While it doth study to have what it would</li>
  <li>It doth forget to do the thing it should,</li>
  <li class="number">And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,</li>
  <li>’Tis won as towns with fire, so won, so lost.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FERDINAND">
  <li>We must of force dispense with this decree;</li>
  <li>She must lie here on mere necessity.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">
  <li>Necessity will make us all forsworn</li>
  <li class="number">Three thousand times within this three years’ space;</li>
  <li>For every man with his affects is born,</li>
  <li>Not by might master’d but by special grace:</li>
  <li>If I break faith, this word shall speak for me;</li>
  <li>I am forsworn on ’mere necessity.’</li>
  <li class="number">So to the laws at large I write my name:</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Subscribes</li>
  <li>And he that breaks them in the least degree</li>
  <li>Stands in attainder of eternal shame:</li>
  <li>Suggestions are to other as to me;</li>
  <li>But I believe, although I seem so loath,</li>
  <li class="number">I am the last that will last keep his oath.</li>
  <li>But is there no quick recreation granted?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FERDINAND">
  <li>Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted</li>
  <li>With a refined traveller of Spain;</li>
  <li>A man in all the world’s new fashion planted,</li>
  <li class="number">That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;</li>
  <li>One whom the music of his own vain tongue</li>
  <li>Doth ravish like enchanting harmony;</li>
  <li>A man of complements, whom right and wrong</li>
  <li>Have chose as umpire of their mutiny:</li>
  <li class="number">This child of fancy, that Armado hight,</li>
  <li>For interim to our studies shall relate</li>
  <li>In high-born words the worth of many a knight</li>
  <li>From tawny Spain lost in the world’s debate.</li>
  <li>How you delight, my lords, I know not, I;</li>
  <li class="number">But, I protest, I love to hear him lie</li>
  <li>And I will use him for my minstrelsy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">
  <li>Armado is a most illustrious wight,</li>
  <li>A man of fire-new words, fashion’s own knight.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LONGAVILLE">
  <li>Costard the swain and he shall be our sport;</li>
  <li class="number">And so to study, three years is but short.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter DULL with a letter, and COSTARD</div>

<ol data-speaker="DULL">
  <li>Which is the duke’s own person?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">
  <li>This, fellow: what wouldst?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DULL">
  <li>I myself reprehend his own person, for I am his</li>
  <li>grace’s tharborough: but I would see his own person</li>
  <li class="number">in flesh and blood.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">
  <li>This is he.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DULL">
  <li>Signior Arme — Arme — commends you. There’s villany</li>
  <li>abroad: this letter will tell you more.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COSTARD">
  <li>Sir, the contempts thereof are as touching me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FERDINAND">
  <li class="number">A letter from the magnificent Armado.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">
  <li>How low soever the matter, I hope in God for high words.</li>

<ol data-speaker="LONGAVILLE">
  <li>A high hope for a low heaven: God grant us patience!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">
  <li>To hear? or forbear laughing?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LONGAVILLE">
  <li>To hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately; or to</li>
  <li class="number">forbear both.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">
  <li>Well, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause to</li>
  <li>climb in the merriness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COSTARD">
  <li>The matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta.</li>
  <li>The manner of it is, I was taken with the manner.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">
  <li class="number">In what manner?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COSTARD">
  <li>In manner and form following, sir; all those three:</li>
  <li>I was seen with her in the manor-house, sitting with</li>
  <li>her upon the form, and taken following her into the</li>
  <li>park; which, put together, is in manner and form</li>
  <li class="number">following. Now, sir, for the manner — it is the</li>
  <li>manner of a man to speak to a woman: for the form — </li>
  <li>in some form.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">
  <li>For the following, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COSTARD">
  <li>As it shall follow in my correction: and God defend</li>
  <li class="number">the right!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FERDINAND">
  <li>Will you hear this letter with attention?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">
  <li>As we would hear an oracle.</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  The same.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO and MOTH</div>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>Boy, what sign is it when a man of great spirit</li>
  <li>grows melancholy?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>Why, sadness is one and the self-same thing, dear imp.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li class="number">No, no; O Lord, sir, no.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>How canst thou part sadness and melancholy, my</li>
  <li>tender juvenal?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>By a familiar demonstration of the working, my tough senior.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>Why tough senior? why tough senior?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li class="number">Why tender juvenal? why tender juvenal?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton</li>
  <li>appertaining to thy young days, which we may</li>
  <li>nominate tender.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>And I, tough senior, as an appertinent title to your</li>
  <li class="number">old time, which we may name tough.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>Pretty and apt.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>How mean you, sir? I pretty, and my saying apt? or</li>
  <li>I apt, and my saying pretty?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>Thou pretty, because little.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li class="number">Little pretty, because little. Wherefore apt?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>And therefore apt, because quick.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>Speak you this in my praise, master?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>In thy condign praise.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>I will praise an eel with the same praise.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li class="number">What, that an eel is ingenious?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>That an eel is quick.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>I do say thou art quick in answers: thou heatest my blood.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>I am answered, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>I love not to be crossed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li class="number"><span class="stage-direction">Aside</span>  He speaks the mere contrary; crosses love not him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>I have promised to study three years with the duke.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>You may do it in an hour, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>Impossible.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>How many is one thrice told?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li class="number">I am ill at reckoning; it fitteth the spirit of a tapster.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>I confess both: they are both the varnish of a</li>
  <li>complete man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>Then, I am sure, you know how much the gross sum of</li>
  <li class="number">deuce-ace amounts to.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>It doth amount to one more than two.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>Which the base vulgar do call three.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>True.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>Why, sir, is this such a piece of study? Now here</li>
  <li class="number">is three studied, ere ye’ll thrice wink: and how</li>
  <li>easy it is to put ’years’ to the word ’three,’ and</li>
  <li>study three years in two words, the dancing horse</li>
  <li>will tell you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>A most fine figure!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li class="number">To prove you a cipher.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>I will hereupon confess I am in love: and as it is</li>
  <li>base for a soldier to love, so am I in love with a</li>
  <li>base wench. If drawing my sword against the humour</li>
  <li>of affection would deliver me from the reprobate</li>
  <li class="number">thought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, and</li>
  <li>ransom him to any French courtier for a new-devised</li>
  <li>courtesy. I think scorn to sigh: methinks I should</li>
  <li>outswear Cupid. Comfort, me, boy: what great men</li>
  <li>have been in love?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li class="number">Hercules, master.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name</li>
  <li>more; and, sweet my child, let them be men of good</li>
  <li>repute and carriage.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>Samson, master: he was a man of good carriage, great</li>
  <li class="number">carriage, for he carried the town-gates on his back</li>
  <li>like a porter: and he was in love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>O well-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson! I do</li>
  <li>excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in</li>
  <li>carrying gates. I am in love too. Who was Samson’s</li>
  <li class="number">love, my dear Moth?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>A woman, master.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>Of what complexion?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the four.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>Tell me precisely of what complexion.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li class="number">Of the sea-water green, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>Is that one of the four complexions?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>As I have read, sir; and the best of them too.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>Green indeed is the colour of lovers; but to have a</li>
  <li>love of that colour, methinks Samson had small reason</li>
  <li class="number">for it. He surely affected her for her wit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>It was so, sir; for she had a green wit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>My love is most immaculate white and red.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>Most maculate thoughts, master, are masked under</li>
  <li>such colours.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li class="number">Define, define, well-educated infant.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>My father’s wit and my mother’s tongue, assist me!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>Sweet invocation of a child; most pretty and</li>
  <li>pathetical!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>If she be made of white and red,</li>
  <li class="number">Her faults will ne’er be known,</li>
  <li>For blushing cheeks by faults are bred</li>
  <li>And fears by pale white shown:</li>
  <li>Then if she fear, or be to blame,</li>
  <li>By this you shall not know,</li>
  <li class="number">For still her cheeks possess the same</li>
  <li>Which native she doth owe.</li>
  <li>A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of</li>
  <li>white and red.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>Is there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the Beggar?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li class="number">The world was very guilty of such a ballad some</li>
  <li>three ages since: but I think now ’tis not to be</li>
  <li>found; or, if it were, it would neither serve for</li>
  <li>the writing nor the tune.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>I will have that subject newly writ o’er, that I may</li>
  <li class="number">example my digression by some mighty precedent.</li>
  <li>Boy, I do love that country girl that I took in the</li>
  <li>park with the rational hind Costard: she deserves well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li><span class="stage-direction">Aside</span>  To be whipped; and yet a better love than</li>
  <li>my master.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li class="number">Sing, boy; my spirit grows heavy in love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>And that’s great marvel, loving a light wench.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>I say, sing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>Forbear till this company be past.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter DULL, COSTARD, and JAQUENETTA</div>

<ol data-speaker="DULL">
  <li>Sir, the duke’s pleasure is, that you keep Costard</li>
  <li class="number">safe: and you must suffer him to take no delight</li>
  <li>nor no penance; but a’ must fast three days a week.</li>
  <li>For this damsel, I must keep her at the park: she</li>
  <li>is allowed for the day-woman. Fare you well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>I do betray myself with blushing. Maid!</li>
</ol>

  <li>I will visit thee at the lodge.</li>

  <li>That’s hereby.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>I know where it is situate.</li>

<ol data-speaker="JAQUENETTA">
  <li>Lord, how wise you are!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li class="number">I will tell thee wonders.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JAQUENETTA">
  <li>With that face?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>I love thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JAQUENETTA">
  <li>So I heard you say.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>And so, farewell.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JAQUENETTA">
  <li class="number">Fair weather after you!</li>

<ol data-speaker="DULL">
  <li>Come, Jaquenetta, away!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt DULL and JAQUENETTA</div>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>Villain, thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COSTARD">
  <li>Well, sir, I hope, when I do it, I shall do it on a</li>
  <li class="number">full stomach.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>Thou shalt be heavily punished.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COSTARD">
  <li>I am more bound to you than your fellows, for they</li>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>Take away this villain; shut him up.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li class="number">Come, you transgressing slave; away!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COSTARD">
  <li>Let me not be pent up, sir: I will fast, being loose.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>No, sir; that were fast and loose: thou shalt to prison.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COSTARD">
  <li>Well, if ever I do see the merry days of desolation</li>
  <li>that I have seen, some shall see.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li class="number">What shall some see?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COSTARD">
  <li>Nay, nothing, Master Moth, but what they look upon.</li>
  <li>It is not for prisoners to be too silent in their</li>
  <li>words; and therefore I will say nothing: I thank</li>
  <li>God I have as little patience as another man; and</li>

  <li>I do affect the very ground, which is base, where</li>

  <li>is a great argument of falsehood, if I love. And</li>
  <li class="number">how can that be true love which is falsely</li>
  <li>attempted? Love is a familiar; Love is a devil:</li>
  <li>there is no evil angel but Love. Yet was Samson so</li>
  <li>tempted, and he had an excellent strength; yet was</li>
  <li>Solomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit.</li>
  <li class="number">Cupid’s butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules’ club;</li>
  <li>and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard’s rapier.</li>
  <li>The first and second cause will not serve my turn;</li>
  <li>the passado he respects not, the duello he regards</li>
  <li>not: his disgrace is to be called boy; but his</li>

  <li>be still, drum! for your manager is in love; yea,</li>

<h3>SCENE I.  The same.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter the PRINCESS of France, ROSALINE, MARIA,
KATHARINE, BOYET, Lords, and other Attendants</div>

<ol data-speaker="BOYET">
  <li>Now, madam, summon up your dearest spirits:</li>
  <li>Consider who the king your father sends,</li>
  <li>To whom he sends, and what’s his embassy:</li>
  <li>Yourself, held precious in the world’s esteem,</li>
  <li class="number">To parley with the sole inheritor</li>
  <li>Of all perfections that a man may owe,</li>
  <li>Matchless Navarre; the plea of no less weight</li>
  <li>Than Aquitaine, a dowry for a queen.</li>
  <li>Be now as prodigal of all dear grace</li>
  <li class="number">As Nature was in making graces dear</li>
  <li>When she did starve the general world beside</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCESS">
  <li>Good Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean,</li>
  <li>Needs not the painted flourish of your praise:</li>
  <li class="number">Beauty is bought by judgement of the eye,</li>
  <li>Not utter’d by base sale of chapmen’s tongues:</li>
  <li>I am less proud to hear you tell my worth</li>
  <li>Than you much willing to be counted wise</li>
  <li>In spending your wit in the praise of mine.</li>
  <li class="number">But now to task the tasker: good Boyet,</li>
  <li>You are not ignorant, all-telling fame</li>
  <li>Doth noise abroad, Navarre hath made a vow,</li>
  <li>Till painful study shall outwear three years,</li>
  <li>No woman may approach his silent court:</li>
  <li class="number">Therefore to’s seemeth it a needful course,</li>
  <li>Before we enter his forbidden gates,</li>
  <li>To know his pleasure; and in that behalf,</li>
  <li>Bold of your worthiness, we single you</li>
  <li>As our best-moving fair solicitor.</li>
  <li class="number">Tell him, the daughter of the King of France,</li>
  <li>On serious business, craving quick dispatch,</li>
  <li>Importunes personal conference with his grace:</li>
  <li>Haste, signify so much; while we attend,</li>

  <li class="number">A man of sovereign parts he is esteem’d;</li>
  <li>Well fitted in arts, glorious in arms:</li>
  <li>Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.</li>
  <li>The only soil of his fair virtue’s gloss,</li>
  <li>If virtue’s gloss will stain with any soil,</li>
  <li class="number">Is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will;</li>
  <li>Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills</li>

  <li>Who are the rest?</li>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINE">
  <li>The young Dumain, a well-accomplished youth,</li>
  <li>Of all that virtue love for virtue loved:</li>
  <li>Most power to do most harm, least knowing ill;</li>

  <li>And shape to win grace though he had no wit.</li>
  <li>I saw him at the Duke Alencon’s once;</li>
  <li>And much too little of that good I saw</li>

  <li>I never spent an hour’s talk withal:</li>
  <li class="number">His eye begets occasion for his wit;</li>
  <li>For every object that the one doth catch</li>
  <li>The other turns to a mirth-moving jest,</li>
  <li>Which his fair tongue, conceit’s expositor,</li>
  <li>Delivers in such apt and gracious words</li>
  <li class="number">That aged ears play truant at his tales</li>
  <li>And younger hearings are quite ravished;</li>

  <li>Before I came. Marry, thus much I have learnt:</li>
  <li>He rather means to lodge you in the field,</li>

  <li>All senses to that sense did make their repair,</li>
  <li>To feel only looking on fairest of fair:</li>

  <li>I’ll give you Aquitaine and all that is his,</li>

<h3>SCENE I.  The same.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO and MOTH</div>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>Warble, child; make passionate my sense of hearing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>Concolinel.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Singing</div>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>Sweet air! Go, tenderness of years; take this key,</li>
  <li>give enlargement to the swain, bring him festinately</li>
  <li class="number">hither: I must employ him in a letter to my love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>Master, will you win your love with a French brawl?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>How meanest thou? brawling in French?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>No, my complete master: but to jig off a tune at</li>
  <li>the tongue’s end, canary to it with your feet, humour</li>
  <li class="number">it with turning up your eyelids, sigh a note and</li>
  <li>sing a note, sometime through the throat, as if you</li>
  <li>swallowed love with singing love, sometime through</li>
  <li>the nose, as if you snuffed up love by smelling</li>
  <li>love; with your hat penthouse-like o’er the shop of</li>
  <li class="number">your eyes; with your arms crossed on your thin-belly</li>
  <li>doublet like a rabbit on a spit; or your hands in</li>
  <li>your pocket like a man after the old painting; and</li>
  <li>keep not too long in one tune, but a snip and away.</li>
  <li>These are complements, these are humours; these</li>
  <li class="number">betray nice wenches, that would be betrayed without</li>
  <li>these; and make them men of note — do you note</li>
  <li>me? — that most are affected to these.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>How hast thou purchased this experience?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>By my penny of observation.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li class="number">But O — but O — </li>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>’The hobby-horse is forgot.’</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>Callest thou my love ’hobby-horse’?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>No, master; the hobby-horse is but a colt, and your</li>
  <li>love perhaps a hackney. But have you forgot your love?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li class="number">Almost I had.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>Negligent student! learn her by heart.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>By heart and in heart, boy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>And out of heart, master: all those three I will prove.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>What wilt thou prove?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li class="number">A man, if I live; and this, by, in, and without, upon</li>
  <li>the instant: by heart you love her, because your</li>
  <li>heart cannot come by her; in heart you love her,</li>
  <li>because your heart is in love with her; and out of</li>
  <li>heart you love her, being out of heart that you</li>
  <li class="number">cannot enjoy her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>I am all these three.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>And three times as much more, and yet nothing at</li>
  <li>all.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>Fetch hither the swain: he must carry me a letter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li class="number">A message well sympathized; a horse to be ambassador</li>
  <li>for an ass.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>Ha, ha! what sayest thou?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>Marry, sir, you must send the ass upon the horse,</li>
  <li>for he is very slow-gaited. But I go.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li class="number">The way is but short: away!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>As swift as lead, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>The meaning, pretty ingenious?</li>
  <li>Is not lead a metal heavy, dull, and slow?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>Minime, honest master; or rather, master, no.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li class="number">I say lead is slow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>You are too swift, sir, to say so:</li>
  <li>Is that lead slow which is fired from a gun?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>Sweet smoke of rhetoric!</li>
  <li>He reputes me a cannon; and the bullet, that’s he:</li>
  <li class="number">I shoot thee at the swain.</li>

  <li>Some enigma, some riddle: come, thy l’envoy; begin.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COSTARD">
  <li>No enigma, no riddle, no l’envoy; no salve in the</li>

  <li class="number">l’envoy, no l’envoy; no salve, sir, but a plantain!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>By virtue, thou enforcest laughter; thy silly</li>

  <li>me to ridiculous smiling. O, pardon me, my stars!</li>
  <li>Doth the inconsiderate take salve for l’envoy, and</li>
  <li class="number">the word l’envoy for a salve?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>Do the wise think them other? is not l’envoy a salve?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>No, page: it is an epilogue or discourse, to make plain</li>
  <li>Some obscure precedence that hath tofore been sain.</li>
  <li>I will example it:</li>
  <li class="number">The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,</li>
  <li>Were still at odds, being but three.</li>
  <li>There’s the moral. Now the l’envoy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>I will add the l’envoy. Say the moral again.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,</li>
  <li class="number">Were still at odds, being but three.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>Until the goose came out of door,</li>
  <li>And stay’d the odds by adding four.</li>
  <li>Now will I begin your moral, and do you follow with</li>
  <li>my l’envoy.</li>
  <li class="number">The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,</li>
  <li>Were still at odds, being but three.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>Until the goose came out of door,</li>
  <li>Staying the odds by adding four.</li>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>A good l’envoy, ending in the goose: would you</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COSTARD">
  <li>The boy hath sold him a bargain, a goose, that’s flat.</li>
  <li>Sir, your pennyworth is good, an your goose be fat.</li>
  <li>To sell a bargain well is as cunning as fast and loose:</li>
  <li>Let me see; a fat l’envoy; ay, that’s a fat goose.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li class="number">Come hither, come hither. How did this argument begin?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>By saying that a costard was broken in a shin.</li>
  <li>Then call’d you for the l’envoy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COSTARD">
  <li>True, and I for a plantain: thus came your</li>
  <li>argument in;</li>
  <li class="number">Then the boy’s fat l’envoy, the goose that you bought;</li>
  <li>And he ended the market.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>But tell me; how was there a costard broken in a shin?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>I will tell you sensibly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="COSTARD">
  <li>Thou hast no feeling of it, Moth: I will speak that l’envoy:</li>
  <li class="number">I Costard, running out, that was safely within,</li>
  <li>Fell over the threshold and broke my shin.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>We will talk no more of this matter.</li>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>By my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty,</li>

<ol data-speaker="COSTARD">
  <li class="number">True, true; and now you will be my purgation and let me loose.</li>

<h3>SCENE I.  The same.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter the PRINCESS, and her train, a Forester,
BOYET, ROSALINE, MARIA, and KATHARINE</div>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCESS">
  <li>Was that the king, that spurred his horse so hard</li>
  <li>Against the steep uprising of the hill?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOYET">
  <li>I know not; but I think it was not he.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCESS">
  <li>Whoe’er a’ was, a’ show’d a mounting mind.</li>
  <li class="number">Well, lords, to-day we shall have our dispatch:</li>
  <li>On Saturday we will return to France.</li>
  <li>Then, forester, my friend, where is the bush</li>
  <li>That we must stand and play the murderer in?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Forester">
  <li>Hereby, upon the edge of yonder coppice;</li>
  <li class="number">A stand where you may make the fairest shoot.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCESS">
  <li>I thank my beauty, I am fair that shoot,</li>
  <li>And thereupon thou speak’st the fairest shoot.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Forester">
  <li>Pardon me, madam, for I meant not so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCESS">
  <li>What, what? first praise me and again say no?</li>
  <li class="number">O short-lived pride! Not fair? alack for woe!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Forester">
  <li>Yes, madam, fair.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCESS">
  <li>Nay, never paint me now:</li>
  <li>Where fair is not, praise cannot mend the brow.</li>
  <li>Here, good my glass, take this for telling true:</li>
  <li class="number">Fair payment for foul words is more than due.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Forester">
  <li>Nothing but fair is that which you inherit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCESS">
  <li>See see, my beauty will be saved by merit!</li>
  <li>O heresy in fair, fit for these days!</li>
  <li>A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise.</li>
  <li class="number">But come, the bow: now mercy goes to kill,</li>
  <li>And shooting well is then accounted ill.</li>
  <li>Thus will I save my credit in the shoot:</li>
  <li>Not wounding, pity would not let me do’t;</li>
  <li>If wounding, then it was to show my skill,</li>
  <li class="number">That more for praise than purpose meant to kill.</li>
  <li>And out of question so it is sometimes,</li>
  <li>Glory grows guilty of detested crimes,</li>
  <li>When, for fame’s sake, for praise, an outward part,</li>
  <li>We bend to that the working of the heart;</li>
  <li class="number">As I for praise alone now seek to spill</li>
  <li>The poor deer’s blood, that my heart means no ill.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOYET">
  <li>Do not curst wives hold that self-sovereignty</li>
  <li>Only for praise sake, when they strive to be</li>
  <li>Lords o’er their lords?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCESS">
  <li class="number">Only for praise: and praise we may afford</li>
  <li>To any lady that subdues a lord.</li>

  <li>whom came he? to the beggar: what saw he? the</li>

  <li class="number">both. I am the king; for so stands the comparison:</li>

  <li>Shall I command thy love? I may: shall I enforce</li>

  <li>She passes praise; then praise too short doth blot.</li>
  <li>A wither’d hermit, five-score winters worn,</li>
  <li>Might shake off fifty, looking in her eye:</li>
  <li class="number">Beauty doth varnish age, as if new-born,</li>
  <li>And gives the crutch the cradle’s infancy:</li>
  <li>O, ’tis the sun that maketh all things shine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FERDINAND">
  <li>By heaven, thy love is black as ebony.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">
  <li>Is ebony like her? O wood divine!</li>
  <li class="number">A wife of such wood were felicity.</li>
  <li>O, who can give an oath? where is a book?</li>
  <li>That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack,</li>
  <li>If that she learn not of her eye to look:</li>
  <li>No face is fair that is not full so black.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FERDINAND">
  <li class="number">O paradox! Black is the badge of hell,</li>
  <li>The hue of dungeons and the suit of night;</li>
  <li>And beauty’s crest becomes the heavens well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">
  <li>Devils soonest tempt, resembling spirits of light.</li>
  <li>O, if in black my lady’s brows be deck’d,</li>
  <li class="number">It mourns that painting and usurping hair</li>
  <li>Should ravish doters with a false aspect;</li>
  <li>And therefore is she born to make black fair.</li>
  <li>Her favour turns the fashion of the days,</li>
  <li>For native blood is counted painting now;</li>
  <li class="number">And therefore red, that would avoid dispraise,</li>
  <li>Paints itself black, to imitate her brow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUMAIN">
  <li>To look like her are chimney-sweepers black.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LONGAVILLE">
  <li>And since her time are colliers counted bright.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FERDINAND">
  <li>And Ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUMAIN">
  <li class="number">Dark needs no candles now, for dark is light.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">
  <li>Your mistresses dare never come in rain,</li>
  <li>For fear their colours should be wash’d away.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FERDINAND">
  <li>’Twere good, yours did; for, sir, to tell you plain,</li>
  <li>I’ll find a fairer face not wash’d to-day.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">
  <li class="number">I’ll prove her fair, or talk till doomsday here.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FERDINAND">
  <li>No devil will fright thee then so much as she.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUMAIN">
  <li>I never knew man hold vile stuff so dear.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LONGAVILLE">
  <li>Look, here’s thy love: my foot and her face see.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">
  <li>O, if the streets were paved with thine eyes,</li>
  <li class="number">Her feet were much too dainty for such tread!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUMAIN">
  <li>O, vile! then, as she goes, what upward lies</li>
  <li>The street should see as she walk’d overhead.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FERDINAND">
  <li>But what of this? are we not all in love?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">
  <li>Nothing so sure; and thereby all forsworn.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FERDINAND">
  <li class="number">Then leave this chat; and, good Biron, now prove</li>
  <li>Our loving lawful, and our faith not torn.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUMAIN">
  <li>Ay, marry, there; some flattery for this evil.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LONGAVILLE">
  <li>O, some authority how to proceed;</li>
  <li>Some tricks, some quillets, how to cheat the devil.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUMAIN">
  <li class="number">Some salve for perjury.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">
  <li>’Tis more than need.</li>
  <li>Have at you, then, affection’s men at arms.</li>
  <li>Consider what you first did swear unto,</li>
  <li>To fast, to study, and to see no woman;</li>
  <li class="number">Flat treason ’gainst the kingly state of youth.</li>
  <li>Say, can you fast? your stomachs are too young;</li>
  <li>And abstinence engenders maladies.</li>
  <li>And where that you have vow’d to study, lords,</li>
  <li>In that each of you have forsworn his book,</li>
  <li class="number">Can you still dream and pore and thereon look?</li>
  <li>For when would you, my lord, or you, or you,</li>
  <li>Have found the ground of study’s excellence</li>
  <li>Without the beauty of a woman’s face?</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">From women’s eyes this doctrine I derive;
They are the ground, the books, the academes
From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire</li>
  <li>Why, universal plodding poisons up</li>
  <li class="number">The nimble spirits in the arteries,</li>
  <li>As motion and long-during action tires</li>
  <li>The sinewy vigour of the traveller.</li>
  <li>Now, for not looking on a woman’s face,</li>
  <li>You have in that forsworn the use of eyes</li>
  <li class="number">And study too, the causer of your vow;</li>
  <li>For where is any author in the world</li>
  <li>Teaches such beauty as a woman’s eye?</li>
  <li>Learning is but an adjunct to ourself</li>
  <li>And where we are our learning likewise is:</li>
  <li class="number">Then when ourselves we see in ladies’ eyes,</li>
  <li>Do we not likewise see our learning there?</li>
  <li>O, we have made a vow to study, lords,</li>
  <li>And in that vow we have forsworn our books.</li>
  <li>For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,</li>
  <li class="number">In leaden contemplation have found out</li>
  <li>Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes</li>
  <li>Of beauty’s tutors have enrich’d you with?</li>
  <li>Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;</li>
  <li>And therefore, finding barren practisers,</li>
  <li class="number">Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil:</li>
  <li>But love, first learned in a lady’s eyes,</li>
  <li>Lives not alone immured in the brain;</li>
  <li>But, with the motion of all elements,</li>
  <li>Courses as swift as thought in every power,</li>
  <li class="number">And gives to every power a double power,</li>
  <li>Above their functions and their offices.</li>
  <li>It adds a precious seeing to the eye;</li>
  <li>A lover’s eyes will gaze an eagle blind;</li>
  <li>A lover’s ear will hear the lowest sound,</li>
  <li class="number">When the suspicious head of theft is stopp’d:</li>
  <li>Love’s feeling is more soft and sensible</li>
  <li>Than are the tender horns of cockl’d snails;</li>
  <li>Love’s tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:</li>
  <li>For valour, is not Love a Hercules,</li>
  <li class="number">Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?</li>
  <li>Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical</li>
  <li>As bright Apollo’s lute, strung with his hair:</li>
  <li>And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods</li>
  <li>Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.</li>
  <li class="number">Never durst poet touch a pen to write</li>
  <li>Until his ink were temper’d with Love’s sighs;</li>
  <li>O, then his lines would ravish savage ears</li>
  <li>And plant in tyrants mild humility.</li>
  <li>From women’s eyes this doctrine I derive:</li>
  <li class="number">They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;</li>
  <li>They are the books, the arts, the academes,</li>
  <li>That show, contain and nourish all the world:</li>
  <li>Else none at all in ought proves excellent.</li>
  <li>Then fools you were these women to forswear,</li>
  <li class="number">Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.</li>
  <li>For wisdom’s sake, a word that all men love,</li>
  <li>Or for love’s sake, a word that loves all men,</li>
  <li>Or for men’s sake, the authors of these women,</li>
  <li>Or women’s sake, by whom we men are men,</li>
  <li class="number">Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,</li>
  <li>Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.</li>
  <li>It is religion to be thus forsworn,</li>
  <li>For charity itself fulfills the law,</li>
  <li>And who can sever love from charity?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FERDINAND">
  <li class="number">Saint Cupid, then! and, soldiers, to the field!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">
  <li>Advance your standards, and upon them, lords;</li>
  <li>Pell-mell, down with them! but be first advised,</li>
  <li>In conflict that you get the sun of them.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LONGAVILLE">
  <li>Now to plain-dealing; lay these glozes by:</li>
  <li class="number">Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FERDINAND">
  <li>And win them too: therefore let us devise</li>
  <li>Some entertainment for them in their tents.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">
  <li>First, from the park let us conduct them thither;</li>
  <li>Then homeward every man attach the hand</li>
  <li class="number">Of his fair mistress: in the afternoon</li>
  <li>We will with some strange pastime solace them,</li>
  <li>Such as the shortness of the time can shape;</li>
  <li>For revels, dances, masks and merry hours</li>
  <li>Forerun fair Love, strewing her way with flowers.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FERDINAND">
  <li class="number">Away, away! no time shall be omitted</li>
  <li>That will betime, and may by us be fitted.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">
  <li>Allons! allons! Sow’d cockle reap’d no corn;</li>
  <li>And justice always whirls in equal measure:</li>
  <li>Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn;</li>
  <li class="number">If so, our copper buys no better treasure.</li>

<ol data-speaker="HOLOFERNES">
  <li>Satis quod sufficit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR NATHANIEL">
  <li>I praise God for you, sir: your reasons at dinner</li>
  <li>have been sharp and sententious; pleasant without</li>
  <li>scurrility, witty without affection, audacious without</li>
  <li class="number">impudency, learned without opinion, and strange with-</li>
  <li>out heresy. I did converse this quondam day with</li>
  <li>a companion of the king’s, who is intituled, nomi-</li>
  <li>nated, or called, Don Adriano de Armado.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOLOFERNES">
  <li>Novi hominem tanquam te: his humour is lofty, his</li>
  <li class="number">discourse peremptory, his tongue filed, his eye</li>
  <li>ambitious, his gait majestical, and his general</li>
  <li>behavior vain, ridiculous, and thrasonical. He is</li>
  <li>too picked, too spruce, too affected, too odd, as it</li>
  <li>were, too peregrinate, as I may call it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR NATHANIEL">
  <li class="number">A most singular and choice epithet.</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Draws out his table-book</div>

<ol data-speaker="HOLOFERNES">
  <li>He draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer</li>

  <li>fanatical phantasimes, such insociable and</li>
  <li>point-devise companions; such rackers of</li>
  <li class="number">orthography, as to speak dout, fine, when he should</li>
  <li>say doubt; det, when he should pronounce debt — d,</li>
  <li>e, b, t, not d, e, t: he clepeth a calf, cauf;</li>
  <li>half, hauf; neighbour vocatur nebor; neigh</li>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>Sir, it is the king’s most sweet pleasure and</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOLOFERNES">
  <li>The posterior of the day, most generous sir, is</li>
  <li>liable, congruent and measurable for the afternoon:</li>
  <li>the word is well culled, chose, sweet and apt, I do</li>
  <li class="number">assure you, sir, I do assure.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>Sir, the king is a noble gentleman, and my familiar,</li>
  <li>I do assure ye, very good friend: for what is</li>
  <li>inward between us, let it pass. I do beseech thee,</li>
  <li>remember thy courtesy; I beseech thee, apparel thy</li>
  <li class="number">head: and among other important and most serious</li>
  <li>designs, and of great import indeed, too, but let</li>
  <li>that pass: for I must tell thee, it will please his</li>
  <li>grace, by the world, sometime to lean upon my poor</li>
  <li>shoulder, and with his royal finger, thus, dally</li>
  <li class="number">with my excrement, with my mustachio; but, sweet</li>
  <li>heart, let that pass. By the world, I recount no</li>
  <li>fable: some certain special honours it pleaseth his</li>
  <li>greatness to impart to Armado, a soldier, a man of</li>
  <li>travel, that hath seen the world; but let that pass.</li>
  <li class="number">The very all of all is — but, sweet heart, I do</li>
  <li>implore secrecy — that the king would have me</li>
  <li>present the princess, sweet chuck, with some</li>
  <li>delightful ostentation, or show, or pageant, or</li>
  <li>antique, or firework. Now, understanding that the</li>
  <li class="number">curate and your sweet self are good at such</li>
  <li>eruptions and sudden breaking out of mirth, as it</li>
  <li>were, I have acquainted you withal, to the end to</li>
  <li>crave your assistance.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOLOFERNES">
  <li>Sir, you shall present before her the Nine Worthies.</li>
  <li class="number">Sir, as concerning some entertainment of time, some</li>
  <li>show in the posterior of this day, to be rendered by</li>
  <li>our assistants, at the king’s command, and this most</li>
  <li>gallant, illustrate, and learned gentleman, before</li>
  <li>the princess; I say none so fit as to present the</li>
  <li class="number">Nine Worthies.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR NATHANIEL">
  <li>Where will you find men worthy enough to present them?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOLOFERNES">
  <li>Joshua, yourself; myself and this gallant gentleman,</li>
  <li>Judas Maccabaeus; this swain, because of his great</li>
  <li>limb or joint, shall pass Pompey the Great; the</li>
  <li class="number">page, Hercules — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>Pardon, sir; error: he is not quantity enough for</li>
  <li>that Worthy’s thumb: he is not so big as the end of his club.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOLOFERNES">
  <li>Shall I have audience? he shall present Hercules in</li>
  <li>minority: his enter and exit shall be strangling a</li>
  <li class="number">snake; and I will have an apology for that purpose.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>An excellent device! so, if any of the audience</li>
  <li>hiss, you may cry ’Well done, Hercules! now thou</li>
  <li>crushest the snake!’ that is the way to make an</li>
  <li>offence gracious, though few have the grace to do it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li class="number">For the rest of the Worthies? — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOLOFERNES">
  <li>I will play three myself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH">
  <li>Thrice-worthy gentleman!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li>Shall I tell you a thing?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOLOFERNES">
  <li>We attend.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO">
  <li class="number">We will have, if this fadge not, an antique. I</li>
  <li>beseech you, follow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOLOFERNES">
  <li>Via, goodman Dull! thou hast spoken no word all this while.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DULL">
  <li>Nor understood none neither, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOLOFERNES">
  <li>Allons! we will employ thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DULL">
  <li class="number">I’ll make one in a dance, or so; or I will play</li>
  <li>On the tabour to the Worthies, and let them dance the hay.</li>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCESS">
  <li>Well bandied both; a set of wit well play’d.</li>
  <li class="number">But Rosaline, you have a favour too:</li>
  <li>Who sent it? and what is it?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALINE">
  <li>I would you knew:</li>
  <li>An if my face were but as fair as yours,</li>
  <li>My favour were as great; be witness this.</li>
  <li class="number">Nay, I have verses too, I thank Biron:</li>
  <li>The numbers true; and, were the numbering too,</li>
  <li>I were the fairest goddess on the ground:</li>
  <li>I am compared to twenty thousand fairs.</li>
  <li>O, he hath drawn my picture in his letter!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCESS">
  <li class="number">Any thing like?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALINE">
  <li>Much in the letters; nothing in the praise.</li>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCESS">
  <li>Beauteous as ink; a good conclusion.</li>

  <li>’Ware pencils, ho! let me not die your debtor,</li>
  <li class="number">My red dominical, my golden letter:</li>
  <li>O, that your face were not so full of O’s!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINE">
  <li>A pox of that jest! and I beshrew all shrows.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCESS">
  <li>But, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair Dumain?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINE">
  <li>Madam, this glove.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCESS">
  <li class="number">Did he not send you twain?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINE">
  <li>Yes, madam, and moreover</li>
  <li>Some thousand verses of a faithful lover,</li>
  <li>A huge translation of hypocrisy,</li>
  <li>Vilely compiled, profound simplicity.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARIA">
  <li class="number">This and these pearls to me sent Longaville:</li>
  <li>The letter is too long by half a mile.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCESS">
  <li>I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart</li>
  <li>The chain were longer and the letter short?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARIA">
  <li>Ay, or I would these hands might never part.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCESS">
  <li class="number">We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALINE">
  <li>They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.</li>
  <li>That same Biron I’ll torture ere I go:</li>
  <li>O that I knew he were but in by the week!</li>
  <li>How I would make him fawn and beg and seek</li>
  <li class="number">And wait the season and observe the times</li>
  <li>And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes</li>
  <li>And shape his service wholly to my hests</li>
  <li>And make him proud to make me proud that jests!</li>
  <li>So perttaunt-like would I o’ersway his state</li>
  <li class="number">That he should be my fool and I his fate.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCESS">
  <li>None are so surely caught, when they are catch’d,</li>
  <li>As wit turn’d fool: folly, in wisdom hatch’d,</li>
  <li>Hath wisdom’s warrant and the help of school</li>
  <li>And wit’s own grace to grace a learned fool.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALINE">
  <li class="number">The blood of youth burns not with such excess</li>
  <li>As gravity’s revolt to wantonness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARIA">
  <li>Folly in fools bears not so strong a note</li>
  <li>As foolery in the wise, when wit doth dote;</li>
  <li>Since all the power thereof it doth apply</li>
  <li class="number">To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.</li>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCESS">
  <li>Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face.</li>

  <li>O, I am stabb’d with laughter! Where’s her grace?</li>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCESS">
  <li>Thy news Boyet?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOYET">
  <li>Prepare, madam, prepare!</li>
  <li class="number">Arm, wenches, arm! encounters mounted are</li>
  <li>Against your peace: Love doth approach disguised,</li>
  <li>Armed in arguments; you’ll be surprised:</li>
  <li>Muster your wits; stand in your own defence;</li>
  <li>Or hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCESS">
  <li class="number">Saint Denis to Saint Cupid! What are they</li>
  <li>That charge their breath against us? say, scout, say.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOYET">
  <li>Under the cool shade of a sycamore</li>
  <li>I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour;</li>
  <li>When, lo! to interrupt my purposed rest,</li>
  <li class="number">Toward that shade I might behold addrest</li>
  <li>The king and his companions: warily</li>
  <li>I stole into a neighbour thicket by,</li>
  <li>And overheard what you shall overhear,</li>
  <li>That, by and by, disguised they will be here.</li>
  <li class="number">Their herald is a pretty knavish page,</li>
  <li>That well by heart hath conn’d his embassage:</li>
  <li>Action and accent did they teach him there;</li>
  <li>’Thus must thou speak,’ and ’thus thy body bear:’</li>
  <li>And ever and anon they made a doubt</li>
  <li class="number">Presence majestical would put him out,</li>
  <li>’For,’ quoth the king, ’an angel shalt thou see;</li>
  <li>Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.’</li>
  <li>The boy replied, ’An angel is not evil;</li>
  <li>I should have fear’d her had she been a devil.’</li>
  <li class="number">With that, all laugh’d and clapp’d him on the shoulder,</li>
  <li>Making the bold wag by their praises bolder:</li>
  <li>One rubb’d his elbow thus, and fleer’d and swore</li>
  <li>A better speech was never spoke before;</li>
  <li>Another, with his finger and his thumb,</li>
  <li class="number">Cried, ’Via! we will do’t, come what will come;’</li>
  <li>The third he caper’d, and cried, ’All goes well;’</li>
  <li>The fourth turn’d on the toe, and down he fell.</li>
  <li>With that, they all did tumble on the ground,</li>
  <li>With such a zealous laughter, so profound,</li>
  <li class="number">That in this spleen ridiculous appears,</li>
  <li>To cheque their folly, passion’s solemn tears.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCESS">
  <li>But what, but what, come they to visit us?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOYET">
  <li>They do, they do: and are apparell’d thus.</li>
  <li>Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.</li>
  <li class="number">Their purpose is to parle, to court and dance;</li>
  <li>And every one his love-feat will advance</li>
  <li>Unto his several mistress, which they’ll know</li>
  <li>By favours several which they did bestow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCESS">
  <li>And will they so? the gallants shall be task’d;</li>
  <li class="number">For, ladies, we shall every one be mask’d;</li>
  <li>And not a man of them shall have the grace,</li>
  <li>Despite of suit, to see a lady’s face.</li>
  <li>Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,</li>
  <li>And then the king will court thee for his dear;</li>
  <li class="number">Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,</li>
  <li>So shall Biron take me for Rosaline.</li>
  <li>And change your favours too; so shall your loves</li>
  <li>Woo contrary, deceived by these removes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALINE">
  <li>Come on, then; wear the favours most in sight.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATHARINE">
  <li class="number">But in this changing what is your intent?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCESS">
  <li>The effect of my intent is to cross theirs:</li>
  <li>They do it but in mocking merriment;</li>
  <li>And mock for mock is only my intent.</li>
  <li>Their several counsels they unbosom shall</li>
  <li class="number">To loves mistook, and so be mock’d withal</li>
  <li>Upon the next occasion that we meet,</li>
  <li>With visages displayed, to talk and greet.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALINE">
  <li>But shall we dance, if they desire to’t?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCESS">
  <li>No, to the death, we will not move a foot;</li>
  <li class="number">Nor to their penn’d speech render we no grace,</li>
  <li>But while ’tis spoke each turn away her face.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOYET">
  <li>Why, that contempt will kill the speaker’s heart,</li>
  <li>And quite divorce his memory from his part.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCESS">
  <li>Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt</li>
  <li class="number">The rest will ne’er come in, if he be out</li>
  <li>There’s no such sport as sport by sport o’erthrown,</li>
  <li>To make theirs ours and ours none but our own:</li>
  <li>So shall we stay, mocking intended game,</li>
  <li>And they, well mock’d, depart away with shame.</li>
</ol>

  <li>If to come hither you have measured miles,</li>

  <li>How many weary steps,</li>

  <li>O vain petitioner! beg a greater matter;</li>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALINE">
  <li>Our ears vouchsafe it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FERDINAND">
  <li>But your legs should do it.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALINE">
  <li>Since you are strangers and come here by chance,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FERDINAND">
  <li class="number">Why take we hands, then?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALINE">
  <li>Only to part friends:</li>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCESS">

  <li class="number">Madam, speak true. It is not so, my lord:</li>
  <li>My lady, to the manner of the days,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">

  <li>Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.</li>

  <li class="number">Nor to the motion of a schoolboy’s tongue,</li>
  <li>Nor never come in vizard to my friend,</li>
  <li>Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper’s song!</li>
  <li>Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise,</li>
  <li>Three-piled hyperboles, spruce affectation,</li>
  <li class="number">Figures pedantical; these summer-flies</li>

  <li>Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express’d</li>
  <li class="number">In russet yeas and honest kersey noes:</li>
  <li>And, to begin, wench — so God help me, la! — </li>
  <li>My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.</li>

  <li>They have the plague, and caught it of your eyes;</li>
  <li class="number">These lords are visited; you are not free,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCESS">
  <li>No, they are free that gave these tokens to us.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">
  <li>Our states are forfeit: seek not to undo us.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALINE">
  <li>It is not so; for how can this be true,</li>
  <li class="number">That you stand forfeit, being those that sue?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">
  <li>Peace! for I will not have to do with you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALINE">
  <li>Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.</li>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCESS">
  <li>When you then were here,</li>

<ol data-speaker="FERDINAND">

<ol data-speaker="PRINCESS">
  <li>Peace, peace! forbear:</li>
  <li>Your oath once broke, you force not to forswear.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FERDINAND">
  <li>Despise me, when I break this oath of mine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCESS">
  <li>I will: and therefore keep it. Rosaline,</li>
  <li class="number">What did the Russian whisper in your ear?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALINE">
  <li>Madam, he swore that he did hold me dear</li>
  <li>As precious eyesight, and did value me</li>
  <li>Above this world; adding thereto moreover</li>
  <li>That he would wed me, or else die my lover.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCESS">
  <li class="number">God give thee joy of him! the noble lord</li>
  <li>Most honourably doth unhold his word.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FERDINAND">
  <li>What mean you, madam? by my life, my troth,</li>
  <li>I never swore this lady such an oath.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROSALINE">
  <li>By heaven, you did; and to confirm it plain,</li>
  <li class="number">You gave me this: but take it, sir, again.</li>

<ol data-speaker="FERDINAND">

  <li>And Lord Biron, I thank him, is my dear.</li>
  <li class="number">What, will you have me, or your pearl again?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BIRON">
  <li>Neither of either; I remit both twain.</li>
  <li>I see the trick on’t: here was a consent,</li>
  <li>Knowing aforehand of our merriment,</li>
  <li>To dash it like a Christmas comedy:</li>
  <li class="number">Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany,</li>
  <li>Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick,</li>
  <li>That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick</li>
  <li>To make my lady laugh when she’s disposed,</li>
  <li>Told our intents before; which once disclosed,</li>
  <li class="number">The ladies did change favours: and then we,</li>
  <li>Following the signs, woo’d but the sign of she.</li>
  <li>Now, to our perjury to add more terror,</li>
  <li>We are again forsworn, in will and error.</li>
  <li>Much upon this it is: and might not you</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">To BOYET</li>
  <li class="number">Forestall our sport, to make us thus untrue?</li>
  <li>Do not you know my lady’s foot by the squier,</li>

  <li>And stand between her back, sir, and the fire,</li>
  <li>Holding a trencher, jesting merrily?</li>
  <li class="number">You put our page out: go, you are allow’d;</li>
  <li>Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.</li>

  <li class="number">Unpleasing to a married ear!</li>
  <li>When shepherds pipe on oaten straws</li>
  <li>And merry larks are ploughmen’s clocks,</li>
  <li>When turtles tread, and rooks, and daws,</li>
  <li>And maidens bleach their summer smocks</li>
  <li class="number">The cuckoo then, on every tree,</li>
  <li>Mocks married men; for thus sings he,  Cuckoo;</li>
  <li>Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,</li>
  <li>Unpleasing to a married ear!</li>
  <li class="subhead">WINTER.</li>
  <li>When icicles hang by the wall</li>
  <li class="number">And Dick the shepherd blows his nail</li>
  <li>And Tom bears logs into the hall</li>
  <li>And milk comes frozen home in pail,</li>
  <li>When blood is nipp’d and ways be foul,</li>
  <li>Then nightly sings the staring owl,  Tu-whit;</li>
  <li class="number">Tu-who, a merry note,</li>
  <li>While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.</li>
  <li>When all aloud the wind doth blow</li>
  <li>And coughing drowns the parson’s saw</li>
  <li>And birds sit brooding in the snow</li>
  <li class="number">And Marian’s nose looks red and raw,</li>
  <li>When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,</li>
  <li>Then nightly sings the staring owl,  Tu-whit;</li>
  <li>Tu-who, a merry note,</li>
  <li>While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.</li>
