<h3>SCENE I.  An apartment in the DUKE’S palace.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter DUKE VINCENTIO, ESCALUS, Lords and
Attendants</div>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>Escalus.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ESCALUS">
  <li>My lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>Of government the properties to unfold,</li>
  <li>Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse;</li>
  <li class="number">Since I am put to know that your own science</li>
  <li>Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice</li>
  <li>My strength can give you: then no more remains,</li>
  <li>But that to your sufficiency, as your Worth is able,</li>
  <li>And let them work. The nature of our people,</li>
  <li class="number">Our city’s institutions, and the terms</li>
  <li>For common justice, you’re as pregnant in</li>
  <li>As art and practise hath enriched any</li>
  <li>That we remember. There is our commission,</li>
  <li>From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,</li>
  <li class="number">I say, bid come before us Angelo.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exit an Attendant</li>
  <li>What figure of us think you he will bear?</li>
  <li>For you must know, we have with special soul</li>
  <li>Elected him our absence to supply,</li>
  <li>Lent him our terror, dress’d him with our love,</li>
  <li class="number">And given his deputation all the organs</li>
  <li>Of our own power: what think you of it?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ESCALUS">
  <li>If any in Vienna be of worth</li>
  <li>To undergo such ample grace and honour,</li>
  <li>It is Lord Angelo.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li class="number">Look where he comes.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter ANGELO</div>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li>Always obedient to your grace’s will,</li>
  <li>I come to know your pleasure.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>Angelo,</li>
  <li>There is a kind of character in thy life,</li>
  <li class="number">That to the observer doth thy history</li>
  <li>Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings</li>
  <li>Are not thine own so proper as to waste</li>
  <li>Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.</li>
  <li>Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,</li>
  <li class="number">Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues</li>
  <li>Did not go forth of us, ’twere all alike</li>
  <li>As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch’d</li>
  <li>But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends</li>
  <li>The smallest scruple of her excellence</li>
  <li class="number">But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines</li>
  <li>Herself the glory of a creditor,</li>
  <li>Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech</li>
  <li>To one that can my part in him advertise;</li>
  <li>Hold therefore, Angelo: — </li>
  <li class="number">In our remove be thou at full ourself;</li>
  <li>Mortality and mercy in Vienna</li>
  <li>Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,</li>
  <li>Though first in question, is thy secondary.</li>
  <li>Take thy commission.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li class="number">Now, good my lord,</li>
  <li>Let there be some more test made of my metal,</li>
  <li>Before so noble and so great a figure</li>
  <li>Be stamp’d upon it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>No more evasion:</li>
  <li class="number">We have with a leaven’d and prepared choice</li>
  <li>Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours.</li>
  <li>Our haste from hence is of so quick condition</li>
  <li>That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion’d</li>
  <li>Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,</li>
  <li class="number">As time and our concernings shall importune,</li>
  <li>How it goes with us, and do look to know</li>
  <li>What doth befall you here. So, fare you well;</li>
  <li>To the hopeful execution do I leave you</li>
  <li>Of your commissions.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li class="number">Yet give leave, my lord,</li>
  <li>That we may bring you something on the way.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>My haste may not admit it;</li>
  <li>Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do</li>
  <li>With any scruple; your scope is as mine own</li>
  <li class="number">So to enforce or qualify the laws</li>
  <li>As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand:</li>
  <li>I’ll privily away. I love the people,</li>
  <li>But do not like to stage me to their eyes:</li>
  <li>Through it do well, I do not relish well</li>
  <li class="number">Their loud applause and Aves vehement;</li>
  <li>Nor do I think the man of safe discretion</li>
  <li>That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li>The heavens give safety to your purposes!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ESCALUS">
  <li>Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE">
  <li class="number">I thank you. Fare you well.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<ol data-speaker="ESCALUS">
  <li>I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave</li>
  <li>To have free speech with you; and it concerns me</li>
  <li>To look into the bottom of my place:</li>
  <li>A power I have, but of what strength and nature</li>
  <li class="number">I am not yet instructed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li>’Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,</li>
  <li>And we may soon our satisfaction have</li>
  <li>Touching that point.</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  A Street.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter LUCIO and two Gentlemen</div>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>If the duke with the other dukes come not to</li>
  <li>composition with the King of Hungary, why then all</li>
  <li>the dukes fall upon the king.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Gentleman">
  <li>Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of</li>
  <li class="number">Hungary’s!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Gentleman">
  <li>Amen.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate, that</li>
  <li>went to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scraped</li>
  <li>one out of the table.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Gentleman">
  <li class="number">’Thou shalt not steal’?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>Ay, that he razed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Gentleman">
  <li>Why, ’twas a commandment to command the captain and</li>
  <li>all the rest from their functions: they put forth</li>
  <li>to steal. There’s not a soldier of us all, that, in</li>
  <li class="number">the thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition</li>
  <li>well that prays for peace.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Gentleman">
  <li>I never heard any soldier dislike it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>I believe thee; for I think thou never wast where</li>
  <li>grace was said.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Gentleman">
  <li class="number">No? a dozen times at least.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Gentleman">
  <li>What, in metre?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>In any proportion or in any language.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Gentleman">
  <li>I think, or in any religion.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all</li>
  <li class="number">controversy: as, for example, thou thyself art a</li>
  <li>wicked villain, despite of all grace.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Gentleman">
  <li>Well, there went but a pair of shears between us.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>I grant; as there may between the lists and the</li>
  <li>velvet. Thou art the list.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Gentleman">
  <li class="number">And thou the velvet: thou art good velvet; thou’rt</li>
  <li>a three-piled piece, I warrant thee: I had as lief</li>
  <li>be a list of an English kersey as be piled, as thou</li>
  <li>art piled, for a French velvet. Do I speak</li>
  <li>feelingly now?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li class="number">I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful</li>
  <li>feeling of thy speech: I will, out of thine own</li>
  <li>confession, learn to begin thy health; but, whilst I</li>
  <li>live, forget to drink after thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Gentleman">
  <li>I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Gentleman">
  <li class="number">Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or free.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>Behold, behold. where Madam Mitigation comes! I</li>
  <li>have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Gentleman">
  <li>To what, I pray?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>Judge.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Gentleman">
  <li class="number">To three thousand dolours a year.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Gentleman">
  <li>Ay, and more.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>A French crown more.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Gentleman">
  <li>Thou art always figuring diseases in me; but thou</li>
  <li>art full of error; I am sound.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li class="number">Nay, not as one would say, healthy; but so sound as</li>
  <li>things that are hollow: thy bones are hollow;</li>
  <li>impiety has made a feast of thee.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter MISTRESS OVERDONE</div>

<ol data-speaker="First Gentleman">
  <li>How now! which of your hips has the most profound sciatica?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS OVERDONE">
  <li>Well, well; there’s one yonder arrested and carried</li>
  <li class="number">to prison was worth five thousand of you all.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Gentleman">
  <li>Who’s that, I pray thee?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS OVERDONE">
  <li>Marry, sir, that’s Claudio, Signior Claudio.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Gentleman">
  <li>Claudio to prison? ’tis not so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS OVERDONE">
  <li>Nay, but I know ’tis so: I saw him arrested, saw</li>
  <li class="number">him carried away; and, which is more, within these</li>
  <li>three days his head to be chopped off.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so.</li>
  <li>Art thou sure of this?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS OVERDONE">
  <li>I am too sure of it: and it is for getting Madam</li>
  <li class="number">Julietta with child.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>Believe me, this may be: he promised to meet me two</li>
  <li>hours since, and he was ever precise in</li>
  <li>promise-keeping.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Gentleman">
  <li>Besides, you know, it draws something near to the</li>
  <li class="number">speech we had to such a purpose.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Gentleman">
  <li>But, most of all, agreeing with the proclamation.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>Away! let’s go learn the truth of it.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt LUCIO and Gentlemen</div>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS OVERDONE">
  <li>Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what</li>
  <li>with the gallows and what with poverty, I am</li>
  <li class="number">custom-shrunk.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter POMPEY</li>
  <li>How now! what’s the news with you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POMPEY">
  <li>Yonder man is carried to prison.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS OVERDONE">
  <li>Well; what has he done?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POMPEY">
  <li>A woman.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS OVERDONE">
  <li class="number">But what’s his offence?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POMPEY">
  <li>Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS OVERDONE">
  <li>What, is there a maid with child by him?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POMPEY">
  <li>No, but there’s a woman with maid by him. You have</li>
  <li>not heard of the proclamation, have you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS OVERDONE">
  <li class="number">What proclamation, man?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POMPEY">
  <li>All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS OVERDONE">
  <li>And what shall become of those in the city?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POMPEY">
  <li>They shall stand for seed: they had gone down too,</li>
  <li>but that a wise burgher put in for them.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS OVERDONE">
  <li class="number">But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be</li>
  <li>pulled down?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POMPEY">
  <li>To the ground, mistress.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS OVERDONE">
  <li>Why, here’s a change indeed in the commonwealth!</li>
  <li>What shall become of me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POMPEY">
  <li class="number">Come; fear you not: good counsellors lack no</li>
  <li>clients: though you change your place, you need not</li>
  <li>change your trade; I’ll be your tapster still.</li>
  <li>Courage! there will be pity taken on you: you that</li>
  <li>have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you</li>
  <li class="number">will be considered.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MISTRESS OVERDONE">
  <li>What’s to do here, Thomas tapster? let’s withdraw.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POMPEY">
  <li>Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost to</li>
  <li>prison; and there’s Madam Juliet.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt</div>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter Provost, CLAUDIO, JULIET, and Officers</div>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUDIO">
  <li>Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world?</li>
  <li class="number">Bear me to prison, where I am committed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Provost">
  <li>I do it not in evil disposition,</li>
  <li>But from Lord Angelo by special charge.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUDIO">
  <li>Thus can the demigod Authority</li>
  <li>Make us pay down for our offence by weight</li>
  <li class="number">The words of heaven; on whom it will, it will;</li>
  <li>On whom it will not, so; yet still ’tis just.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Re-enter LUCIO and two Gentlemen</div>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>Why, how now, Claudio! whence comes this restraint?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUDIO">
  <li>From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty:</li>
  <li>As surfeit is the father of much fast,</li>
  <li class="number">So every scope by the immoderate use</li>
  <li>Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,</li>
  <li>Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,</li>
  <li>A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>If could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would</li>
  <li class="number">send for certain of my creditors: and yet, to say</li>
  <li>the truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedom</li>
  <li>as the morality of imprisonment. What’s thy</li>
  <li>offence, Claudio?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUDIO">
  <li>What but to speak of would offend again.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li class="number">What, is’t murder?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUDIO">
  <li>No.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>Lechery?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUDIO">
  <li>Call it so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Provost">
  <li>Away, sir! you must go.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUDIO">
  <li class="number">One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>A hundred, if they’ll do you any good.</li>
  <li>Is lechery so look’d after?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUDIO">
  <li>Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract</li>
  <li>I got possession of Julietta’s bed:</li>
  <li class="number">You know the lady; she is fast my wife,</li>
  <li>Save that we do the denunciation lack</li>
  <li>Of outward order: this we came not to,</li>
  <li>Only for propagation of a dower</li>
  <li>Remaining in the coffer of her friends,</li>
  <li class="number">From whom we thought it meet to hide our love</li>
  <li>Till time had made them for us. But it chances</li>
  <li>The stealth of our most mutual entertainment</li>
  <li>With character too gross is writ on Juliet.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>With child, perhaps?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUDIO">
  <li class="number">Unhappily, even so.</li>
  <li>And the new deputy now for the duke — </li>
  <li>Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,</li>
  <li>Or whether that the body public be</li>
  <li>A horse whereon the governor doth ride,</li>
  <li class="number">Who, newly in the seat, that it may know</li>
  <li>He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;</li>
  <li>Whether the tyranny be in his place,</li>
  <li>Or in his emmence that fills it up,</li>
  <li>I stagger in: — but this new governor</li>
  <li class="number">Awakes me all the enrolled penalties</li>
  <li>Which have, like unscour’d armour, hung by the wall</li>
  <li>So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round</li>
  <li>And none of them been worn; and, for a name,</li>
  <li>Now puts the drowsy and neglected act</li>
  <li class="number">Freshly on me: ’tis surely for a name.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>I warrant it is: and thy head stands so tickle on</li>
  <li>thy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love,</li>
  <li>may sigh it off. Send after the duke and appeal to</li>
  <li>him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUDIO">
  <li class="number">I have done so, but he’s not to be found.</li>
  <li>I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:</li>
  <li>This day my sister should the cloister enter</li>
  <li>And there receive her approbation:</li>
  <li>Acquaint her with the danger of my state:</li>
  <li class="number">Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends</li>
  <li>To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him:</li>
  <li>I have great hope in that; for in her youth</li>
  <li>There is a prone and speechless dialect,</li>
  <li>Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art</li>
  <li class="number">When she will play with reason and discourse,</li>
  <li>And well she can persuade.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>I pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the</li>
  <li>like, which else would stand under grievous</li>
  <li>imposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who I</li>
  <li class="number">would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a</li>
  <li>game of tick-tack. I’ll to her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUDIO">
  <li>I thank you, good friend Lucio.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>Within two hours.</li>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUDIO">
  <li>Come, officer, away!</li>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>No, holy father; throw away that thought;</li>
  <li>Believe not that the dribbling dart of love</li>
  <li>Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee</li>
  <li>To give me secret harbour, hath a purpose</li>
  <li class="number">More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends</li>
  <li>Of burning youth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FRIAR THOMAS">
  <li>May your grace speak of it?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>My holy sir, none better knows than you</li>
  <li>How I have ever loved the life removed</li>
  <li class="number">And held in idle price to haunt assemblies</li>
  <li>Where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps.</li>
  <li>I have deliver’d to Lord Angelo,</li>
  <li>A man of stricture and firm abstinence,</li>
  <li>My absolute power and place here in Vienna,</li>
  <li class="number">And he supposes me travell’d to Poland;</li>
  <li>For so I have strew’d it in the common ear,</li>
  <li>And so it is received. Now, pious sir,</li>

<ol data-speaker="FRIAR THOMAS">
  <li>Gladly, my lord.</li>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li class="number">We have strict statutes and most biting laws.</li>

  <li>Even like an o’ergrown lion in a cave,</li>
  <li>That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,</li>

  <li>Only to stick it in their children’s sight</li>
  <li>For terror, not to use, in time the rod</li>

  <li>Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;</li>
  <li class="number">And liberty plucks justice by the nose;</li>
  <li>The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart</li>
  <li>Goes all decorum.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FRIAR THOMAS">
  <li>It rested in your grace</li>
  <li>To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased:</li>
  <li class="number">And it in you more dreadful would have seem’d</li>
  <li>Than in Lord Angelo.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>I do fear, too dreadful:</li>
  <li>Sith ’twas my fault to give the people scope,</li>
  <li>’Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them</li>
  <li class="number">For what I bid them do: for we bid this be done,</li>
  <li>When evil deeds have their permissive pass</li>
  <li>And not the punishment. Therefore indeed, my father,</li>
  <li>I have on Angelo imposed the office;</li>
  <li>Who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home,</li>
  <li class="number">And yet my nature never in the fight</li>
  <li>To do in slander. And to behold his sway,</li>
  <li>I will, as ’twere a brother of your order,</li>
  <li>Visit both prince and people: therefore, I prithee,</li>
  <li>Supply me with the habit and instruct me</li>
  <li class="number">How I may formally in person bear me</li>
  <li>Like a true friar. More reasons for this action</li>
  <li>At our more leisure shall I render you;</li>
  <li>Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;</li>
  <li>Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses</li>
  <li class="number">That his blood flows, or that his appetite</li>
  <li>Is more to bread than stone: hence shall we see,</li>
  <li>If power change purpose, what our seemers be.</li>

<ol data-speaker="FRANCISCA">
  <li>It is a man’s voice. Gentle Isabella,</li>
  <li>Turn you the key, and know his business of him;</li>
  <li class="number">You may, I may not; you are yet unsworn.</li>
  <li>When you have vow’d, you must not speak with men</li>
  <li>But in the presence of the prioress:</li>

  <li>Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses</li>
  <li>Proclaim you are no less! Can you so stead me</li>
  <li>As bring me to the sight of Isabella,</li>
  <li class="number">A novice of this place and the fair sister</li>
  <li>To her unhappy brother Claudio?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>Why ’her unhappy brother’? let me ask,</li>
  <li>The rather for I now must make you know</li>
  <li>I am that Isabella and his sister.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li class="number">Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you:</li>
  <li>Not to be weary with you, he’s in prison.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>Woe me! for what?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>For that which, if myself might be his judge,</li>
  <li>He should receive his punishment in thanks:</li>
  <li class="number">He hath got his friend with child.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>Sir, make me not your story.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>It is true.</li>
  <li>I would not — though ’tis my familiar sin</li>
  <li>With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,</li>
  <li class="number">Tongue far from heart — play with all virgins so:</li>
  <li>I hold you as a thing ensky’d and sainted.</li>
  <li>By your renouncement an immortal spirit,</li>
  <li>And to be talk’d with in sincerity,</li>
  <li>As with a saint.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li class="number">You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, ’tis thus:</li>
  <li>Your brother and his lover have embraced:</li>
  <li>As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time</li>
  <li>That from the seedness the bare fallow brings</li>
  <li class="number">To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb</li>

  <li>Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>Is she your cousin?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>Adoptedly; as school-maids change their names</li>
  <li class="number">By vain though apt affection.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>She it is.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>O, let him marry her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>This is the point.</li>
  <li>The duke is very strangely gone from hence;</li>
  <li class="number">Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,</li>
  <li>In hand and hope of action: but we do learn</li>
  <li>By those that know the very nerves of state,</li>
  <li>His givings-out were of an infinite distance</li>
  <li>From his true-meant design. Upon his place,</li>
  <li class="number">And with full line of his authority,</li>
  <li>Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose blood</li>
  <li>Is very snow-broth; one who never feels</li>
  <li>The wanton stings and motions of the sense,</li>
  <li>But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge</li>
  <li class="number">With profits of the mind, study and fast.</li>
  <li>He — to give fear to use and liberty,</li>
  <li>Which have for long run by the hideous law,</li>
  <li>As mice by lions — hath pick’d out an act,</li>
  <li>Under whose heavy sense your brother’s life</li>
  <li class="number">Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it;</li>
  <li>And follows close the rigour of the statute,</li>
  <li>To make him an example. All hope is gone,</li>
  <li>Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer</li>
  <li>To soften Angelo: and that’s my pith of business</li>
  <li class="number">’Twixt you and your poor brother.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>Doth he so seek his life?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>Has censured him</li>
  <li>Already; and, as I hear, the provost hath</li>
  <li>A warrant for his execution.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li class="number">Alas! what poor ability’s in me</li>
  <li>To do him good?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>Assay the power you have.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>My power? Alas, I doubt — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>Our doubts are traitors</li>
  <li class="number">And make us lose the good we oft might win</li>
  <li>By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,</li>
  <li>And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,</li>
  <li>Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,</li>
  <li>All their petitions are as freely theirs</li>
  <li class="number">As they themselves would owe them.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>I’ll see what I can do.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>But speedily.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>I will about it straight;</li>
  <li>No longer staying but to give the mother</li>
  <li class="number">Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you:</li>
  <li>Commend me to my brother: soon at night</li>
  <li>I’ll send him certain word of my success.</li>

<h3>SCENE I.  A hall In ANGELO’s house.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter ANGELO, ESCALUS, and a Justice, Provost,
Officers, and other Attendants, behind</div>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li>We must not make a scarecrow of the law,</li>
  <li>Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,</li>
  <li>And let it keep one shape, till custom make it</li>
  <li>Their perch and not their terror.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ESCALUS">
  <li class="number">Ay, but yet</li>
  <li>Let us be keen, and rather cut a little,</li>
  <li>Than fall, and bruise to death. Alas, this gentleman</li>
  <li>Whom I would save, had a most noble father!</li>
  <li>Let but your honour know,</li>
  <li class="number">Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,</li>
  <li>That, in the working of your own affections,</li>
  <li>Had time cohered with place or place with wishing,</li>
  <li>Or that the resolute acting of your blood</li>
  <li>Could have attain’d the effect of your own purpose,</li>
  <li class="number">Whether you had not sometime in your life</li>
  <li>Err’d in this point which now you censure him,</li>
  <li>And pull’d the law upon you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li>’Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,</li>
  <li>Another thing to fall. I not deny,</li>
  <li class="number">The jury, passing on the prisoner’s life,</li>
  <li>May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two</li>
  <li>Guiltier than him they try. What’s open made to justice,</li>
  <li>That justice seizes: what know the laws</li>
  <li>That thieves do pass on thieves? ’Tis very pregnant,</li>
  <li class="number">The jewel that we find, we stoop and take’t</li>
  <li>Because we see it; but what we do not see</li>
  <li>We tread upon, and never think of it.</li>
  <li>You may not so extenuate his offence</li>
  <li>For I have had such faults; but rather tell me,</li>
  <li class="number">When I, that censure him, do so offend,</li>
  <li>Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,</li>
  <li>And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ESCALUS">
  <li>Be it as your wisdom will.</li>

  <li>See that Claudio</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter ELBOW, and Officers with FROTH and POMPEY</div>

<ol data-speaker="ELBOW">
  <li>Come, bring them away: if these be good people in</li>

  <li>common houses, I know no law: bring them away.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li>How now, sir! What’s your name? and what’s the matter?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ELBOW">
  <li>If it Please your honour, I am the poor duke’s</li>
  <li>constable, and my name is Elbow: I do lean upon</li>
  <li class="number">justice, sir, and do bring in here before your good</li>
  <li>honour two notorious benefactors.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li>Benefactors? Well; what benefactors are they? are</li>
  <li>they not malefactors?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ELBOW">
  <li>If it? please your honour, I know not well what they</li>
  <li class="number">are: but precise villains they are, that I am sure</li>
  <li>of; and void of all profanation in the world that</li>
  <li>good Christians ought to have.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ESCALUS">
  <li>This comes off well; here’s a wise officer.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li>Go to: what quality are they of? Elbow is your</li>
  <li class="number">name? why dost thou not speak, Elbow?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POMPEY">
  <li>He cannot, sir; he’s out at elbow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li>What are you, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ELBOW">
  <li>He, sir! a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that</li>
  <li>serves a bad woman; whose house, sir, was, as they</li>
  <li class="number">say, plucked down in the suburbs; and now she</li>
  <li>professes a hot-house, which, I think, is a very ill house too.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ESCALUS">
  <li>How know you that?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ELBOW">
  <li>My wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ESCALUS">
  <li>How? thy wife?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ELBOW">
  <li class="number">Ay, sir; whom, I thank heaven, is an honest woman — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ESCALUS">
  <li>Dost thou detest her therefore?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ELBOW">
  <li>I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as</li>
  <li>she, that this house, if it be not a bawd’s house,</li>
  <li>it is pity of her life, for it is a naughty house.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ESCALUS">
  <li class="number">How dost thou know that, constable?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ELBOW">
  <li>Marry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a woman</li>
  <li>cardinally given, might have been accused in</li>
  <li>fornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness there.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ESCALUS">
  <li>By the woman’s means?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ELBOW">
  <li class="number">Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone’s means: but as she</li>
  <li>spit in his face, so she defied him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POMPEY">
  <li>Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ELBOW">
  <li>Prove it before these varlets here, thou honourable</li>
  <li>man; prove it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ESCALUS">
  <li class="number">Do you hear how he misplaces?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POMPEY">
  <li>Sir, she came in great with child; and longing,</li>
  <li>saving your honour’s reverence, for stewed prunes;</li>
  <li>sir, we had but two in the house, which at that very</li>
  <li>distant time stood, as it were, in a fruit-dish, a</li>
  <li class="number">dish of some three-pence; your honours have seen</li>
  <li>such dishes; they are not China dishes, but very</li>
  <li>good dishes — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ESCALUS">
  <li>Go to, go to: no matter for the dish, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POMPEY">
  <li>No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in</li>
  <li class="number">the right: but to the point. As I say, this</li>
  <li>Mistress Elbow, being, as I say, with child, and</li>
  <li>being great-bellied, and longing, as I said, for</li>
  <li>prunes; and having but two in the dish, as I said,</li>
  <li>Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten the</li>
  <li class="number">rest, as I said, and, as I say, paying for them very</li>
  <li>honestly; for, as you know, Master Froth, I could</li>
  <li>not give you three-pence again.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FROTH">
  <li>No, indeed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POMPEY">
  <li>Very well: you being then, if you be remembered,</li>
  <li class="number">cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FROTH">
  <li>Ay, so I did indeed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POMPEY">
  <li>Why, very well; I telling you then, if you be</li>
  <li>remembered, that such a one and such a one were past</li>
  <li>cure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept very</li>
  <li class="number">good diet, as I told you — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FROTH">
  <li>All this is true.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POMPEY">
  <li>Why, very well, then — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ESCALUS">
  <li>Come, you are a tedious fool: to the purpose. What</li>
  <li>was done to Elbow’s wife, that he hath cause to</li>
  <li class="number">complain of? Come me to what was done to her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POMPEY">
  <li>Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ESCALUS">
  <li>No, sir, nor I mean it not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POMPEY">
  <li>Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honour’s</li>
  <li>leave. And, I beseech you, look into Master Froth</li>
  <li class="number">here, sir; a man of four-score pound a year; whose</li>
  <li>father died at Hallowmas: was’t not at Hallowmas,</li>
  <li>Master Froth?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FROTH">
  <li>All-hallond eve.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POMPEY">
  <li>Why, very well; I hope here be truths. He, sir,</li>
  <li class="number">sitting, as I say, in a lower chair, sir; ’twas in</li>
  <li>the Bunch of Grapes, where indeed you have a delight</li>
  <li>to sit, have you not?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FROTH">
  <li>I have so; because it is an open room and good for winter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POMPEY">
  <li>Why, very well, then; I hope here be truths.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li class="number">This will last out a night in Russia,</li>
  <li>When nights are longest there: I’ll take my leave.</li>
  <li>And leave you to the hearing of the cause;</li>
  <li>Hoping you’ll find good cause to whip them all.</li>

  <li>I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exit ANGELO</li>
  <li class="number">Now, sir, come on: what was done to Elbow’s wife, once more?</li>

<ol data-speaker="ELBOW">
  <li>I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ESCALUS">
  <li>Well, sir; what did this gentleman to her?</li>

<ol data-speaker="POMPEY">
  <li class="number">I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman’s face.</li>
  <li>Good Master Froth, look upon his honour; ’tis for a</li>

<ol data-speaker="ESCALUS">
  <li>Ay, sir, very well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POMPEY">
  <li>Nay; I beseech you, mark it well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ESCALUS">
  <li class="number">Well, I do so.</li>

<ol data-speaker="POMPEY">
  <li>Doth your honour see any harm in his face?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ESCALUS">
  <li>Why, no.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POMPEY">
  <li>I’ll be supposed upon a book, his face is the worst</li>
  <li>thing about him. Good, then; if his face be the</li>

  <li>constable’s wife any harm? I would know that of</li>
  <li>your honour.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ESCALUS">
  <li>He’s in the right. Constable, what say you to it?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ELBOW">
  <li>First, an it like you, the house is a respected</li>
  <li class="number">house; next, this is a respected fellow; and his</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POMPEY">
  <li>By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected</li>
  <li>person than any of us all.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ELBOW">
  <li>Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! the</li>

<ol data-speaker="ELBOW">

  <li>So. What trade are you of, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POMPHEY">
  <li>Tapster; a poor widow’s tapster.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ESCALUS">
  <li>Your mistress’ name?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POMPHEY">
  <li>Mistress Overdone.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ESCALUS">
  <li class="number">Hath she had any more than one husband?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POMPEY">
  <li>Nine, sir; Overdone by the last.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ESCALUS">
  <li>Nine! Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master</li>
  <li>Froth, I would not have you acquainted with</li>
  <li>tapsters: they will draw you, Master Froth, and you</li>
  <li class="number">will hang them. Get you gone, and let me hear no</li>
  <li>more of you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FROTH">
  <li>I thank your worship. For mine own part, I never</li>
  <li>come into any room in a tap-house, but I am drawn</li>
  <li>in.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ESCALUS">
  <li class="number">Well, no more of it, Master Froth: farewell.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exit FROTH</li>
  <li>Come you hither to me, Master tapster. What’s your</li>
  <li>name, Master tapster?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POMPEY">
  <li>Pompey.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ESCALUS">
  <li>What else?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POMPEY">
  <li class="number">Bum, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ESCALUS">
  <li>Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you;</li>
  <li>so that in the beastliest sense you are Pompey the</li>
  <li>Great. Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey,</li>
  <li>howsoever you colour it in being a tapster, are you</li>
  <li class="number">not? come, tell me true: it shall be the better for you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POMPEY">
  <li>Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ESCALUS">
  <li>How would you live, Pompey? by being a bawd? What</li>
  <li>do you think of the trade, Pompey? is it a lawful trade?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POMPEY">
  <li>If the law would allow it, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ESCALUS">
  <li class="number">But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall</li>
  <li>not be allowed in Vienna.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POMPEY">
  <li>Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the</li>
  <li>youth of the city?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ESCALUS">
  <li>No, Pompey.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POMPEY">
  <li class="number">Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to’t then.</li>
  <li>If your worship will take order for the drabs and</li>
  <li>the knaves, you need not to fear the bawds.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ESCALUS">
  <li>There are pretty orders beginning, I can tell you:</li>
  <li>it is but heading and hanging.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POMPEY">
  <li class="number">If you head and hang all that offend that way but</li>
  <li>for ten year together, you’ll be glad to give out a</li>
  <li>commission for more heads: if this law hold in</li>
  <li>Vienna ten year, I’ll rent the fairest house in it</li>
  <li>after three-pence a bay: if you live to see this</li>
  <li class="number">come to pass, say Pompey told you so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ESCALUS">
  <li>Thank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of your</li>
  <li>prophecy, hark you: I advise you, let me not find</li>
  <li>you before me again upon any complaint whatsoever;</li>
  <li>no, not for dwelling where you do: if I do, Pompey,</li>
  <li class="number">I shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd</li>
  <li>Caesar to you; in plain dealing, Pompey, I shall</li>
  <li>have you whipt: so, for this time, Pompey, fare you well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POMPEY">
  <li>I thank your worship for your good counsel:</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Aside</li>
  <li>but I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall</li>
  <li class="number">better determine.</li>
  <li>Whip me? No, no; let carman whip his jade:</li>

<ol data-speaker="ELBOW">
  <li class="number">Seven year and a half, sir.</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ELBOW">
  <li>Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters: as they</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Provost">
  <li>I would do more than that, if more were needful.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter JULIET</li>
  <li class="number">Look, here comes one: a gentlewoman of mine,</li>
  <li>Who, falling in the flaws of her own youth,</li>

  <li>When must he die?</li>

<ol data-speaker="Provost">
  <li>As I do think, to-morrow.</li>
  <li>I have provided for you: stay awhile,</li>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li class="number">Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?</li>

<ol data-speaker="JULIET">
  <li>I do; and bear the shame most patiently.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>I’ll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,</li>

<ol data-speaker="JULIET">
  <li class="number">I’ll gladly learn.</li>

  <li>Yes, as I love the woman that wrong’d him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>So then it seems your most offenceful act</li>
  <li>Was mutually committed?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JULIET">
  <li class="number">Mutually.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.</li>

  <li>I do confess it, and repent it, father.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>’Tis meet so, daughter: but lest you do repent,</li>
  <li>As that the sin hath brought you to this shame,</li>

  <li>Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,</li>
  <li>But as we stand in fear — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JULIET">
  <li>I do repent me, as it is an evil,</li>

<h3>SCENE IV.  A room in ANGELO’s house.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter ANGELO</div>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li>When I would pray and think, I think and pray</li>
  <li>To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words;</li>
  <li>Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,</li>
  <li>Anchors on Isabel: Heaven in my mouth,</li>
  <li class="number">As if I did but only chew his name;</li>
  <li>And in my heart the strong and swelling evil</li>
  <li>Of my conception. The state, whereon I studied</li>
  <li>Is like a good thing, being often read,</li>
  <li>Grown fear’d and tedious; yea, my gravity,</li>
  <li class="number">Wherein — let no man hear me — I take pride,</li>
  <li>Could I with boot change for an idle plume,</li>
  <li>Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,</li>
  <li>How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,</li>
  <li>Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls</li>
  <li class="number">To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood:</li>
  <li>Let’s write good angel on the devil’s horn:</li>
  <li>’Tis not the devil’s crest.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter a Servant</li>
  <li>How now! who’s there?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Servant">
  <li>One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li class="number">Teach her the way.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exit Servant</li>
  <li>O heavens!</li>
  <li>Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,</li>
  <li>Making both it unable for itself,</li>
  <li>And dispossessing all my other parts</li>
  <li class="number">Of necessary fitness?</li>
  <li>So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;</li>
  <li>Come all to help him, and so stop the air</li>
  <li>By which he should revive: and even so</li>
  <li>The general, subject to a well-wish’d king,</li>
  <li class="number">Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondness</li>
  <li>Crowd to his presence, where their untaught love</li>
  <li>Must needs appear offence.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter ISABELLA</li>
  <li>How now, fair maid?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>I am come to know your pleasure.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li class="number">That you might know it, would much better please me</li>
  <li>Than to demand what ’tis. Your brother cannot live.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>Even so. Heaven keep your honour!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li>Yet may he live awhile; and, it may be,</li>
  <li>As long as you or I yet he must die.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li class="number">Under your sentence?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li>Yea.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>When, I beseech you? that in his reprieve,</li>
  <li>Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted</li>
  <li>That his soul sicken not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li class="number">Ha! fie, these filthy vices! It were as good</li>
  <li>To pardon him that hath from nature stolen</li>
  <li>A man already made, as to remit</li>
  <li>Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven’s image</li>
  <li>In stamps that are forbid: ’tis all as easy</li>
  <li class="number">Falsely to take away a life true made</li>
  <li>As to put metal in restrained means</li>
  <li>To make a false one.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>’Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li>Say you so? then I shall pose you quickly.</li>
  <li class="number">Which had you rather, that the most just law</li>
  <li>Now took your brother’s life; or, to redeem him,</li>
  <li>Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness</li>
  <li>As she that he hath stain’d?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>Sir, believe this,</li>
  <li class="number">I had rather give my body than my soul.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li>I talk not of your soul: our compell’d sins</li>
  <li>Stand more for number than for accompt.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>How say you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li>Nay, I’ll not warrant that; for I can speak</li>
  <li class="number">Against the thing I say. Answer to this:</li>
  <li>I, now the voice of the recorded law,</li>
  <li>Pronounce a sentence on your brother’s life:</li>
  <li>Might there not be a charity in sin</li>
  <li>To save this brother’s life?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li class="number">Please you to do’t,</li>
  <li>I’ll take it as a peril to my soul,</li>
  <li>It is no sin at all, but charity.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li>Pleased you to do’t at peril of your soul,</li>
  <li>Were equal poise of sin and charity.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li class="number">That I do beg his life, if it be sin,</li>
  <li>Heaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit,</li>
  <li>If that be sin, I’ll make it my morn prayer</li>
  <li>To have it added to the faults of mine,</li>
  <li>And nothing of your answer.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li class="number">Nay, but hear me.</li>
  <li>Your sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant,</li>
  <li>Or seem so craftily; and that’s not good.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good,</li>
  <li>But graciously to know I am no better.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li class="number">Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright</li>
  <li>When it doth tax itself; as these black masks</li>
  <li>Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder</li>
  <li>Than beauty could, display’d. But mark me;</li>
  <li>To be received plain, I’ll speak more gross:</li>
  <li class="number">Your brother is to die.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>So.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li>And his offence is so, as it appears,</li>
  <li>Accountant to the law upon that pain.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>True.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li class="number">Admit no other way to save his life — </li>
  <li>As I subscribe not that, nor any other,</li>
  <li>But in the loss of question — that you, his sister,</li>
  <li>Finding yourself desired of such a person,</li>
  <li>Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,</li>
  <li class="number">Could fetch your brother from the manacles</li>
  <li>Of the all-building law; and that there were</li>
  <li>No earthly mean to save him, but that either</li>
  <li>You must lay down the treasures of your body</li>
  <li>To this supposed, or else to let him suffer;</li>
  <li class="number">What would you do?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>As much for my poor brother as myself:</li>
  <li>That is, were I under the terms of death,</li>
  <li>The impression of keen whips I’ld wear as rubies,</li>
  <li>And strip myself to death, as to a bed</li>
  <li class="number">That longing have been sick for, ere I’ld yield</li>
  <li>My body up to shame.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li>Then must your brother die.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>And ’twere the cheaper way:</li>
  <li>Better it were a brother died at once,</li>
  <li class="number">Than that a sister, by redeeming him,</li>
  <li>Should die for ever.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li>Were not you then as cruel as the sentence</li>
  <li>That you have slander’d so?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>Ignomy in ransom and free pardon</li>
  <li class="number">Are of two houses: lawful mercy</li>
  <li>Is nothing kin to foul redemption.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li>You seem’d of late to make the law a tyrant;</li>
  <li>And rather proved the sliding of your brother</li>
  <li>A merriment than a vice.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li class="number">O, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out,</li>
  <li>To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:</li>
  <li>I something do excuse the thing I hate,</li>
  <li>For his advantage that I dearly love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li>We are all frail.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li class="number">Else let my brother die,</li>
  <li>If not a feodary, but only he</li>
  <li>Owe and succeed thy weakness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li>Nay, women are frail too.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves;</li>
  <li class="number">Which are as easy broke as they make forms.</li>
  <li>Women! Help Heaven! men their creation mar</li>
  <li>In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail;</li>
  <li>For we are soft as our complexions are,</li>
  <li>And credulous to false prints.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li class="number">I think it well:</li>
  <li>And from this testimony of your own sex — </li>
  <li>Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger</li>
  <li>Than faults may shake our frames — let me be bold;</li>
  <li>I do arrest your words. Be that you are,</li>
  <li class="number">That is, a woman; if you be more, you’re none;</li>
  <li>If you be one, as you are well express’d</li>
  <li>By all external warrants, show it now,</li>
  <li>By putting on the destined livery.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>I have no tongue but one: gentle my lord,</li>
  <li class="number">Let me entreat you speak the former language.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li>Plainly conceive, I love you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>My brother did love Juliet,</li>
  <li>And you tell me that he shall die for it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li>He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li class="number">I know your virtue hath a licence in’t,</li>
  <li>Which seems a little fouler than it is,</li>
  <li>To pluck on others.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li>Believe me, on mine honour,</li>
  <li>My words express my purpose.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li class="number">Ha! little honour to be much believed,</li>
  <li>And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!</li>
  <li>I will proclaim thee, Angelo; look for’t:</li>
  <li>Sign me a present pardon for my brother,</li>
  <li>Or with an outstretch’d throat I’ll tell the world aloud</li>
  <li class="number">What man thou art.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li>Who will believe thee, Isabel?</li>
  <li>My unsoil’d name, the austereness of my life,</li>
  <li>My vouch against you, and my place i’ the state,</li>
  <li>Will so your accusation overweigh,</li>
  <li class="number">That you shall stifle in your own report</li>
  <li>And smell of calumny. I have begun,</li>
  <li>And now I give my sensual race the rein:</li>
  <li>Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;</li>
  <li>Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,</li>
  <li class="number">That banish what they sue for; redeem thy brother</li>
  <li>By yielding up thy body to my will;</li>
  <li>Or else he must not only die the death,</li>
  <li>But thy unkindness shall his death draw out</li>
  <li>To lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,</li>
  <li class="number">Or, by the affection that now guides me most,</li>
  <li>I’ll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,</li>
  <li>Say what you can, my false o’erweighs your true.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

  <li>So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUDIO">

  <li>I’ve hope to live, and am prepared to die.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li class="number">Be absolute for death; either death or life</li>
  <li>Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:</li>
  <li>If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing</li>
  <li>That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,</li>
  <li>Servile to all the skyey influences,</li>
  <li class="number">That dost this habitation, where thou keep’st,</li>
  <li>Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death’s fool;</li>
  <li>For him thou labour’st by thy flight to shun</li>
  <li>And yet runn’st toward him still. Thou art not noble;</li>
  <li>For all the accommodations that thou bear’st</li>
  <li class="number">Are nursed by baseness. Thou’rt by no means valiant;</li>
  <li>For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork</li>
  <li>Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,</li>
  <li>And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear’st</li>
  <li>Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;</li>
  <li class="number">For thou exist’st on many a thousand grains</li>
  <li>That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;</li>
  <li>For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,</li>
  <li>And what thou hast, forget’st. Thou art not certain;</li>
  <li>For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,</li>
  <li class="number">After the moon. If thou art rich, thou’rt poor;</li>
  <li>For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,</li>
  <li>Thou bear’s thy heavy riches but a journey,</li>
  <li>And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;</li>
  <li>For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,</li>
  <li class="number">The mere effusion of thy proper loins,</li>
  <li>Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,</li>
  <li>For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,</li>
  <li>But, as it were, an after-dinner’s sleep,</li>
  <li>Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth</li>
  <li class="number">Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms</li>
  <li>Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,</li>
  <li>Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,</li>
  <li>To make thy riches pleasant. What’s yet in this</li>
  <li>That bears the name of life? Yet in this life</li>

  <li>And six or seven winters more respect</li>
  <li>Than a perpetual honour. Darest thou die?</li>
  <li>The sense of death is most in apprehension;</li>
  <li>And the poor beetle, that we tread upon,</li>
  <li class="number">In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great</li>
  <li>As when a giant dies.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUDIO">
  <li>Why give you me this shame?</li>
  <li>Think you I can a resolution fetch</li>

  <li>And hug it in mine arms.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>There spake my brother; there my father’s grave</li>
  <li>Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:</li>
  <li>Thou art too noble to conserve a life</li>
  <li class="number">In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,</li>
  <li>Whose settled visage and deliberate word</li>
  <li>Nips youth i’ the head and follies doth emmew</li>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>O, ’tis the cunning livery of hell,</li>
  <li>The damned’st body to invest and cover</li>
  <li>In prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio?</li>
  <li class="number">If I would yield him my virginity,</li>

  <li>O heavens! it cannot be.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>Yes, he would give’t thee, from this rank offence,</li>

  <li>O, were it but my life,</li>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUDIO">
  <li>Thanks, dear Isabel.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUDIO">
  <li>Yes. Has he affections in him,</li>
  <li>That thus can make him bite the law by the nose,</li>
  <li class="number">When he would force it? Sure, it is no sin,</li>
  <li>Or of the deadly seven, it is the least.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>Which is the least?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUDIO">
  <li>If it were damnable, he being so wise,</li>

  <li>What says my brother?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUDIO">
  <li>Death is a fearful thing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>And shamed life a hateful.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUDIO">
  <li>Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;</li>
  <li class="number">To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;</li>
  <li>This sensible warm motion to become</li>
  <li>A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit</li>
  <li>To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside</li>
  <li>In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;</li>
  <li class="number">To be imprison’d in the viewless winds,</li>

  <li>The pendent world; or to be worse than worst</li>

  <li>Imagine howling: ’tis too horrible!</li>
  <li class="number">The weariest and most loathed worldly life</li>
  <li>That age, ache, penury and imprisonment</li>

  <li>Alas, alas!</li>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUDIO">
  <li class="number">Sweet sister, let me live:</li>
  <li>What sin you do to save a brother’s life,</li>
  <li>Nature dispenses with the deed so far</li>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>O you beast!</li>
  <li class="number">O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!</li>
  <li>Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?</li>
  <li>Is’t not a kind of incest, to take life</li>
  <li>From thine own sister’s shame? What should I think?</li>
  <li>Heaven shield my mother play’d my father fair!</li>
  <li class="number">For such a warped slip of wilderness</li>
  <li>Ne’er issued from his blood. Take my defiance!</li>
  <li>Die, perish! Might but my bending down</li>
  <li>Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:</li>
  <li>I’ll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,</li>

  <li>Nay, hear me, Isabel.</li>

  <li>Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>What is your will?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by and</li>
  <li class="number">by have some speech with you: the satisfaction I</li>
  <li>would require is likewise your own benefit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>I have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be</li>
  <li>stolen out of other affairs; but I will attend you awhile.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Walks apart</div>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>Son, I have overheard what hath passed between you</li>
  <li class="number">and your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to</li>
  <li>corrupt her; only he hath made an essay of her</li>
  <li>virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition</li>
  <li>of natures: she, having the truth of honour in her,</li>
  <li>hath made him that gracious denial which he is most</li>
  <li class="number">glad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I</li>
  <li>know this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to</li>
  <li>death: do not satisfy your resolution with hopes</li>
  <li>that are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go to</li>
  <li>your knees and make ready.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUDIO">
  <li class="number">Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love</li>
  <li>with life that I will sue to be rid of it.</li>

  <li class="stage-direction">Exit CLAUDIO</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Re-enter Provost</div>

<ol data-speaker="Provost">
  <li>What’s your will, father</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li class="number">That now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me</li>
  <li>awhile with the maid: my mind promises with my</li>
  <li>habit no loss shall touch her by my company.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Provost">
  <li>In good time.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit Provost. ISABELLA comes forward</div>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good:</li>
  <li class="number">the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty</li>
  <li>brief in goodness; but grace, being the soul of</li>
  <li>your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever</li>
  <li>fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you,</li>
  <li>fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, but</li>
  <li class="number">that frailty hath examples for his falling, I should</li>
  <li>wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this</li>
  <li>substitute, and to save your brother?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>I am now going to resolve him: I had rather my</li>
  <li>brother die by the law than my son should be</li>
  <li class="number">unlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good duke</li>
  <li>deceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I can</li>
  <li>speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or</li>
  <li>discover his government.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>That shall not be much amiss: Yet, as the matter</li>
  <li class="number">now stands, he will avoid your accusation; he made</li>
  <li>trial of you only. Therefore fasten your ear on my</li>
  <li>advisings: to the love I have in doing good a</li>
  <li>remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe</li>
  <li>that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged</li>
  <li class="number">lady a merited benefit; redeem your brother from</li>
  <li>the angry law; do no stain to your own gracious</li>
  <li>person; and much please the absent duke, if</li>
  <li>peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of</li>
  <li>this business.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li class="number">Let me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do</li>
  <li>anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have</li>
  <li>you not heard speak of Mariana, the sister of</li>
  <li>Frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li class="number">I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>She should this Angelo have married; was affianced</li>
  <li>to her by oath, and the nuptial appointed: between</li>
  <li>which time of the contract and limit of the</li>
  <li>solemnity, her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea,</li>
  <li class="number">having in that perished vessel the dowry of his</li>
  <li>sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the</li>
  <li>poor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and</li>
  <li>renowned brother, in his love toward her ever most</li>
  <li>kind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew of</li>
  <li class="number">her fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her</li>
  <li>combinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>Can this be so? did Angelo so leave her?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them</li>
  <li>with his comfort; swallowed his vows whole,</li>
  <li class="number">pretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few,</li>
  <li>bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yet</li>
  <li>wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears,</li>
  <li>is washed with them, but relents not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid</li>
  <li class="number">from the world! What corruption in this life, that</li>
  <li>it will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>It is a rupture that you may easily heal: and the</li>
  <li>cure of it not only saves your brother, but keeps</li>
  <li>you from dishonour in doing it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li class="number">Show me how, good father.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance</li>
  <li>of her first affection: his unjust unkindness, that</li>
  <li>in all reason should have quenched her love, hath,</li>
  <li>like an impediment in the current, made it more</li>
  <li class="number">violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his</li>
  <li>requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with</li>
  <li>his demands to the point; only refer yourself to</li>
  <li>this advantage, first, that your stay with him may</li>
  <li>not be long; that the time may have all shadow and</li>
  <li class="number">silence in it; and the place answer to convenience.</li>
  <li>This being granted in course — and now follows</li>
  <li>all — we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up</li>
  <li>your appointment, go in your place; if the encounter</li>
  <li>acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to</li>
  <li class="number">her recompense: and here, by this, is your brother</li>
  <li>saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana</li>
  <li>advantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid</li>
  <li>will I frame and make fit for his attempt. If you</li>
  <li>think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness</li>
  <li class="number">of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof.</li>
  <li>What think you of it?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>The image of it gives me content already; and I</li>
  <li>trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily</li>
  <li class="number">to Angelo: if for this night he entreat you to his</li>
  <li>bed, give him promise of satisfaction. I will</li>
  <li>presently to Saint Luke’s: there, at the moated</li>
  <li>grange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that</li>
  <li>place call upon me; and dispatch with Angelo, that</li>
  <li class="number">it may be quickly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ELBOW">
  <li>Nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POMPEY">
  <li class="number">’Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the</li>
  <li>merriest was put down, and the worser allowed by</li>
  <li>order of law a furred gown to keep him warm; and</li>
  <li>furred with fox and lamb-skins too, to signify, that</li>
  <li>craft, being richer than innocency, stands for the facing.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ELBOW">
  <li class="number">Come your way, sir. ’Bless you, good father friar.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>And you, good brother father. What offence hath</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ELBOW">
  <li>Marry, sir, he hath offended the law: and, sir, we</li>
  <li>take him to be a thief too, sir; for we have found</li>
  <li class="number">upon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we have</li>
  <li>sent to the deputy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>Fie, sirrah! a bawd, a wicked bawd!</li>
  <li>The evil that thou causest to be done,</li>
  <li>That is thy means to live. Do thou but think</li>
  <li class="number">What ’tis to cram a maw or clothe a back</li>
  <li>From such a filthy vice: say to thyself,</li>
  <li>From their abominable and beastly touches</li>
  <li>I drink, I eat, array myself, and live.</li>
  <li>Canst thou believe thy living is a life,</li>
  <li class="number">So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POMPEY">
  <li>Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir; but yet,</li>
  <li>sir, I would prove — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,</li>
  <li>Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer:</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ELBOW">
  <li>He must before the deputy, sir; he has given him</li>
  <li>warning: the deputy cannot abide a whoremaster: if</li>

  <li class="number">as good go a mile on his errand.</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter LUCIO</div>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>How now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels of</li>
  <li>Caesar? art thou led in triumph? What, is there</li>
  <li>none of Pygmalion’s images, newly made woman, to be</li>
  <li>had now, for putting the hand in the pocket and</li>
  <li class="number">extracting it clutch’d? What reply, ha? What</li>
  <li>sayest thou to this tune, matter and method? Is’t</li>
  <li>not drowned i’ the last rain, ha? What sayest</li>
  <li>thou, Trot? Is the world as it was, man? Which is</li>
  <li>the way? Is it sad, and few words? or how? The</li>
  <li class="number">trick of it?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>Still thus, and thus; still worse!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she</li>
  <li>still, ha?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POMPEY">
  <li>Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she</li>
  <li class="number">is herself in the tub.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>Why, ’tis good; it is the right of it; it must be</li>
  <li>so: ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd:</li>
  <li>an unshunned consequence; it must be so. Art going</li>
  <li>to prison, Pompey?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POMPEY">
  <li class="number">Yes, faith, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>Why, ’tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell: go, say I</li>
  <li>sent thee thither. For debt, Pompey? or how?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ELBOW">
  <li>For being a bawd, for being a bawd.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>Well, then, imprison him: if imprisonment be the</li>
  <li class="number">due of a bawd, why, ’tis his right: bawd is he</li>
  <li>doubtless, and of antiquity too; bawd-born.</li>
  <li>Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to the prison,</li>
  <li>Pompey: you will turn good husband now, Pompey; you</li>
  <li>will keep the house.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POMPEY">
  <li class="number">I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear.</li>
  <li>I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage: If</li>
  <li>you take it not patiently, why, your mettle is the</li>
  <li>more. Adieu, trusty Pompey. ’Bless you, friar.</li>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>Then, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad, friar?</li>
  <li class="number">what news?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ELBOW">
  <li>Come your ways, sir; come.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>Go to kennel, Pompey; go.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exeunt ELBOW, POMPEY and Officers</li>
  <li>What news, friar, of the duke?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>I know none. Can you tell me of any?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li class="number">Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other</li>
  <li>some, he is in Rome: but where is he, think you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from</li>
  <li>the state, and usurp the beggary he was never born</li>
  <li class="number">to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; he</li>
  <li>puts transgression to ’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>He does well in ’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in</li>
  <li>him: something too crabbed that way, friar.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li class="number">It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred;</li>
  <li>it is well allied: but it is impossible to extirp</li>
  <li>it quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put</li>
  <li>down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and</li>
  <li class="number">woman after this downright way of creation: is it</li>
  <li>true, think you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>How should he be made, then?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>Some report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that he</li>
  <li>was begot between two stock-fishes. But it is</li>
  <li class="number">certain that when he makes water his urine is</li>
  <li>congealed ice; that I know to be true: and he is a</li>
  <li>motion generative; that’s infallible.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the</li>
  <li class="number">rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a</li>
  <li>man! Would the duke that is absent have done this?</li>
  <li>Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a</li>
  <li>hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing</li>
  <li>a thousand: he had some feeling of the sport: he</li>
  <li class="number">knew the service, and that instructed him to mercy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>I never heard the absent duke much detected for</li>
  <li>women; he was not inclined that way.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>O, sir, you are deceived.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>’Tis not possible.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li class="number">Who, not the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty; and</li>
  <li>his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish: the</li>
  <li>duke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too;</li>
  <li>that let me inform you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>You do him wrong, surely.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li class="number">Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the</li>
  <li>duke: and I believe I know the cause of his</li>
  <li>withdrawing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>What, I prithee, might be the cause?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>No, pardon; ’tis a secret must be locked within the</li>
  <li class="number">teeth and the lips: but this I can let you</li>
  <li>understand, the greater file of the subject held the</li>
  <li>duke to be wise.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>Wise! why, no question but he was.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li class="number">Either this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking:</li>
  <li>the very stream of his life and the business he hath</li>
  <li>helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better</li>

  <li>Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would</li>
  <li class="number">the duke we talk of were returned again: the</li>

  <li>continency; sparrows must not build in his</li>

  <li>yet would have dark deeds darkly answered; he would</li>
  <li class="number">never bring them to light: would he were returned!</li>
  <li>Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing.</li>
  <li>Farewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for me. The</li>
  <li>duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on</li>
  <li>Fridays. He’s not past it yet, and I say to thee,</li>

  <li class="number"><span class="stage-direction">Aside</span>  This is his pardon, purchased by such sin</li>
  <li>For which the pardoner himself is in.</li>
  <li>Hence hath offence his quick celerity,</li>

  <li>When vice makes mercy, mercy’s so extended,</li>
  <li class="number">That for the fault’s love is the offender friended.</li>
  <li>Now, sir, what news?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Provost">
  <li>I told you. Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss</li>
  <li>in mine office, awakens me with this unwonted</li>
  <li>putting-on; methinks strangely, for he hath not used it before.</li>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li class="number">Pray you, let’s hear.</li>

<ol data-speaker="Provost">
  <li><span class="stage-direction">Reads</span></li>
  <li>’Whatsoever you may hear to the contrary, let</li>
  <li>Claudio be executed by four of the clock; and in the</li>
  <li>afternoon Barnardine: for my better satisfaction,</li>
  <li class="number">let me have Claudio’s head sent me by five. Let</li>
  <li>this be duly performed; with a thought that more</li>
  <li>depends on it than we must yet deliver. Thus fail</li>
  <li>not to do your office, as you will answer it at your peril.’</li>
  <li>What say you to this, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li class="number">What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in the</li>
  <li>afternoon?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Provost">
  <li>A Bohemian born, but here nursed un and bred; one</li>
  <li>that is a prisoner nine years old.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>How came it that the absent duke had not either</li>
  <li class="number">delivered him to his liberty or executed him? I</li>
  <li>have heard it was ever his manner to do so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Provost">
  <li>His friends still wrought reprieves for him: and,</li>
  <li>indeed, his fact, till now in the government of Lord</li>
  <li>Angelo, came not to an undoubtful proof.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li class="number">It is now apparent?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Provost">
  <li>Most manifest, and not denied by himself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>Hath he born himself penitently in prison? how</li>
  <li>seems he to be touched?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Provost">
  <li>A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but</li>
  <li class="number">as a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless</li>
  <li>of what’s past, present, or to come; insensible of</li>
  <li>mortality, and desperately mortal.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>He wants advice.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Provost">
  <li>He will hear none: he hath evermore had the liberty</li>
  <li class="number">of the prison; give him leave to escape hence, he</li>
  <li>would not: drunk many times a day, if not many days</li>
  <li>entirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him, as if</li>
  <li>to carry him to execution, and showed him a seeming</li>
  <li>warrant for it: it hath not moved him at all.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li class="number">More of him anon. There is written in your brow,</li>
  <li>provost, honesty and constancy: if I read it not</li>
  <li>truly, my ancient skill beguiles me; but, in the</li>
  <li>boldness of my cunning, I will lay myself in hazard.</li>
  <li>Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is</li>
  <li class="number">no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath</li>
  <li>sentenced him. To make you understand this in a</li>
  <li>manifested effect, I crave but four days’ respite;</li>
  <li>for the which you are to do me both a present and a</li>
  <li>dangerous courtesy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Provost">
  <li class="number">Pray, sir, in what?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>In the delaying death.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Provost">
  <li>A lack, how may I do it, having the hour limited,</li>
  <li>and an express command, under penalty, to deliver</li>
  <li>his head in the view of Angelo? I may make my case</li>
  <li class="number">as Claudio’s, to cross this in the smallest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>By the vow of mine order I warrant you, if my</li>
  <li>instructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardine</li>
  <li>be this morning executed, and his head born to Angelo.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Provost">
  <li>Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li class="number">O, death’s a great disguiser; and you may add to it.</li>
  <li>Shave the head, and tie the beard; and say it was</li>
  <li>the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his</li>
  <li>death: you know the course is common. If any thing</li>
  <li>fall to you upon this, more than thanks and good</li>
  <li class="number">fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead</li>
  <li>against it with my life.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Provost">
  <li>Pardon me, good father; it is against my oath.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>Were you sworn to the duke, or to the deputy?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Provost">
  <li>To him, and to his substitutes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li class="number">You will think you have made no offence, if the duke</li>
  <li>avouch the justice of your dealing?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Provost">
  <li>But what likelihood is in that?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see</li>
  <li>you fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor</li>
  <li class="number">persuasion can with ease attempt you, I will go</li>
  <li>further than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you.</li>
  <li>Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the</li>
  <li>duke: you know the character, I doubt not; and the</li>
  <li>signet is not strange to you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Provost">
  <li class="number">I know them both.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>The contents of this is the return of the duke: you</li>
  <li>shall anon over-read it at your pleasure; where you</li>
  <li>shall find, within these two days he will be here.</li>
  <li>This is a thing that Angelo knows not; for he this</li>
  <li class="number">very day receives letters of strange tenor;</li>
  <li>perchance of the duke’s death; perchance entering</li>
  <li>into some monastery; but, by chance, nothing of what</li>
  <li>is writ. Look, the unfolding star calls up the</li>
  <li>shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these</li>
  <li class="number">things should be: all difficulties are but easy</li>
  <li>when they are known. Call your executioner, and off</li>
  <li>with Barnardine’s head: I will give him a present</li>
  <li>shrift and advise him for a better place. Yet you</li>
  <li>are amazed; but this shall absolutely resolve you.</li>
  <li class="number">Come away; it is almost clear dawn.</li>

<h3>SCENE I.  The city gate.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">MARIANA veiled, ISABELLA, and FRIAR PETER, at their
stand. Enter DUKE VINCENTIO, VARRIUS, Lords,
ANGELO, ESCALUS, LUCIO, Provost, Officers, and
Citizens, at several doors</div>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>My very worthy cousin, fairly met!</li>
  <li>Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO, ESCALUS">
  <li>Happy return be to your royal grace!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>Many and hearty thankings to you both.</li>
  <li class="number">We have made inquiry of you; and we hear</li>
  <li>Such goodness of your justice, that our soul</li>
  <li>Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks,</li>
  <li>Forerunning more requital.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li>You make my bonds still greater.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li class="number">O, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it,</li>
  <li>To lock it in the wards of covert bosom,</li>
  <li>When it deserves, with characters of brass,</li>
  <li>A forted residence ’gainst the tooth of time</li>
  <li>And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand,</li>
  <li class="number">And let the subject see, to make them know</li>
  <li>That outward courtesies would fain proclaim</li>
  <li>Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus,</li>
  <li>You must walk by us on our other hand;</li>
  <li>And good supporters are you.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">FRIAR PETER and ISABELLA come forward</div>

<ol data-speaker="FRIAR PETER">
  <li class="number">Now is your time: speak loud and kneel before him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>Justice, O royal duke! Vail your regard</li>
  <li>Upon a wrong’d, I would fain have said, a maid!</li>
  <li>O worthy prince, dishonour not your eye</li>
  <li>By throwing it on any other object</li>
  <li class="number">Till you have heard me in my true complaint</li>
  <li>And given me justice, justice, justice, justice!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.</li>
  <li>Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice:</li>
  <li>Reveal yourself to him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li class="number">O worthy duke,</li>
  <li>You bid me seek redemption of the devil:</li>
  <li>Hear me yourself; for that which I must speak</li>
  <li>Must either punish me, not being believed,</li>
  <li>Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me, here!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li class="number">My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm:</li>
  <li>She hath been a suitor to me for her brother</li>
  <li>Cut off by course of justice — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>By course of justice!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li>And she will speak most bitterly and strange.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li class="number">Most strange, but yet most truly, will I speak:</li>
  <li>That Angelo’s forsworn; is it not strange?</li>
  <li>That Angelo’s a murderer; is ’t not strange?</li>
  <li>That Angelo is an adulterous thief,</li>
  <li>An hypocrite, a virgin-violator;</li>
  <li class="number">Is it not strange and strange?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>Nay, it is ten times strange.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>It is not truer he is Angelo</li>
  <li>Than this is all as true as it is strange:</li>
  <li>Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth</li>
  <li class="number">To the end of reckoning.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>Away with her! Poor soul,</li>
  <li>She speaks this in the infirmity of sense.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>O prince, I conjure thee, as thou believest</li>
  <li>There is another comfort than this world,</li>
  <li class="number">That thou neglect me not, with that opinion</li>
  <li>That I am touch’d with madness! Make not impossible</li>
  <li>That which but seems unlike: ’tis not impossible</li>
  <li>But one, the wicked’st caitiff on the ground,</li>
  <li>May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute</li>
  <li class="number">As Angelo; even so may Angelo,</li>
  <li>In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,</li>
  <li>Be an arch-villain; believe it, royal prince:</li>
  <li>If he be less, he’s nothing; but he’s more,</li>
  <li>Had I more name for badness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li class="number">By mine honesty,</li>
  <li>If she be mad — as I believe no other — </li>
  <li>Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,</li>
  <li>Such a dependency of thing on thing,</li>
  <li>As e’er I heard in madness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li class="number">O gracious duke,</li>
  <li>Harp not on that, nor do not banish reason</li>
  <li>For inequality; but let your reason serve</li>
  <li>To make the truth appear where it seems hid,</li>
  <li>And hide the false seems true.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li class="number">Many that are not mad</li>
  <li>Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>I am the sister of one Claudio,</li>
  <li>Condemn’d upon the act of fornication</li>
  <li>To lose his head; condemn’d by Angelo:</li>
  <li class="number">I, in probation of a sisterhood,</li>
  <li>Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio</li>
  <li>As then the messenger — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>That’s I, an’t like your grace:</li>
  <li>I came to her from Claudio, and desired her</li>
  <li class="number">To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo</li>
  <li>For her poor brother’s pardon.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>That’s he indeed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>You were not bid to speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>No, my good lord;</li>
  <li class="number">Nor wish’d to hold my peace.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>I wish you now, then;</li>
  <li>Pray you, take note of it: and when you have</li>
  <li>A business for yourself, pray heaven you then</li>
  <li>Be perfect.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li class="number">I warrant your honour.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>The warrants for yourself; take heed to’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>This gentleman told somewhat of my tale — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>Right.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>It may be right; but you are i’ the wrong</li>
  <li class="number">To speak before your time. Proceed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>I went</li>
  <li>To this pernicious caitiff deputy — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>That’s somewhat madly spoken.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>Pardon it;</li>
  <li class="number">The phrase is to the matter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>Mended again. The matter; proceed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>In brief, to set the needless process by,</li>
  <li>How I persuaded, how I pray’d, and kneel’d,</li>
  <li>How he refell’d me, and how I replied — </li>
  <li class="number">For this was of much length — the vile conclusion</li>
  <li>I now begin with grief and shame to utter:</li>
  <li>He would not, but by gift of my chaste body</li>
  <li>To his concupiscible intemperate lust,</li>
  <li>Release my brother; and, after much debatement,</li>
  <li class="number">My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,</li>
  <li>And I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes,</li>
  <li>His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant</li>
  <li>For my poor brother’s head.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>This is most likely!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li class="number">O, that it were as like as it is true!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>By heaven, fond wretch, thou knowist not what thou speak’st,</li>
  <li>Or else thou art suborn’d against his honour</li>
  <li>In hateful practise. First, his integrity</li>
  <li>Stands without blemish. Next, it imports no reason</li>
  <li class="number">That with such vehemency he should pursue</li>
  <li>Faults proper to himself: if he had so offended,</li>
  <li>He would have weigh’d thy brother by himself</li>
  <li>And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on:</li>
  <li>Confess the truth, and say by whose advice</li>
  <li class="number">Thou camest here to complain.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>And is this all?</li>
  <li>Then, O you blessed ministers above,</li>
  <li>Keep me in patience, and with ripen’d time</li>
  <li>Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up</li>
  <li class="number">In countenance! Heaven shield your grace from woe,</li>
  <li>As I, thus wrong’d, hence unbelieved go!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>I know you’ld fain be gone. An officer!</li>
  <li>To prison with her! Shall we thus permit</li>
  <li>A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall</li>
  <li class="number">On him so near us? This needs must be a practise.</li>
  <li>Who knew of Your intent and coming hither?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISABELLA">
  <li>One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>My lord, I know him; ’tis a meddling friar;</li>
  <li class="number">I do not like the man: had he been lay, my lord</li>
  <li>For certain words he spake against your grace</li>
  <li>In your retirement, I had swinged him soundly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>Words against me? this is a good friar, belike!</li>
  <li>And to set on this wretched woman here</li>
  <li class="number">Against our substitute! Let this friar be found.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,</li>
  <li>I saw them at the prison: a saucy friar,</li>
  <li>A very scurvy fellow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FRIAR PETER">
  <li>Blessed be your royal grace!</li>
  <li class="number">I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard</li>
  <li>Your royal ear abused. First, hath this woman</li>
  <li>Most wrongfully accused your substitute,</li>
  <li>Who is as free from touch or soil with her</li>
  <li>As she from one ungot.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li class="number">We did believe no less.</li>
  <li>Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FRIAR PETER">
  <li>I know him for a man divine and holy;</li>
  <li>Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,</li>
  <li>As he’s reported by this gentleman;</li>
  <li class="number">And, on my trust, a man that never yet</li>
  <li>Did, as he vouches, misreport your grace.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>My lord, most villanously; believe it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FRIAR PETER">
  <li>Well, he in time may come to clear himself;</li>
  <li>But at this instant he is sick my lord,</li>
  <li class="number">Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request,</li>
  <li>Being come to knowledge that there was complaint</li>
  <li>Intended ’gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither,</li>
  <li>To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know</li>
  <li>Is true and false; and what he with his oath</li>
  <li class="number">And all probation will make up full clear,</li>
  <li>Whensoever he’s convented. First, for this woman.</li>
  <li>To justify this worthy nobleman,</li>
  <li>So vulgarly and personally accused,</li>
  <li>Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,</li>
  <li class="number">Till she herself confess it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>Good friar, let’s hear it.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">ISABELLA is carried off guarded; and MARIANA comes forward</li>
  <li>Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?</li>
  <li>O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!</li>
  <li>Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo;</li>
  <li class="number">In this I’ll be impartial; be you judge</li>
  <li>Of your own cause. Is this the witness, friar?</li>
  <li>First, let her show her face, and after speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARIANA">
  <li>Pardon, my lord; I will not show my face</li>
  <li>Until my husband bid me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li class="number">What, are you married?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARIANA">
  <li>No, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>Are you a maid?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARIANA">
  <li>No, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>A widow, then?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARIANA">
  <li class="number">Neither, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>Why, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor wife?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>My lord, she may be a punk; for many of them are</li>
  <li>neither maid, widow, nor wife.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>Silence that fellow: I would he had some cause</li>
  <li class="number">To prattle for himself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>Well, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARIANA">
  <li>My lord; I do confess I ne’er was married;</li>
  <li>And I confess besides I am no maid:</li>
  <li>I have known my husband; yet my husband</li>
  <li class="number">Knows not that ever he knew me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>He was drunk then, my lord: it can be no better.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>Well, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>This is no witness for Lord Angelo.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARIANA">
  <li class="number">Now I come to’t my lord</li>
  <li>She that accuses him of fornication,</li>
  <li>In self-same manner doth accuse my husband,</li>
  <li>And charges him my lord, with such a time</li>
  <li>When I’ll depose I had him in mine arms</li>
  <li class="number">With all the effect of love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li>Charges she more than me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARIANA">
  <li>Not that I know.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>No? you say your husband.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARIANA">
  <li>Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,</li>
  <li class="number">Who thinks he knows that he ne’er knew my body,</li>
  <li>But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel’s.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li>This is a strange abuse. Let’s see thy face.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARIANA">
  <li>My husband bids me; now I will unmask.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Unveiling</li>
  <li>This is that face, thou cruel Angelo,</li>
  <li class="number">Which once thou sworest was worth the looking on;</li>
  <li>This is the hand which, with a vow’d contract,</li>
  <li>Was fast belock’d in thine; this is the body</li>
  <li>That took away the match from Isabel,</li>
  <li>And did supply thee at thy garden-house</li>
  <li class="number">In her imagined person.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>Know you this woman?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>Carnally, she says.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>Sirrah, no more!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO">
  <li>Enough, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li class="number">My lord, I must confess I know this woman:</li>
  <li>And five years since there was some speech of marriage</li>
  <li>Betwixt myself and her; which was broke off,</li>
  <li>Partly for that her promised proportions</li>
  <li>Came short of composition, but in chief</li>
  <li class="number">For that her reputation was disvalued</li>
  <li>In levity: since which time of five years</li>
  <li>I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,</li>
  <li>Upon my faith and honour.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARIANA">
  <li>Noble prince,</li>
  <li class="number">As there comes light from heaven and words from breath,</li>
  <li>As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,</li>
  <li>I am affianced this man’s wife as strongly</li>
  <li>As words could make up vows: and, my good lord,</li>
  <li>But Tuesday night last gone in’s garden-house</li>
  <li class="number">He knew me as a wife. As this is true,</li>
  <li>Let me in safety raise me from my knees</li>
  <li>Or else for ever be confixed here,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li>I did but smile till now:</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE VINCENTIO">
  <li>Ay, with my heart</li>
  <li>And punish them to your height of pleasure.</li>
  <li>Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,</li>

  <li class="number">Though they would swear down each particular saint,</li>
