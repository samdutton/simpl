<h3>SCENE I.  Verona. A public place.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet,
armed with swords and bucklers</div>

<ol data-speaker="SAMPSON">
  <li>Gregory, o’ my word, we’ll not carry coals.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREGORY">
  <li>No, for then we should be colliers.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAMPSON">
  <li>I mean, an we be in choler, we’ll draw.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREGORY">
  <li>Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o’ the collar.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAMPSON">
  <li class="number">I strike quickly, being moved.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREGORY">
  <li>But thou art not quickly moved to strike.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAMPSON">
  <li>A dog of the house of Montague moves me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREGORY">
  <li>To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:</li>
  <li>therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn’st away.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAMPSON">
  <li class="number">A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will</li>
  <li>take the wall of any man or maid of Montague’s.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREGORY">
  <li>That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes</li>
  <li>to the wall.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAMPSON">
  <li>True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,</li>
  <li class="number">are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push</li>
  <li>Montague’s men from the wall, and thrust his maids</li>
  <li>to the wall.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREGORY">
  <li>The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAMPSON">
  <li>’Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I</li>
  <li class="number">have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the</li>
  <li>maids, and cut off their heads.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREGORY">
  <li>The heads of the maids?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAMPSON">
  <li>Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;</li>
  <li>take it in what sense thou wilt.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREGORY">
  <li class="number">They must take it in sense that feel it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAMPSON">
  <li>Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and</li>
  <li>’tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREGORY">
  <li>’Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou</li>
  <li>hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes</li>
  <li class="number">two of the house of the Montagues.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAMPSON">
  <li>My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREGORY">
  <li>How! turn thy back and run?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAMPSON">
  <li>Fear me not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREGORY">
  <li>No, marry; I fear thee!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAMPSON">
  <li class="number">Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREGORY">
  <li>I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as</li>
  <li>they list.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAMPSON">
  <li>Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;</li>
  <li>which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR</div>

<ol data-speaker="ABRAHAM">
  <li class="number">Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAMPSON">
  <li>I do bite my thumb, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ABRAHAM">
  <li>Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAMPSON">
  <li><stagedir>Aside to GREGORY</stagedir>  Is the law of our side, if I say</li>
  <li>ay?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREGORY">
  <li class="number">No.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAMPSON">
  <li>No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I</li>
  <li>bite my thumb, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREGORY">
  <li>Do you quarrel, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ABRAHAM">
  <li>Quarrel sir! no, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAMPSON">
  <li class="number">If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ABRAHAM">
  <li>No better.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAMPSON">
  <li>Well, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREGORY">
  <li>Say ’better:’ here comes one of my master’s kinsmen.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAMPSON">
  <li>Yes, better, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ABRAHAM">
  <li class="number">You lie.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAMPSON">
  <li>Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">They fight</div>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter BENVOLIO</div>

<ol data-speaker="BENVOLIO">
  <li>Part, fools!</li>
  <li>Put up your swords; you know not what you do.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Beats down their swords</div>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter TYBALT</div>

<ol data-speaker="TYBALT">
  <li>What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?</li>
  <li class="number">Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENVOLIO">
  <li>I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,</li>
  <li>Or manage it to part these men with me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TYBALT">
  <li>What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,</li>
  <li>As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:</li>
  <li class="number">Have at thee, coward!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">They fight</div>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray;
then enter Citizens, with clubs</div>

<ol data-speaker="First Citizen">
  <li>Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!</li>
  <li>Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET</div>

<ol data-speaker="CAPULET">
  <li>What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY CAPULET">
  <li>A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAPULET">
  <li class="number">My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,</li>
  <li>And flourishes his blade in spite of me.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE</div>

<ol data-speaker="MONTAGUE">
  <li>Thou villain Capulet — Hold me not, let me go.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY MONTAGUE">
  <li>Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter PRINCE, with Attendants</div>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE">
  <li>Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,</li>
  <li class="number">Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel — </li>
  <li>Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,</li>
  <li>That quench the fire of your pernicious rage</li>
  <li>With purple fountains issuing from your veins,</li>
  <li>On pain of torture, from those bloody hands</li>
  <li class="number">Throw your mistemper’d weapons to the ground,</li>
  <li>And hear the sentence of your moved prince.</li>
  <li>Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,</li>
  <li>By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,</li>
  <li>Have thrice disturb’d the quiet of our streets,</li>
  <li class="number">And made Verona’s ancient citizens</li>
  <li>Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,</li>
  <li>To wield old partisans, in hands as old,</li>
  <li>Canker’d with peace, to part your canker’d hate:</li>
  <li>If ever you disturb our streets again,</li>
  <li class="number">Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.</li>
  <li>For this time, all the rest depart away:</li>
  <li>You Capulet; shall go along with me:</li>
  <li>And, Montague, come you this afternoon,</li>
  <li>To know our further pleasure in this case,</li>
  <li class="number">To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.</li>
  <li>Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO</div>

<ol data-speaker="MONTAGUE">
  <li>Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?</li>
  <li>Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENVOLIO">
  <li>Here were the servants of your adversary,</li>
  <li class="number">And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:</li>
  <li>I drew to part them: in the instant came</li>
  <li>The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,</li>
  <li>Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,</li>
  <li>He swung about his head and cut the winds,</li>
  <li class="number">Who nothing hurt withal hiss’d him in scorn:</li>
  <li>While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,</li>
  <li>Came more and more and fought on part and part,</li>
  <li>Till the prince came, who parted either part.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY MONTAGUE">
  <li>O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?</li>
  <li class="number">Right glad I am he was not at this fray.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENVOLIO">
  <li>Madam, an hour before the worshipp’d sun</li>
  <li>Peer’d forth the golden window of the east,</li>
  <li>A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;</li>
  <li>Where, underneath the grove of sycamore</li>
  <li class="number">That westward rooteth from the city’s side,</li>
  <li>So early walking did I see your son:</li>
  <li>Towards him I made, but he was ware of me</li>
  <li>And stole into the covert of the wood:</li>
  <li>I, measuring his affections by my own,</li>
  <li class="number">That most are busied when they’re most alone,</li>
  <li>Pursued my humour not pursuing his,</li>
  <li>And gladly shunn’d who gladly fled from me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MONTAGUE">
  <li>Many a morning hath he there been seen,</li>
  <li>With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.</li>
  <li class="number">Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;</li>
  <li>But all so soon as the all-cheering sun</li>
  <li>Should in the furthest east begin to draw</li>
  <li>The shady curtains from Aurora’s bed,</li>
  <li>Away from the light steals home my heavy son,</li>
  <li class="number">And private in his chamber pens himself,</li>
  <li>Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out</li>
  <li>And makes himself an artificial night:</li>
  <li>Black and portentous must this humour prove,</li>
  <li>Unless good counsel may the cause remove.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENVOLIO">
  <li class="number">My noble uncle, do you know the cause?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MONTAGUE">
  <li>I neither know it nor can learn of him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENVOLIO">
  <li>Have you importuned him by any means?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MONTAGUE">
  <li>Both by myself and many other friends:</li>
  <li>But he, his own affections’ counsellor,</li>
  <li class="number">Is to himself — I will not say how true — </li>
  <li>But to himself so secret and so close,</li>
  <li>So far from sounding and discovery,</li>
  <li>As is the bud bit with an envious worm,</li>
  <li>Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,</li>
  <li class="number">Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.</li>
  <li>Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.</li>
  <li>We would as willingly give cure as know.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter ROMEO</div>

<ol data-speaker="BENVOLIO">
  <li>See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;</li>
  <li>I’ll know his grievance, or be much denied.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MONTAGUE">
  <li class="number">I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,</li>
  <li>To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let’s away.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE</div>

<ol data-speaker="BENVOLIO">
  <li>Good-morrow, cousin.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROMEO">
  <li>Is the day so young?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENVOLIO">
  <li>But new struck nine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROMEO">
  <li class="number">Ay me! sad hours seem long.</li>
  <li>Was that my father that went hence so fast?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENVOLIO">
  <li>It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo’s hours?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROMEO">
  <li>Not having that, which, having, makes them short.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENVOLIO">
  <li>In love?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROMEO">
  <li class="number">Out — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENVOLIO">
  <li>Of love?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROMEO">
  <li>Out of her favour, where I am in love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENVOLIO">
  <li>Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,</li>
  <li>Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROMEO">
  <li class="number">Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,</li>
  <li>Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!</li>
  <li>Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?</li>
  <li>Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.</li>
  <li>Here’s much to do with hate, but more with love.</li>
  <li class="number">Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!</li>
  <li>O any thing, of nothing first create!</li>
  <li>O heavy lightness! serious vanity!</li>
  <li>Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!</li>
  <li>Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,</li>
  <li class="number">sick health!</li>
  <li>Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!</li>
  <li>This love feel I, that feel no love in this.</li>
  <li>Dost thou not laugh?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENVOLIO">
  <li>No, coz, I rather weep.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROMEO">
  <li class="number">Good heart, at what?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENVOLIO">
  <li>At thy good heart’s oppression.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROMEO">
  <li>Why, such is love’s transgression.</li>
  <li>Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,</li>
  <li>Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest</li>
  <li class="number">With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown</li>
  <li>Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.</li>
  <li>Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;</li>
  <li>Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes;</li>
  <li>Being vex’d a sea nourish’d with lovers’ tears:</li>
  <li class="number">What is it else? a madness most discreet,</li>
  <li>A choking gall and a preserving sweet.</li>
  <li>Farewell, my coz.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENVOLIO">
  <li>Soft! I will go along;</li>
  <li>An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROMEO">
  <li class="number">Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;</li>
  <li>This is not Romeo, he’s some other where.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENVOLIO">
  <li>Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROMEO">
  <li>What, shall I groan and tell thee?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENVOLIO">
  <li>Groan! why, no.</li>
  <li class="number">But sadly tell me who.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROMEO">
  <li>Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:</li>
  <li>Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!</li>
  <li>In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENVOLIO">
  <li>I aim’d so near, when I supposed you loved.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROMEO">
  <li class="number">A right good mark-man! And she’s fair I love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENVOLIO">
  <li>A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROMEO">
  <li>Well, in that hit you miss: she’ll not be hit</li>
  <li>With Cupid’s arrow; she hath Dian’s wit;</li>
  <li>And, in strong proof of chastity well arm’d,</li>
  <li class="number">From love’s weak childish bow she lives unharm’d.</li>
  <li>She will not stay the siege of loving terms,</li>
  <li>Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,</li>
  <li>Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:</li>
  <li>O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,</li>
  <li class="number">That when she dies with beauty dies her store.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENVOLIO">
  <li>Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROMEO">
  <li>She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,</li>
  <li>For beauty starved with her severity</li>
  <li>Cuts beauty off from all posterity.</li>
  <li class="number">She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,</li>
  <li>To merit bliss by making me despair:</li>
  <li>She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow</li>
  <li>Do I live dead that live to tell it now.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENVOLIO">
  <li>Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROMEO">
  <li class="number">O, teach me how I should forget to think.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENVOLIO">
  <li>By giving liberty unto thine eyes;</li>
  <li>Examine other beauties.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROMEO">
  <li>’Tis the way</li>
  <li>To call hers exquisite, in question more:</li>
  <li class="number">These happy masks that kiss fair ladies’ brows</li>
  <li>Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;</li>
  <li>He that is strucken blind cannot forget</li>
  <li>The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:</li>
  <li>Show me a mistress that is passing fair,</li>
  <li class="number">What doth her beauty serve, but as a note</li>
  <li>Where I may read who pass’d that passing fair?</li>
  <li>Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENVOLIO">
  <li>I’ll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.</li>
</ol>

<h3>SCENE II.  A street.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter CAPULET, PARIS, and Servant</div>

<ol data-speaker="CAPULET">
  <li>But Montague is bound as well as I,</li>

<ol data-speaker="PARIS">
  <li>Of honourable reckoning are you both;</li>
  <li class="number">And pity ’tis you lived at odds so long.</li>
  <li>But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?</li>

<ol data-speaker="CAPULET">
  <li>But saying o’er what I have said before:</li>

  <li>She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,</li>

  <li>My will to her consent is but a part;</li>
  <li>An she agree, within her scope of choice</li>

  <li>One more, most welcome, makes my number more.</li>
  <li>At my poor house look to behold this night</li>

  <li>When well-apparell’d April on the heel</li>
  <li>Of limping winter treads, even such delight</li>
  <li>Among fresh female buds shall you this night</li>
  <li class="number">Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,</li>

  <li>She was too good for me: but, as I said,</li>
  <li class="number">On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;</li>
  <li>That shall she, marry; I remember it well.</li>
  <li>’Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;</li>
  <li>And she was wean’d — I never shall forget it — </li>
  <li>Of all the days of the year, upon that day:</li>
  <li class="number">For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,</li>
  <li>Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;</li>
  <li>My lord and you were then at Mantua: — </li>
  <li>Nay, I do bear a brain: — but, as I said,</li>

  <li>For even the day before, she broke her brow:</li>
  <li>And then my husband — God be with his soul!</li>
  <li>A’ was a merry man — took up the child:</li>
  <li class="number">’Yea,’ quoth he, ’dost thou fall upon thy face?</li>
  <li>Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;</li>
  <li>Wilt thou not, Jule?’ and, by my holidame,</li>

  <li class="number">I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,</li>

<ol data-speaker="Nurse">
  <li>Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,</li>

  <li>And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow</li>
  <li>A bump as big as a young cockerel’s stone;</li>
  <li>A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:</li>
  <li>’Yea,’ quoth my husband,’fall’st upon thy face?</li>
  <li class="number">Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;</li>
  <li>Wilt thou not, Jule?’ it stinted and said ’Ay.’</li>

<ol data-speaker="LADY CAPULET">

  <li>Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,</li>

  <li>And find delight writ there with beauty’s pen;</li>
  <li>Examine every married lineament,</li>
  <li>And see how one another lends content</li>
  <li>And what obscured in this fair volume lies</li>
  <li class="number">Find written in the margent of his eyes.</li>
  <li>This precious book of love, this unbound lover,</li>
  <li>To beautify him, only lacks a cover:</li>
  <li>The fish lives in the sea, and ’tis much pride</li>
  <li>For fair without the fair within to hide:</li>
  <li class="number">That book in many’s eyes doth share the glory,</li>
  <li>That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;</li>
  <li>So shall you share all that he doth possess,</li>
  <li>By having him, making yourself no less.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Nurse">
  <li>No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.</li>
</ol>

Maskers, Torch-bearers, and others</div>

<ol data-speaker="ROMEO">
  <li>What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?</li>
  <li>Or shall we on without a apology?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENVOLIO">
  <li>The date is out of such prolixity:</li>
  <li>We’ll have no Cupid hoodwink’d with a scarf,</li>
  <li class="number">Bearing a Tartar’s painted bow of lath,</li>
  <li>Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;</li>
  <li>Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke</li>

<ol data-speaker="ROMEO">
  <li>Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;</li>
  <li>Being but heavy, I will bear the light.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MERCUTIO">
  <li>Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROMEO">
  <li>Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes</li>
  <li class="number">With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead</li>
  <li>So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MERCUTIO">
  <li>You are a lover; borrow Cupid’s wings,</li>
  <li>And soar with them above a common bound.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROMEO">
  <li>I am too sore enpierced with his shaft</li>
  <li class="number">To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,</li>
  <li>I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:</li>
  <li>Under love’s heavy burden do I sink.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MERCUTIO">
  <li>And, to sink in it, should you burden love;</li>
  <li>Too great oppression for a tender thing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROMEO">
  <li class="number">Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,</li>
  <li>Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MERCUTIO">
  <li>If love be rough with you, be rough with love;</li>
  <li>Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.</li>
  <li>Give me a case to put my visage in:</li>
  <li class="number">A visor for a visor! what care I</li>
  <li>What curious eye doth quote deformities?</li>
  <li>Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.</li>

  <li>I’ll be a candle-holder, and look on.</li>

  <li>If thou art dun, we’ll draw thee from the mire</li>
  <li>Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick’st</li>
  <li>Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!</li>

<ol data-speaker="ROMEO">
  <li>Nay, that’s not so.</li>

<ol data-speaker="MERCUTIO">
  <li class="number">I mean, sir, in delay</li>
  <li>We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.</li>

<ol data-speaker="MERCUTIO">
  <li>O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.</li>
  <li>She is the fairies’ midwife, and she comes</li>
  <li>In shape no bigger than an agate-stone</li>
  <li class="number">On the fore-finger of an alderman,</li>
  <li>Drawn with a team of little atomies</li>
  <li>Athwart men’s noses as they lie asleep;</li>
  <li>Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders’ legs,</li>
  <li>The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,</li>
  <li class="number">The traces of the smallest spider’s web,</li>
  <li>The collars of the moonshine’s watery beams,</li>
  <li>Her whip of cricket’s bone, the lash of film,</li>
  <li>Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,</li>
  <li>Not so big as a round little worm</li>
  <li class="number">Prick’d from the lazy finger of a maid;</li>
  <li>Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut</li>
  <li>Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,</li>
  <li>Time out o’ mind the fairies’ coachmakers.</li>
  <li>And in this state she gallops night by night</li>
  <li class="number">Through lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love;</li>
  <li>O’er courtiers’ knees, that dream on court’sies straight,</li>
  <li>O’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees,</li>
  <li>O’er ladies ’ lips, who straight on kisses dream,</li>
  <li>Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,</li>
  <li class="number">Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:</li>
  <li>Sometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose,</li>
  <li>And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;</li>
  <li>And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail</li>
  <li>Tickling a parson’s nose as a’ lies asleep,</li>
  <li class="number">Then dreams, he of another benefice:</li>
  <li>Sometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck,</li>
  <li>And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,</li>
  <li>Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,</li>
  <li>Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon</li>
  <li class="number">Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,</li>
  <li>And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two</li>
  <li>And sleeps again. This is that very Mab</li>
  <li>That plats the manes of horses in the night,</li>
  <li>And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,</li>
  <li class="number">Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:</li>
  <li>This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,</li>
  <li>That presses them and learns them first to bear,</li>
  <li>Making them women of good carriage:</li>
  <li>This is she — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROMEO">
  <li class="number">Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!</li>
  <li>Thou talk’st of nothing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MERCUTIO">
  <li>True, I talk of dreams,</li>
  <li>Which are the children of an idle brain,</li>
  <li>Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,</li>
  <li class="number">Which is as thin of substance as the air</li>
  <li>And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes</li>
  <li>Even now the frozen bosom of the north,</li>
  <li>And, being anger’d, puffs away from thence,</li>
  <li>Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.</li>

  <li>Supper is done, and we shall come too late.</li>

  <li>I fear, too early: for my mind misgives</li>
  <li>Some consequence yet hanging in the stars</li>
  <li>Shall bitterly begin his fearful date</li>
  <li class="number">With this night’s revels and expire the term</li>
  <li>Of a despised life closed in my breast</li>
  <li>By some vile forfeit of untimely death.</li>

  <li class="stage-direction">JULIET appears above at a window</li>

  <li>It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.</li>
  <li>Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,</li>
  <li class="number">Who is already sick and pale with grief,</li>
  <li>That thou her maid art far more fair than she:</li>

  <li>I am too bold, ’tis not to me she speaks:</li>
  <li class="number">Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,</li>
  <li>Having some business, do entreat her eyes</li>
  <li>To twinkle in their spheres till they return.</li>
  <li>What if her eyes were there, they in her head?</li>
  <li>The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,</li>
  <li class="number">As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven</li>

  <li>Had I it written, I would tear the word.</li>
</ol>

  <li class="number">Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JULIET">
  <li>How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?</li>
  <li>The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,</li>

  <li>If any of my kinsmen find thee here.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROMEO">
  <li class="number">With love’s light wings did I o’er-perch these walls;</li>
  <li>For stony limits cannot hold love out,</li>
  <li>And what love can do that dares love attempt;</li>
  <li>Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JULIET">
  <li>If they do see thee, they will murder thee.</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROMEO">
  <li>I have night’s cloak to hide me from their sight;</li>

  <li>My life were better ended by their hate,</li>
  <li>Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JULIET">
  <li>By whose direction found’st thou out this place?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROMEO">
  <li>By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;</li>
  <li class="number">He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.</li>
  <li>I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far</li>
  <li>As that vast shore wash’d with the farthest sea,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JULIET">
  <li>Thou know’st the mask of night is on my face,</li>

  <li>For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night</li>
  <li>Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny</li>
  <li>What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!</li>
  <li>Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say ’Ay,’</li>
  <li class="number">And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear’st,</li>
  <li>Thou mayst prove false; at lovers’ perjuries</li>
  <li>Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,</li>
  <li>If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:</li>
  <li>Or if thou think’st I am too quickly won,</li>
  <li class="number">I’ll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,</li>
  <li>So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.</li>
  <li>In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,</li>
  <li>And therefore thou mayst think my ’havior light:</li>
  <li>But trust me, gentleman, I’ll prove more true</li>
  <li class="number">Than those that have more cunning to be strange.</li>
  <li>I should have been more strange, I must confess,</li>
  <li>But that thou overheard’st, ere I was ware,</li>
  <li>My true love’s passion: therefore pardon me,</li>
  <li>And not impute this yielding to light love,</li>

  <li class="number">Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,</li>

  <li>The earth that’s nature’s mother is her tomb;</li>
  <li class="number">What is her burying grave that is her womb,</li>
  <li>And from her womb children of divers kind</li>
  <li>We sucking on her natural bosom find,</li>
  <li>Many for many virtues excellent,</li>
  <li>None but for some and yet all different.</li>
  <li class="number">O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies</li>
  <li>In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:</li>
  <li>For nought so vile that on the earth doth live</li>
  <li>But to the earth some special good doth give,</li>
  <li>Nor aught so good but strain’d from that fair use</li>
  <li class="number">Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:</li>
  <li>Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;</li>
  <li>And vice sometimes by action dignified.</li>
  <li>Within the infant rind of this small flower</li>
  <li>Poison hath residence and medicine power:</li>
  <li class="number">For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;</li>
  <li>Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.</li>
  <li>Two such opposed kings encamp them still</li>

  <li>What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?</li>
  <li>Young son, it argues a distemper’d head</li>
  <li class="number">So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:</li>
  <li>Care keeps his watch in every old man’s eye,</li>

  <li>But where unbruised youth with unstuff’d brain</li>
  <li>Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:</li>

  <li>Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;</li>
  <li>Or if not so, then here I hit it right,</li>

  <li>And all combined, save what thou must combine</li>
  <li>By holy marriage: when and where and how</li>
  <li>We met, we woo’d and made exchange of vow,</li>
  <li>I’ll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,</li>

<ol data-speaker="FRIAR LAURENCE">
  <li>Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!</li>
  <li>Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,</li>

  <li>Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.</li>
  <li class="number">Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine</li>
  <li>Hath wash’d thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!</li>
  <li>How much salt water thrown away in waste,</li>
  <li>To season love, that of it doth not taste!</li>
  <li>The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,</li>
  <li class="number">Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;</li>
  <li>Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit</li>
  <li>Of an old tear that is not wash’d off yet:</li>
  <li>If e’er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,</li>
  <li>Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:</li>
  <li class="number">And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,</li>
  <li>Women may fall, when there’s no strength in men.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROMEO">
  <li>Thou chid’st me oft for loving Rosaline.</li>

<ol data-speaker="FRIAR LAURENCE">
  <li>For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ROMEO">
  <li>And bad’st me bury love.</li>

  <li class="number">O, she knew well</li>

  <li>In one respect I’ll thy assistant be;</li>
  <li>For this alliance may so happy prove,</li>

  <li>Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a</li>

  <li>Why, what is Tybalt?</li>

<ol data-speaker="MERCUTIO">
  <li>More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is</li>

  <li>Nay, good goose, bite not.</li>

  <li>Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most</li>

  <li class="number">now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art</li>

  <li>Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of</li>

  <li>Cold death aside, and with the other sends</li>
  <li>It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,</li>

  <li>’Hold, friends! friends, part!’ and, swifter than</li>
  <li class="number">his tongue,</li>
  <li>His agile arm beats down their fatal points,</li>
  <li>And ’twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm</li>
  <li>An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life</li>
  <li>Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;</li>
  <li class="number">But by and by comes back to Romeo,</li>
  <li>Who had but newly entertain’d revenge,</li>
  <li>And to ’t they go like lightning, for, ere I</li>
  <li>Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.</li>
  <li>And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.</li>
  <li class="number">This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.</li>

  <li>He is a kinsman to the Montague;</li>

  <li>Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,</li>
  <li>Towards Phoebus’ lodging: such a wagoner</li>
  <li>As Phaethon would whip you to the west,</li>
  <li>And bring in cloudy night immediately.</li>
  <li class="number">Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,</li>
  <li>That runaway’s eyes may wink and Romeo</li>

  <li>Lovers can see to do their amorous rites</li>
  <li>By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,</li>
  <li class="number">It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,</li>
  <li>Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,</li>
  <li>And learn me how to lose a winning match,</li>
  <li>Play’d for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:</li>
  <li>Hood my unmann’d blood, bating in my cheeks,</li>
  <li class="number">With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,</li>
  <li>Think true love acted simple modesty.</li>
  <li>Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;</li>
  <li>For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night</li>
  <li>Whiter than new snow on a raven’s back.</li>
  <li class="number">Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow’d night,</li>
  <li>Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,</li>
  <li>Take him and cut him out in little stars,</li>
  <li>And he will make the face of heaven so fine</li>
  <li>That all the world will be in love with night</li>
  <li class="number">And pay no worship to the garish sun.</li>
  <li>O, I have bought the mansion of a love,</li>

  <li>Not yet enjoy’d: so tedious is this day</li>
  <li>As is the night before some festival</li>

  <li class="stage-direction">Enter Nurse, with cords</li>

  <li class="number">Just opposite to what thou justly seem’st,</li>

  <li>Ah, where’s my man? give me some aqua vitae:</li>
  <li>These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.</li>
  <li>Shame come to Romeo!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JULIET">
  <li>Blister’d be thy tongue</li>
  <li class="number">For such a wish! he was not born to shame:</li>

  <li>Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,</li>
  <li>When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?</li>
  <li>But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?</li>
  <li class="number">That villain cousin would have kill’d my husband:</li>
  <li>Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;</li>
  <li>Your tributary drops belong to woe,</li>
  <li>Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.</li>
  <li>My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;</li>
  <li class="number">And Tybalt’s dead, that would have slain my husband:</li>
  <li>All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?</li>
  <li>Some word there was, worser than Tybalt’s death,</li>
  <li>That murder’d me: I would forget it fain;</li>
  <li>But, O, it presses to my memory,</li>
  <li class="number">Like damned guilty deeds to sinners’ minds:</li>
  <li>’Tybalt is dead, and Romeo — banished;’</li>
  <li>That ’banished,’ that one word ’banished,’</li>
  <li>Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt’s death</li>
  <li>Was woe enough, if it had ended there:</li>
  <li class="number">Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship</li>
  <li>And needly will be rank’d with other griefs,</li>

  <li>Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,</li>
  <li>Which modern lamentations might have moved?</li>
  <li class="number">But with a rear-ward following Tybalt’s death,</li>
  <li>’Romeo is banished,’ to speak that word,</li>
  <li>Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,</li>
  <li>All slain, all dead. ’Romeo is banished!’</li>
  <li>There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,</li>
  <li class="number">In that word’s death; no words can that woe sound.</li>
  <li>Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Nurse">
  <li>Weeping and wailing over Tybalt’s corse:</li>
  <li>Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.</li>

<ol data-speaker="JULIET">
  <li>Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,</li>
  <li class="number">When theirs are dry, for Romeo’s banishment.</li>
  <li>Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,</li>
  <li>Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:</li>
  <li>He made you for a highway to my bed;</li>
  <li>But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.</li>
  <li class="number">Come, cords, come, nurse; I’ll to my wedding-bed;</li>
  <li>And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Nurse">
  <li>Hie to your chamber: I’ll find Romeo</li>
  <li>To comfort you: I wot well where he is.</li>
  <li>Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:</li>
  <li class="number">I’ll to him; he is hid at Laurence’ cell.</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter ROMEO</div>

<ol data-speaker="ROMEO">
  <li>Father, what news? what is the prince’s doom?</li>
  <li class="number">What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,</li>
  <li>That I yet know not?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FRIAR LAURENCE">
  <li>Too familiar</li>

  <li>I bring thee tidings of the prince’s doom.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROMEO">
  <li class="number">What less than dooms-day is the prince’s doom?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FRIAR LAURENCE">
  <li>A gentler judgment vanish’d from his lips,</li>
  <li>Not body’s death, but body’s banishment.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROMEO">
  <li>Ha, banishment! be merciful, say ’death;’</li>
  <li>For exile hath more terror in his look,</li>
  <li class="number">Much more than death: do not say ’banishment.’</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FRIAR LAURENCE">
  <li>Hence from Verona art thou banished:</li>
  <li>Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROMEO">
  <li>There is no world without Verona walls,</li>
  <li>But purgatory, torture, hell itself.</li>
  <li class="number">Hence-banished is banish’d from the world,</li>
  <li>And world’s exile is death: then banished,</li>

  <li>And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FRIAR LAURENCE">
  <li class="number">O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!</li>
  <li>Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,</li>
  <li>Taking thy part, hath rush’d aside the law,</li>
  <li>And turn’d that black word death to banishment:</li>
  <li>This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROMEO">
  <li class="number">’Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,</li>
  <li>Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog</li>
  <li>And little mouse, every unworthy thing,</li>
  <li>Live here in heaven and may look on her;</li>
  <li>But Romeo may not: more validity,</li>
  <li class="number">More honourable state, more courtship lives</li>
  <li>In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize</li>
  <li>On the white wonder of dear Juliet’s hand</li>
  <li>And steal immortal blessing from her lips,</li>
  <li>Who even in pure and vestal modesty,</li>
  <li class="number">Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;</li>
  <li>But Romeo may not; he is banished:</li>
  <li>Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:</li>
  <li>They are free men, but I am banished.</li>
  <li>And say’st thou yet that exile is not death?</li>
  <li class="number">Hadst thou no poison mix’d, no sharp-ground knife,</li>
  <li>No sudden mean of death, though ne’er so mean,</li>
  <li>But ’banished’ to kill me? — ’banished’?</li>
  <li>O friar, the damned use that word in hell;</li>
  <li>Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,</li>
  <li class="number">Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,</li>
  <li>A sin-absolver, and my friend profess’d,</li>
  <li>To mangle me with that word ’banished’?</li>

<ol data-speaker="FRIAR LAURENCE">

  <li>Adversity’s sweet milk, philosophy,</li>
  <li>To comfort thee, though thou art banished.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ROMEO">
  <li>Yet ’banished’? Hang up philosophy!</li>
  <li>Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,</li>

  <li>Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,</li>

<ol data-speaker="CAPULET">
  <li>Things have fall’n out, sir, so unluckily,</li>
  <li>That we have had no time to move our daughter:</li>
  <li>Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,</li>
  <li>And so did I: — Well, we were born to die.</li>
  <li class="number">’Tis very late, she’ll not come down to-night:</li>
  <li>I promise you, but for your company,</li>
  <li>I would have been a-bed an hour ago.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PARIS">
  <li>These times of woe afford no time to woo.</li>
  <li>Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY CAPULET">
  <li class="number">I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;</li>
  <li>To-night she is mew’d up to her heaviness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAPULET">
  <li>Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender</li>
  <li>Of my child’s love: I think she will be ruled</li>
  <li>In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.</li>
  <li class="number">Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;</li>
  <li>Acquaint her here of my son Paris’ love;</li>
  <li>And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next — </li>
  <li>But, soft! what day is this?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PARIS">
  <li>Monday, my lord,</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAPULET">
  <li class="number">Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,</li>
  <li>O’ Thursday let it be: o’ Thursday, tell her,</li>
  <li>She shall be married to this noble earl.</li>
  <li>Will you be ready? do you like this haste?</li>
  <li>We’ll keep no great ado — a friend or two;</li>
  <li class="number">For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,</li>
  <li>It may be thought we held him carelessly,</li>
  <li>Being our kinsman, if we revel much:</li>
  <li>Therefore we’ll have some half a dozen friends,</li>
  <li>And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PARIS">

  <li>Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,</li>

  <li>Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter ROMEO and JULIET above, at the window</div>

<ol data-speaker="JULIET">
  <li>Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:</li>
  <li>It was the nightingale, and not the lark,</li>
  <li>That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;</li>
  <li>Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:</li>
  <li class="number">Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROMEO">
  <li>It was the lark, the herald of the morn,</li>
  <li>No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks</li>
  <li>Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:</li>
  <li>Night’s candles are burnt out, and jocund day</li>
  <li class="number">Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.</li>
  <li>I must be gone and live, or stay and die.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JULIET">
  <li>Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:</li>
  <li>It is some meteor that the sun exhales,</li>
  <li>To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,</li>
  <li class="number">And light thee on thy way to Mantua:</li>
  <li>Therefore stay yet; thou need’st not to be gone.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROMEO">
  <li>Let me be ta’en, let me be put to death;</li>
  <li>I am content, so thou wilt have it so.</li>
  <li>I’ll say yon grey is not the morning’s eye,</li>
  <li class="number">’Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia’s brow;</li>
  <li>Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat</li>
  <li>The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:</li>
  <li>I have more care to stay than will to go:</li>
  <li>Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.</li>
  <li class="number">How is’t, my soul? let’s talk; it is not day.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JULIET">
  <li>It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!</li>
  <li>It is the lark that sings so out of tune,</li>
  <li>Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.</li>
  <li>Some say the lark makes sweet division;</li>
  <li class="number">This doth not so, for she divideth us:</li>
  <li>Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,</li>
  <li>O, now I would they had changed voices too!</li>
  <li>Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,</li>
  <li>Hunting thee hence with hunt’s-up to the day,</li>
  <li class="number">O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.</li>

  <li>Evermore weeping for your cousin’s death?</li>
  <li>What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?</li>
  <li>An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;</li>
  <li>Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;</li>
  <li class="number">But much of grief shows still some want of wit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JULIET">
  <li>Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY CAPULET">
  <li>So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend</li>

<ol data-speaker="JULIET">
  <li>Feeling so the loss,</li>
  <li class="number">Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY CAPULET">
  <li>Well, girl, thou weep’st not so much for his death,</li>
  <li>As that the villain lives which slaughter’d him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JULIET">
  <li>What villain madam?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY CAPULET">
  <li>That same villain, Romeo.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JULIET">
  <li class="number"><span class="stage-direction">Aside</span>  Villain and he be many miles asunder. — </li>
  <li>God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;</li>

  <li>That is, because the traitor murderer lives.</li>

  <li>Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY CAPULET">
  <li>We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:</li>
  <li>Then weep no more. I’ll send to one in Mantua,</li>

  <li>Shall give him such an unaccustom’d dram,</li>
  <li class="number">That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JULIET">
  <li>Indeed, I never shall be satisfied</li>
  <li>With Romeo, till I behold him — dead — </li>
  <li>Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex’d.</li>
  <li class="number">Madam, if you could find out but a man</li>
  <li>To bear a poison, I would temper it;</li>
  <li>That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,</li>
  <li>Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors</li>
  <li>To hear him named, and cannot come to him.</li>
  <li class="number">To wreak the love I bore my cousin</li>
  <li>Upon his body that slaughter’d him!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY CAPULET">
  <li>Find thou the means, and I’ll find such a man.</li>

  <li>And joy comes well in such a needy time:</li>
  <li class="number">What are they, I beseech your ladyship?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY CAPULET">
  <li>Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;</li>
  <li>One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,</li>
  <li>Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,</li>
  <li>That thou expect’st not nor I look’d not for.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JULIET">

  <li>Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,</li>
  <li>The gallant, young and noble gentleman,</li>

  <li class="number">Now, by Saint Peter’s Church and Peter too,</li>
  <li>He shall not make me there a joyful bride.</li>
  <li>I wonder at this haste; that I must wed</li>
  <li>Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.</li>
  <li>I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,</li>
  <li class="number">I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,</li>
  <li>It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,</li>
  <li>Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!</li>

  <li>Come you to make confession to this father?</li>

  <li>To answer that, I should confess to you.</li>

  <li>So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.</li>

<ol data-speaker="JULIET">
  <li>If I do so, it will be of more price,</li>
  <li>Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PARIS">
  <li class="number">Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JULIET">
  <li>The tears have got small victory by that;</li>
  <li>For it was bad enough before their spite.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PARIS">
  <li>Thou wrong’st it, more than tears, with that report.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JULIET">
  <li>That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;</li>

  <li>Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander’d it.</li>

  <li>It may be so, for it is not mine own.</li>

<ol data-speaker="PARIS">
  <li>God shield I should disturb devotion!</li>
  <li>Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:</li>
  <li>Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<ol data-speaker="JULIET">
  <li class="number">O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FRIAR LAURENCE">
  <li>Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;</li>
  <li>It strains me past the compass of my wits:</li>
  <li>I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,</li>
  <li class="number">On Thursday next be married to this county.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JULIET">
  <li>Tell me not, friar, that thou hear’st of this,</li>
  <li>Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:</li>
  <li>If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,</li>
  <li>Do thou but call my resolution wise,</li>
  <li class="number">And with this knife I’ll help it presently.</li>
  <li>God join’d my heart and Romeo’s, thou our hands;</li>
  <li>And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal’d,</li>
  <li>Shall be the label to another deed,</li>
  <li>Or my true heart with treacherous revolt</li>
  <li class="number">Turn to another, this shall slay them both:</li>
  <li>Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,</li>
  <li>Give me some present counsel, or, behold,</li>
  <li>’Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife</li>
  <li>Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that</li>
  <li class="number">Which the commission of thy years and art</li>
  <li>Could to no issue of true honour bring.</li>
  <li>Be not so long to speak; I long to die,</li>
  <li>If what thou speak’st speak not of remedy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FRIAR LAURENCE">
  <li>Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,</li>
  <li class="number">Which craves as desperate an execution.</li>
  <li>As that is desperate which we would prevent.</li>
  <li>If, rather than to marry County Paris,</li>
  <li>Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,</li>
  <li>Then is it likely thou wilt undertake</li>
  <li class="number">A thing like death to chide away this shame,</li>
  <li>That copest with death himself to scape from it:</li>
  <li>And, if thou darest, I’ll give thee remedy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JULIET">
  <li>O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,</li>
  <li>From off the battlements of yonder tower;</li>
  <li class="number">Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk</li>
  <li>Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;</li>
  <li>Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,</li>
  <li>O’er-cover’d quite with dead men’s rattling bones,</li>
  <li>With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;</li>
  <li class="number">Or bid me go into a new-made grave</li>
  <li>And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;</li>
  <li>Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;</li>
  <li>And I will do it without fear or doubt,</li>
  <li>To live an unstain’d wife to my sweet love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FRIAR LAURENCE">
  <li class="number">Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent</li>
  <li>To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:</li>
  <li>To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;</li>
  <li>Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:</li>
  <li>Take thou this vial, being then in bed,</li>
  <li class="number">And this distilled liquor drink thou off;</li>
  <li>When presently through all thy veins shall run</li>
  <li>A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse</li>
  <li>Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:</li>
  <li>No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;</li>
  <li class="number">The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade</li>
  <li>To paly ashes, thy eyes’ windows fall,</li>
  <li>Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;</li>
  <li>Each part, deprived of supple government,</li>
  <li>Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:</li>
  <li class="number">And in this borrow’d likeness of shrunk death</li>
  <li>Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,</li>
  <li>And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.</li>
  <li>Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes</li>
  <li>To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:</li>
  <li class="number">Then, as the manner of our country is,</li>
  <li>In thy best robes uncover’d on the bier</li>
  <li>Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault</li>
  <li>Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.</li>
  <li>In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,</li>
  <li class="number">Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,</li>
  <li>And hither shall he come: and he and I</li>
  <li>Will watch thy waking, and that very night</li>
  <li>Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.</li>
  <li>And this shall free thee from this present shame;</li>
  <li class="number">If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,</li>
  <li>Abate thy valour in the acting it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JULIET">
  <li>Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FRIAR LAURENCE">
  <li>Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous</li>
  <li>In this resolve: I’ll send a friar with speed</li>

  <li>Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?</li>

  <li>Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:</li>
  <li class="number">And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,</li>
  <li>An alligator stuff’d, and other skins</li>
  <li>Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves</li>
  <li>A beggarly account of empty boxes,</li>
  <li>Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,</li>
  <li class="number">Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,</li>

  <li>Whose sale is present death in Mantua,</li>
  <li class="number">Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.’</li>
  <li>O, this same thought did but forerun my need;</li>
  <li>And this same needy man must sell it me.</li>
  <li>As I remember, this should be the house.</li>

<ol data-speaker="Apothecary">
  <li class="number">Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua’s law</li>

  <li class="number">Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;</li>
  <li>The world is not thy friend nor the world’s law;</li>
  <li>The world affords no law to make thee rich;</li>
  <li>Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.</li>

  <li class="number">I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.</li>

<ol data-speaker="Apothecary">
  <li>Put this in any liquid thing you will,</li>
  <li>And drink it off; and, if you had the strength</li>
  <li>Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROMEO">
  <li>There is thy gold, worse poison to men’s souls,</li>
  <li class="number">Doing more murders in this loathsome world,</li>

  <li>I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.</li>
  <li>Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.</li>

<ol data-speaker="FRIAR LAURENCE">
  <li>I will be brief, for my short date of breath</li>
  <li class="number">Is not so long as is a tedious tale.</li>
  <li>Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;</li>
  <li>And she, there dead, that Romeo’s faithful wife:</li>
  <li>I married them; and their stol’n marriage-day</li>
  <li>Was Tybalt’s dooms-day, whose untimely death</li>
  <li class="number">Banish’d the new-made bridegroom from the city,</li>
  <li>For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.</li>
  <li>You, to remove that siege of grief from her,</li>
  <li>Betroth’d and would have married her perforce</li>
  <li>To County Paris: then comes she to me,</li>
  <li class="number">And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean</li>
  <li>To rid her from this second marriage,</li>
  <li>Or in my cell there would she kill herself.</li>
  <li>Then gave I her, so tutor’d by my art,</li>
  <li>A sleeping potion; which so took effect</li>
  <li class="number">As I intended, for it wrought on her</li>
  <li>The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,</li>
  <li>That he should hither come as this dire night,</li>
  <li>To help to take her from her borrow’d grave,</li>
  <li>Being the time the potion’s force should cease.</li>
  <li class="number">But he which bore my letter, Friar John,</li>
  <li>Was stay’d by accident, and yesternight</li>
  <li>Return’d my letter back. Then all alone</li>
  <li>At the prefixed hour of her waking,</li>
  <li>Came I to take her from her kindred’s vault;</li>
  <li class="number">Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,</li>
  <li>Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:</li>
  <li>But when I came, some minute ere the time</li>
  <li>Of her awaking, here untimely lay</li>
  <li>The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.</li>
  <li class="number">She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,</li>
  <li>And bear this work of heaven with patience:</li>
  <li>But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;</li>
  <li>And she, too desperate, would not go with me,</li>
  <li>But, as it seems, did violence on herself.</li>
  <li class="number">All this I know; and to the marriage</li>
  <li>Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this</li>
  <li>Miscarried by my fault, let my old life</li>
  <li>Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,</li>
  <li>Unto the rigour of severest law.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE">
  <li class="number">We still have known thee for a holy man.</li>
  <li>Where’s Romeo’s man? what can he say in this?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BALTHASAR">
  <li>I brought my master news of Juliet’s death;</li>
  <li>And then in post he came from Mantua</li>
  <li>To this same place, to this same monument.</li>
  <li class="number">This letter he early bid me give his father,</li>
  <li>And threatened me with death, going in the vault,</li>
  <li>I departed not and left him there.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE">
  <li>Give me the letter; I will look on it.</li>
  <li>Where is the county’s page, that raised the watch?</li>
  <li class="number">Sirrah, what made your master in this place?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAGE">
  <li>He came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave;</li>
  <li>And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:</li>
  <li>Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;</li>
  <li>And by and by my master drew on him;</li>
  <li class="number">And then I ran away to call the watch.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE">
  <li>This letter doth make good the friar’s words,</li>
  <li>Their course of love, the tidings of her death:</li>
  <li>And here he writes that he did buy a poison</li>
  <li>Of a poor ’pothecary, and therewithal</li>
  <li class="number">Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.</li>
  <li>Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!</li>
  <li>See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,</li>
  <li>That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.</li>
  <li>And I for winking at your discords too</li>
  <li class="number">Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAPULET">
  <li>O brother Montague, give me thy hand:</li>
  <li>This is my daughter’s jointure, for no more</li>
  <li>Can I demand.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MONTAGUE">
  <li>But I can give thee more:</li>
  <li class="number">For I will raise her statue in pure gold;</li>
  <li>That while Verona by that name is known,</li>
  <li>There shall no figure at such rate be set</li>
  <li>As that of true and faithful Juliet.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAPULET">
  <li>As rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie;</li>
  <li class="number">Poor sacrifices of our enmity!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE">
  <li>A glooming peace this morning with it brings;</li>
  <li>The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:</li>
  <li>Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;</li>
  <li>Some shall be pardon’d, and some punished:</li>
  <li class="number">For never was a story of more woe</li>
  <li>Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.</li>
