<h3>SCENE I.  Antechamber in LEONTES’ palace.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter CAMILLO and ARCHIDAMUS</div>

<ol data-speaker="ARCHIDAMUS">
  <li>If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on</li>
  <li>the like occasion whereon my services are now on</li>
  <li>foot, you shall see, as I have said, great</li>
  <li>difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li class="number">I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia</li>
  <li>means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARCHIDAMUS">
  <li>Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be</li>
  <li>justified in our loves; for indeed — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li>Beseech you — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARCHIDAMUS">
  <li class="number">Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:</li>
  <li>we cannot with such magnificence — in so rare — I know</li>
  <li>not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks,</li>
  <li>that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,</li>
  <li>may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse</li>
  <li class="number">us.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li>You pay a great deal too dear for what’s given freely.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARCHIDAMUS">
  <li>Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me</li>
  <li>and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li>Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.</li>
  <li class="number">They were trained together in their childhoods; and</li>
  <li>there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,</li>
  <li>which cannot choose but branch now. Since their</li>
  <li>more mature dignities and royal necessities made</li>
  <li>separation of their society, their encounters,</li>
  <li class="number">though not personal, have been royally attorneyed</li>
  <li>with interchange of gifts, letters, loving</li>
  <li>embassies; that they have seemed to be together,</li>
  <li>though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and</li>
  <li>embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed</li>
  <li class="number">winds. The heavens continue their loves!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARCHIDAMUS">
  <li>I think there is not in the world either malice or</li>
  <li>matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable</li>
  <li>comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a</li>
  <li>gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came</li>
  <li class="number">into my note.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li>I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it</li>
  <li>is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the</li>
  <li>subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on</li>
  <li>crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to</li>
  <li class="number">see him a man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARCHIDAMUS">
  <li>Would they else be content to die?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li>Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should</li>
  <li>desire to live.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARCHIDAMUS">
  <li>If the king had no son, they would desire to live</li>
  <li class="number">on crutches till he had one.</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  A room of state in the same.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter LEONTES, HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS,
POLIXENES, CAMILLO, and Attendants</div>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li>Nine changes of the watery star hath been</li>
  <li>The shepherd’s note since we have left our throne</li>
  <li>Without a burthen: time as long again</li>
  <li>Would be find up, my brother, with our thanks;</li>
  <li class="number">And yet we should, for perpetuity,</li>
  <li>Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,</li>
  <li>Yet standing in rich place, I multiply</li>
  <li>With one ’We thank you’ many thousands moe</li>
  <li>That go before it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li class="number">Stay your thanks a while;</li>
  <li>And pay them when you part.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li>Sir, that’s to-morrow.</li>
  <li>I am question’d by my fears, of what may chance</li>
  <li>Or breed upon our absence; that may blow</li>
  <li class="number">No sneaping winds at home, to make us say</li>
  <li>’This is put forth too truly:’ besides, I have stay’d</li>
  <li>To tire your royalty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>We are tougher, brother,</li>
  <li>Than you can put us to’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li class="number">No longer stay.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>One seven-night longer.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li>Very sooth, to-morrow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>We’ll part the time between’s then; and in that</li>
  <li>I’ll no gainsaying.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li class="number">Press me not, beseech you, so.</li>
  <li>There is no tongue that moves, none, none i’ the world,</li>
  <li>So soon as yours could win me: so it should now,</li>
  <li>Were there necessity in your request, although</li>
  <li>’Twere needful I denied it. My affairs</li>
  <li class="number">Do even drag me homeward: which to hinder</li>
  <li>Were in your love a whip to me; my stay</li>
  <li>To you a charge and trouble: to save both,</li>
  <li>Farewell, our brother.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>Tongue-tied, our queen?</li>
  <li class="number">speak you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERMIONE">
  <li>I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until</li>
  <li>You have drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,</li>
  <li>Charge him too coldly. Tell him, you are sure</li>
  <li>All in Bohemia’s well; this satisfaction</li>
  <li class="number">The by-gone day proclaim’d: say this to him,</li>
  <li>He’s beat from his best ward.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>Well said, Hermione.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERMIONE">
  <li>To tell, he longs to see his son, were strong:</li>
  <li>But let him say so then, and let him go;</li>
  <li class="number">But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,</li>
  <li>We’ll thwack him hence with distaffs.</li>
  <li>Yet of your royal presence I’ll adventure</li>
  <li>The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia</li>
  <li>You take my lord, I’ll give him my commission</li>
  <li class="number">To let him there a month behind the gest</li>
  <li>Prefix’d for’s parting: yet, good deed, Leontes,</li>
  <li>I love thee not a jar o’ the clock behind</li>
  <li>What lady-she her lord. You’ll stay?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li>No, madam.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERMIONE">
  <li class="number">Nay, but you will?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li>I may not, verily.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERMIONE">
  <li>Verily!</li>
  <li>You put me off with limber vows; but I,</li>
  <li>Though you would seek to unsphere the</li>
  <li class="number">stars with oaths,</li>
  <li>Should yet say ’Sir, no going.’ Verily,</li>
  <li>You shall not go: a lady’s ’Verily’ ’s</li>
  <li>As potent as a lord’s. Will you go yet?</li>
  <li>Force me to keep you as a prisoner,</li>
  <li class="number">Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees</li>
  <li>When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?</li>
  <li>My prisoner? or my guest? by your dread ’Verily,’</li>
  <li>One of them you shall be.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li>Your guest, then, madam:</li>
  <li class="number">To be your prisoner should import offending;</li>
  <li>Which is for me less easy to commit</li>
  <li>Than you to punish.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERMIONE">
  <li>Not your gaoler, then,</li>
  <li>But your kind hostess. Come, I’ll question you</li>
  <li class="number">Of my lord’s tricks and yours when you were boys:</li>
  <li>You were pretty lordings then?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li>We were, fair queen,</li>
  <li>Two lads that thought there was no more behind</li>
  <li>But such a day to-morrow as to-day,</li>
  <li class="number">And to be boy eternal.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERMIONE">
  <li>Was not my lord</li>
  <li>The verier wag o’ the two?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li>We were as twinn’d lambs that did frisk i’ the sun,</li>
  <li>And bleat the one at the other: what we changed</li>
  <li class="number">Was innocence for innocence; we knew not</li>
  <li>The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream’d</li>
  <li>That any did. Had we pursued that life,</li>
  <li>And our weak spirits ne’er been higher rear’d</li>
  <li>With stronger blood, we should have answer’d heaven</li>
  <li class="number">Boldly ’not guilty;’ the imposition clear’d</li>
  <li>Hereditary ours.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERMIONE">
  <li>By this we gather</li>
  <li>You have tripp’d since.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li>O my most sacred lady!</li>
  <li class="number">Temptations have since then been born to’s; for</li>
  <li>In those unfledged days was my wife a girl;</li>
  <li>Your precious self had then not cross’d the eyes</li>
  <li>Of my young play-fellow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERMIONE">
  <li>Grace to boot!</li>
  <li class="number">Of this make no conclusion, lest you say</li>
  <li>Your queen and I are devils: yet go on;</li>
  <li>The offences we have made you do we’ll answer,</li>
  <li>If you first sinn’d with us and that with us</li>
  <li>You did continue fault and that you slipp’d not</li>
  <li class="number">With any but with us.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>Is he won yet?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERMIONE">
  <li>He’ll stay my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>At my request he would not.</li>
  <li>Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokest</li>
  <li class="number">To better purpose.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERMIONE">
  <li>Never?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>Never, but once.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERMIONE">
  <li>What! have I twice said well? when was’t before?</li>
  <li>I prithee tell me; cram’s with praise, and make’s</li>
  <li class="number">As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless</li>
  <li>Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.</li>
  <li>Our praises are our wages: you may ride’s</li>
  <li>With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere</li>
  <li>With spur we beat an acre. But to the goal:</li>
  <li class="number">My last good deed was to entreat his stay:</li>
  <li>What was my first? it has an elder sister,</li>
  <li>Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!</li>
  <li>But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?</li>
  <li>Nay, let me have’t; I long.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li class="number">Why, that was when</li>
  <li>Three crabbed months had sour’d themselves to death,</li>
  <li>Ere I could make thee open thy white hand</li>
  <li>And clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter</li>
  <li>’I am yours for ever.’</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERMIONE">
  <li class="number">’Tis grace indeed.</li>
  <li>Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:</li>
  <li>The one for ever earn’d a royal husband;</li>
  <li>The other for some while a friend.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li><span class="stage-direction">Aside</span> Too hot, too hot!</li>
  <li class="number">To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.</li>
  <li>I have tremor cordis on me: my heart dances;</li>
  <li>But not for joy; not joy. This entertainment</li>
  <li>May a free face put on, derive a liberty</li>
  <li>From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,</li>
  <li class="number">And well become the agent; ’t may, I grant;</li>
  <li>But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,</li>
  <li>As now they are, and making practised smiles,</li>
  <li>As in a looking-glass, and then to sigh, as ’twere</li>
  <li>The mort o’ the deer; O, that is entertainment</li>
  <li class="number">My bosom likes not, nor my brows! Mamillius,</li>
  <li>Art thou my boy?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAMILLIUS">
  <li>Ay, my good lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>I’ fecks!</li>
  <li>Why, that’s my bawcock. What, hast</li>
  <li class="number">smutch’d thy nose?</li>
  <li>They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,</li>
  <li>We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:</li>
  <li>And yet the steer, the heifer and the calf</li>
  <li>Are all call’d neat. — Still virginalling</li>
  <li class="number">Upon his palm! — How now, you wanton calf!</li>
  <li>Art thou my calf?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAMILLIUS">
  <li>Yes, if you will, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>Thou want’st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,</li>
  <li>To be full like me: yet they say we are</li>
  <li class="number">Almost as like as eggs; women say so,</li>
  <li>That will say anything but were they false</li>
  <li>As o’er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false</li>
  <li>As dice are to be wish’d by one that fixes</li>
  <li>No bourn ’twixt his and mine, yet were it true</li>
  <li class="number">To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,</li>
  <li>Look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!</li>
  <li>Most dear’st! my collop! Can thy dam? — may’t be? — </li>
  <li>Affection! thy intention stabs the centre:</li>
  <li>Thou dost make possible things not so held,</li>
  <li class="number">Communicatest with dreams; — how can this be? — </li>
  <li>With what’s unreal thou coactive art,</li>
  <li>And fellow’st nothing: then ’tis very credent</li>
  <li>Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,</li>
  <li>And that beyond commission, and I find it,</li>
  <li class="number">And that to the infection of my brains</li>
  <li>And hardening of my brows.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li>What means Sicilia?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERMIONE">
  <li>He something seems unsettled.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li>How, my lord!</li>
  <li class="number">What cheer? how is’t with you, best brother?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERMIONE">
  <li>You look as if you held a brow of much distraction</li>
  <li>Are you moved, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>No, in good earnest.</li>
  <li>How sometimes nature will betray its folly,</li>
  <li class="number">Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime</li>
  <li>To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines</li>
  <li>Of my boy’s face, methoughts I did recoil</li>
  <li>Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech’d,</li>
  <li>In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,</li>
  <li class="number">Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,</li>
  <li>As ornaments oft do, too dangerous:</li>
  <li>How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,</li>
  <li>This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,</li>
  <li>Will you take eggs for money?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAMILLIUS">
  <li class="number">No, my lord, I’ll fight.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>You will! why, happy man be’s dole! My brother,</li>
  <li>Are you so fond of your young prince as we</li>
  <li>Do seem to be of ours?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li>If at home, sir,</li>
  <li class="number">He’s all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,</li>
  <li>Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,</li>
  <li>My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:</li>
  <li>He makes a July’s day short as December,</li>
  <li>And with his varying childness cures in me</li>
  <li class="number">Thoughts that would thick my blood.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>So stands this squire</li>
  <li>Officed with me: we two will walk, my lord,</li>
  <li>And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,</li>
  <li>How thou lovest us, show in our brother’s welcome;</li>
  <li class="number">Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:</li>
  <li>Next to thyself and my young rover, he’s</li>
  <li>Apparent to my heart.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERMIONE">
  <li>If you would seek us,</li>
  <li>We are yours i’ the garden: shall’s attend you there?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li class="number">To your own bents dispose you: you’ll be found,</li>
  <li>Be you beneath the sky.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Aside</li>
  <li>I am angling now,</li>
  <li>Though you perceive me not how I give line.</li>
  <li>Go to, go to!</li>
  <li class="number">How she holds up the neb, the bill to him!</li>
  <li>And arms her with the boldness of a wife</li>
  <li>To her allowing husband!</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exeunt POLIXENES, HERMIONE, and Attendants</li>
  <li>Gone already!</li>
  <li>Inch-thick, knee-deep, o’er head and</li>
  <li class="number">ears a fork’d one!</li>
  <li>Go, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and I</li>
  <li>Play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue</li>
  <li>Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour</li>
  <li>Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play.</li>
  <li class="number">There have been,</li>
  <li>Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;</li>
  <li>And many a man there is, even at this present,</li>
  <li>Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,</li>
  <li>That little thinks she has been sluiced in’s absence</li>
  <li class="number">And his pond fish’d by his next neighbour, by</li>
  <li>Sir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there’s comfort in’t</li>
  <li>Whiles other men have gates and those gates open’d,</li>
  <li>As mine, against their will. Should all despair</li>
  <li>That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind</li>
  <li class="number">Would hang themselves. Physic for’t there is none;</li>
  <li>It is a bawdy planet, that will strike</li>
  <li>Where ’tis predominant; and ’tis powerful, think it,</li>
  <li>From east, west, north and south: be it concluded,</li>
  <li>No barricado for a belly; know’t;</li>
  <li class="number">It will let in and out the enemy</li>
  <li>With bag and baggage: many thousand on’s</li>
  <li>Have the disease, and feel’t not. How now, boy!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAMILLIUS">
  <li>I am like you, they say.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>Why that’s some comfort. What, Camillo there?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li class="number">Ay, my good lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>Go play, Mamillius; thou’rt an honest man.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exit MAMILLIUS</li>
  <li>Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li>You had much ado to make his anchor hold:</li>
  <li>When you cast out, it still came home.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li class="number">Didst note it?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li>He would not stay at your petitions: made</li>
  <li>His business more material.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>Didst perceive it?</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Aside</li>
  <li>They’re here with me already, whispering, rounding</li>
  <li class="number">’Sicilia is a so-forth:’ ’tis far gone,</li>

  <li>That he did stay?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li>At the good queen’s entreaty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>At the queen’s be’t: ’good’ should be pertinent</li>
  <li class="number">But, so it is, it is not. Was this taken</li>
  <li>By any understanding pate but thine?</li>
  <li>For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in</li>
  <li>More than the common blocks: not noted, is’t,</li>
  <li>But of the finer natures? by some severals</li>
  <li class="number">Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes</li>
  <li>Perchance are to this business purblind? say.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li>Business, my lord! I think most understand</li>
  <li>Bohemia stays here longer.</li>

  <li>Ha!</li>

  <li>To satisfy your highness and the entreaties</li>
  <li>Of our most gracious mistress.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>Satisfy!</li>
  <li class="number">The entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!</li>
  <li>Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,</li>
  <li>With all the nearest things to my heart, as well</li>
  <li>My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou</li>
  <li>Hast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departed</li>
  <li class="number">Thy penitent reform’d: but we have been</li>
  <li>Deceived in thy integrity, deceived</li>
  <li>In that which seems so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li>Be it forbid, my lord!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>To bide upon’t, thou art not honest, or,</li>
  <li class="number">If thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward,</li>
  <li>Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining</li>
  <li>From course required; or else thou must be counted</li>
  <li>A servant grafted in my serious trust</li>
  <li>And therein negligent; or else a fool</li>
  <li class="number">That seest a game play’d home, the rich stake drawn,</li>
  <li>And takest it all for jest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li>My gracious lord,</li>
  <li>I may be negligent, foolish and fearful;</li>
  <li>In every one of these no man is free,</li>
  <li class="number">But that his negligence, his folly, fear,</li>
  <li>Among the infinite doings of the world,</li>
  <li>Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,</li>
  <li>If ever I were wilful-negligent,</li>
  <li>It was my folly; if industriously</li>
  <li class="number">I play’d the fool, it was my negligence,</li>
  <li>Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful</li>
  <li>To do a thing, where I the issue doubted,</li>
  <li>Where of the execution did cry out</li>
  <li>Against the non-performance, ’twas a fear</li>
  <li class="number">Which oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,</li>
  <li>Are such allow’d infirmities that honesty</li>
  <li>Is never free of. But, beseech your grace,</li>
  <li>Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass</li>
  <li>By its own visage: if I then deny it,</li>
  <li class="number">’Tis none of mine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>Ha’ not you seen, Camillo — </li>
  <li>But that’s past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass</li>
  <li>Is thicker than a cuckold’s horn — or heard — </li>
  <li>For to a vision so apparent rumour</li>
  <li class="number">Cannot be mute — or thought — for cogitation</li>
  <li>Resides not in that man that does not think — </li>
  <li>My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,</li>
  <li>Or else be impudently negative,</li>
  <li>To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say</li>
  <li class="number">My wife’s a hobby-horse, deserves a name</li>
  <li>As rank as any flax-wench that puts to</li>
  <li>Before her troth-plight: say’t and justify’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li>I would not be a stander-by to hear</li>
  <li>My sovereign mistress clouded so, without</li>
  <li class="number">My present vengeance taken: ’shrew my heart,</li>
  <li>You never spoke what did become you less</li>
  <li>Than this; which to reiterate were sin</li>
  <li>As deep as that, though true.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>Is whispering nothing?</li>
  <li class="number">Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?</li>
  <li>Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career</li>
  <li>Of laughing with a sigh? — a note infallible</li>
  <li>Of breaking honesty — horsing foot on foot?</li>
  <li>Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?</li>
  <li class="number">Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes</li>
  <li>Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,</li>
  <li>That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?</li>
  <li>Why, then the world and all that’s in’t is nothing;</li>
  <li>The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing;</li>
  <li class="number">My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings,</li>
  <li>If this be nothing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li>Good my lord, be cured</li>
  <li>Of this diseased opinion, and betimes;</li>
  <li>For ’tis most dangerous.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li class="number">Say it be, ’tis true.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li>No, no, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>It is; you lie, you lie:</li>
  <li>I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,</li>
  <li>Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,</li>
  <li class="number">Or else a hovering temporizer, that</li>
  <li>Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,</li>
  <li>Inclining to them both: were my wife’s liver</li>
  <li>Infected as her life, she would not live</li>
  <li>The running of one glass.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li class="number">Who does infect her?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>Why, he that wears her like a medal, hanging</li>
  <li>About his neck, Bohemia: who, if I</li>
  <li>Had servants true about me, that bare eyes</li>
  <li>To see alike mine honour as their profits,</li>
  <li class="number">Their own particular thrifts, they would do that</li>
  <li>Which should undo more doing: ay, and thou,</li>
  <li>His cupbearer — whom I from meaner form</li>
  <li>Have benched and reared to worship, who mayst see</li>
  <li>Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,</li>
  <li class="number">How I am galled — mightst bespice a cup,</li>
  <li>To give mine enemy a lasting wink;</li>
  <li>Which draught to me were cordial.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li>Sir, my lord,</li>
  <li>I could do this, and that with no rash potion,</li>
  <li class="number">But with a lingering dram that should not work</li>
  <li>Maliciously like poison: but I cannot</li>
  <li>Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,</li>
  <li>So sovereignly being honourable.</li>
  <li>I have loved thee — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li class="number">Make that thy question, and go rot!</li>
  <li>Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,</li>
  <li>To appoint myself in this vexation, sully</li>
  <li>The purity and whiteness of my sheets,</li>
  <li>Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted</li>
  <li class="number">Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps,</li>
  <li>Give scandal to the blood o’ the prince my son,</li>
  <li>Who I do think is mine and love as mine,</li>
  <li>Without ripe moving to’t? Would I do this?</li>
  <li>Could man so blench?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li class="number">I must believe you, sir:</li>
  <li>I do; and will fetch off Bohemia for’t;</li>
  <li>Provided that, when he’s removed, your highness</li>
  <li>Will take again your queen as yours at first,</li>
  <li>Even for your son’s sake; and thereby for sealing</li>
  <li class="number">The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms</li>
  <li>Known and allied to yours.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>Thou dost advise me</li>
  <li>Even so as I mine own course have set down:</li>
  <li>I’ll give no blemish to her honour, none.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li class="number">My lord,</li>
  <li>Go then; and with a countenance as clear</li>
  <li>As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia</li>
  <li>And with your queen. I am his cupbearer:</li>
  <li>If from me he have wholesome beverage,</li>
  <li class="number">Account me not your servant.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>This is all:</li>
  <li>Do’t and thou hast the one half of my heart;</li>
  <li>Do’t not, thou split’st thine own.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li>I’ll do’t, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li class="number">I will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li>O miserable lady! But, for me,</li>
  <li>What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner</li>
  <li>Of good Polixenes; and my ground to do’t</li>
  <li>Is the obedience to a master, one</li>
  <li class="number">Who in rebellion with himself will have</li>
  <li>All that are his so too. To do this deed,</li>
  <li>Promotion follows. If I could find example</li>

  <li>And flourish’d after, I’ld not do’t; but since</li>
  <li class="number">Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,</li>
  <li>Let villany itself forswear’t. I must</li>
  <li>Forsake the court: to do’t, or no, is certain</li>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li class="number">This is strange: methinks</li>
  <li>My favour here begins to warp. Not speak?</li>
  <li>Good day, Camillo.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li>Hail, most royal sir!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li>What is the news i’ the court?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li class="number">None rare, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li>The king hath on him such a countenance</li>
  <li>As he had lost some province and a region</li>
  <li>Loved as he loves himself: even now I met him</li>
  <li>With customary compliment; when he,</li>
  <li class="number">Wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling</li>
  <li>A lip of much contempt, speeds from me and</li>
  <li>So leaves me to consider what is breeding</li>
  <li>That changeth thus his manners.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li>I dare not know, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li class="number">How! dare not! do not. Do you know, and dare not?</li>
  <li>Be intelligent to me: ’tis thereabouts;</li>
  <li>For, to yourself, what you do know, you must.</li>
  <li>And cannot say, you dare not. Good Camillo,</li>
  <li>Your changed complexions are to me a mirror</li>
  <li class="number">Which shows me mine changed too; for I must be</li>
  <li>A party in this alteration, finding</li>
  <li>Myself thus alter’d with ’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li>There is a sickness</li>
  <li>Which puts some of us in distemper, but</li>
  <li class="number">I cannot name the disease; and it is caught</li>
  <li>Of you that yet are well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li>How! caught of me!</li>
  <li>Make me not sighted like the basilisk:</li>
  <li>I have look’d on thousands, who have sped the better</li>
  <li class="number">By my regard, but kill’d none so. Camillo — </li>
  <li>As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto</li>
  <li>Clerk-like experienced, which no less adorns</li>
  <li>Our gentry than our parents’ noble names,</li>
  <li>In whose success we are gentle — I beseech you,</li>
  <li class="number">If you know aught which does behove my knowledge</li>
  <li>Thereof to be inform’d, imprison’t not</li>
  <li>In ignorant concealment.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li>I may not answer.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li>A sickness caught of me, and yet I well!</li>
  <li class="number">I must be answer’d. Dost thou hear, Camillo,</li>
  <li>I conjure thee, by all the parts of man</li>
  <li>Which honour does acknowledge, whereof the least</li>
  <li>Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare</li>
  <li>What incidency thou dost guess of harm</li>
  <li class="number">Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near;</li>
  <li>Which way to be prevented, if to be;</li>
  <li>If not, how best to bear it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li>Sir, I will tell you;</li>
  <li>Since I am charged in honour and by him</li>
  <li class="number">That I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel,</li>
  <li>Which must be even as swiftly follow’d as</li>
  <li>I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me</li>
  <li>Cry lost, and so good night!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li>On, good Camillo.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li class="number">I am appointed him to murder you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li>By whom, Camillo?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li>By the king.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li>For what?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li>He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,</li>
  <li class="number">As he had seen’t or been an instrument</li>
  <li>To vice you to’t, that you have touch’d his queen</li>
  <li>Forbiddenly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li>O, then my best blood turn</li>
  <li>To an infected jelly and my name</li>
  <li class="number">Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!</li>
  <li>Turn then my freshest reputation to</li>
  <li>A savour that may strike the dullest nostril</li>
  <li>Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn’d,</li>
  <li>Nay, hated too, worse than the great’st infection</li>
  <li class="number">That e’er was heard or read!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li>Swear his thought over</li>
  <li>By each particular star in heaven and</li>
  <li>By all their influences, you may as well</li>
  <li>Forbid the sea for to obey the moon</li>
  <li class="number">As or by oath remove or counsel shake</li>
  <li>The fabric of his folly, whose foundation</li>
  <li>Is piled upon his faith and will continue</li>
  <li>The standing of his body.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li>How should this grow?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li class="number">I know not: but I am sure ’tis safer to</li>
  <li>Avoid what’s grown than question how ’tis born.</li>
  <li>If therefore you dare trust my honesty,</li>
  <li>That lies enclosed in this trunk which you</li>
  <li>Shall bear along impawn’d, away to-night!</li>
  <li class="number">Your followers I will whisper to the business,</li>
  <li>And will by twos and threes at several posterns</li>
  <li>Clear them o’ the city. For myself, I’ll put</li>
  <li>My fortunes to your service, which are here</li>
  <li>By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain;</li>
  <li class="number">For, by the honour of my parents, I</li>
  <li>Have utter’d truth: which if you seek to prove,</li>
  <li>I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer</li>
  <li>Than one condemn’d by the king’s own mouth, thereon</li>
  <li>His execution sworn.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li class="number">I do believe thee:</li>
  <li>I saw his heart in ’s face. Give me thy hand:</li>
  <li>Be pilot to me and thy places shall</li>
  <li>Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready and</li>
  <li>My people did expect my hence departure</li>
  <li class="number">Two days ago. This jealousy</li>
  <li>Is for a precious creature: as she’s rare,</li>
  <li>Must it be great, and as his person’s mighty,</li>
  <li>Must it be violent, and as he does conceive</li>
  <li>He is dishonour’d by a man which ever</li>
  <li class="number">Profess’d to him, why, his revenges must</li>
  <li>In that be made more bitter. Fear o’ershades me:</li>
  <li>Good expedition be my friend, and comfort</li>
  <li>The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing</li>
  <li>Of his ill-ta’en suspicion! Come, Camillo;</li>
  <li class="number">I will respect thee as a father if</li>
  <li>Thou bear’st my life off hence: let us avoid.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li>It is in mine authority to command</li>
  <li>The keys of all the posterns: please your highness</li>
  <li>To take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away.</li>

<ol data-speaker="HERMIONE">
  <li>Take the boy to you: he so troubles me,</li>
  <li>’Tis past enduring.</li>

<ol data-speaker="First Lady">
  <li>Come, my gracious lord,</li>
  <li>Shall I be your playfellow?</li>

  <li>Why, my sweet lord?</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Lady">
  <li>And why so, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAMILLIUS">
  <li class="number">Not for because</li>
  <li>Your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,</li>
  <li>Become some women best, so that there be not</li>
  <li>Too much hair there, but in a semicircle</li>
  <li>Or a half-moon made with a pen.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Lady">
  <li class="number">Who taught you this?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAMILLIUS">
  <li>I learnt it out of women’s faces. Pray now</li>
  <li>What colour are your eyebrows?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Lady">
  <li>Blue, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAMILLIUS">
  <li>Nay, that’s a mock: I have seen a lady’s nose</li>
  <li class="number">That has been blue, but not her eyebrows.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Lady">
  <li>Hark ye;</li>
  <li>The queen your mother rounds apace: we shall</li>

  <li>One of these days; and then you’ld wanton with us,</li>

  <li>She is spread of late</li>

  <li>I am for you again: pray you, sit by us,</li>

<ol data-speaker="MAMILLIUS">
  <li>Merry or sad shall’t be?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERMIONE">
  <li>As merry as you will.</li>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Lord">
  <li class="number">Behind the tuft of pines I met them; never</li>
  <li>Saw I men scour so on their way: I eyed them</li>
  <li>Even to their ships.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>How blest am I</li>
  <li>In my just censure, in my true opinion!</li>
  <li class="number">Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed</li>
  <li>In being so blest! There may be in the cup</li>
  <li>A spider steep’d, and one may drink, depart,</li>
  <li>And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge</li>
  <li>Is not infected: but if one present</li>
  <li class="number">The abhorr’d ingredient to his eye, make known</li>
  <li>How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,</li>
  <li>With violent hefts. I have drunk,</li>
  <li>and seen the spider.</li>
  <li>Camillo was his help in this, his pander:</li>
  <li class="number">There is a plot against my life, my crown;</li>
  <li>All’s true that is mistrusted: that false villain</li>
  <li>Whom I employ’d was pre-employ’d by him:</li>
  <li>He has discover’d my design, and I</li>
  <li>Remain a pinch’d thing; yea, a very trick</li>
  <li class="number">For them to play at will. How came the posterns</li>
  <li>So easily open?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Lord">
  <li>By his great authority;</li>
  <li>Which often hath no less prevail’d than so</li>
  <li>On your command.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li class="number">I know’t too well.</li>
  <li>Give me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:</li>
  <li>Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you</li>
  <li>Have too much blood in him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERMIONE">
  <li>What is this? sport?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li class="number">Bear the boy hence; he shall not come about her;</li>
  <li>Away with him! and let her sport herself</li>
  <li>With that she’s big with; for ’tis Polixenes</li>
  <li>Has made thee swell thus.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERMIONE">
  <li>But I’ld say he had not,</li>
  <li class="number">And I’ll be sworn you would believe my saying,</li>
  <li>Howe’er you lean to the nayward.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>You, my lords,</li>
  <li>Look on her, mark her well; be but about</li>
  <li>To say ’she is a goodly lady,’ and</li>
  <li class="number">The justice of your bearts will thereto add</li>
  <li>’Tis pity she’s not honest, honourable:’</li>
  <li>Praise her but for this her without-door form,</li>
  <li>Which on my faith deserves high speech, and straight</li>
  <li>The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands</li>
  <li class="number">That calumny doth use — O, I am out — </li>
  <li>That mercy does, for calumny will sear</li>
  <li>Virtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha’s,</li>
  <li>When you have said ’she’s goodly,’ come between</li>
  <li>Ere you can say ’she’s honest:’ but be ’t known,</li>
  <li class="number">From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,</li>
  <li>She’s an adulteress.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERMIONE">
  <li>Should a villain say so,</li>

  <li>Why, what need we</li>

  <li>Imparts this; which if you, or stupefied</li>
  <li>Or seeming so in skill, cannot or will not</li>
  <li>Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves</li>
  <li class="number">We need no more of your advice: the matter,</li>

  <li>And I wish, my liege,</li>
  <li>You had only in your silent judgment tried it,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>How could that be?</li>
  <li>Either thou art most ignorant by age,</li>
  <li>Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo’s flight,</li>

  <li class="number">Which was as gross as ever touch’d conjecture,</li>
  <li>That lack’d sight only, nought for approbation</li>
  <li>But only seeing, all other circumstances</li>
  <li>Made up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding:</li>
  <li>Yet, for a greater confirmation,</li>
  <li class="number">For in an act of this importance ’twere</li>
  <li>Most piteous to be wild, I have dispatch’d in post</li>
  <li>To sacred Delphos, to Apollo’s temple,</li>
  <li>Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know</li>
  <li>Of stuff’d sufficiency: now from the oracle</li>
  <li class="number">They will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had,</li>
  <li>Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Lord">
  <li>Well done, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>Though I am satisfied and need no more</li>
  <li>Than what I know, yet shall the oracle</li>
  <li class="number">Give rest to the minds of others, such as he</li>
  <li>Whose ignorant credulity will not</li>
  <li>Come up to the truth. So have we thought it good</li>
  <li>From our free person she should be confined,</li>
  <li>Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence</li>

  <li>Leontes, king of Sicilia, thou art here accused and</li>
  <li>arraigned of high treason, in committing adultery</li>
  <li class="number">with Polixenes, king of Bohemia, and conspiring</li>
  <li>with Camillo to take away the life of our sovereign</li>

  <li>whereof being by circumstances partly laid open,</li>
  <li>thou, Hermione, contrary to the faith and allegiance</li>

  <li>Since what I am to say must be but that</li>
  <li>Which contradicts my accusation and</li>

  <li class="number">But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me</li>
  <li>To say ’not guilty:’ mine integrity</li>
  <li>Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,</li>
  <li>Be so received. But thus: if powers divine</li>
  <li>Behold our human actions, as they do,</li>

  <li>As I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honour,</li>
  <li>’Tis a derivative from me to mine,</li>
  <li class="number">And only that I stand for. I appeal</li>
  <li>To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes</li>
  <li>Came to your court, how I was in your grace,</li>
  <li>How merited to be so; since he came,</li>
  <li>With what encounter so uncurrent I</li>
  <li class="number">Have strain’d to appear thus: if one jot beyond</li>
  <li>The bound of honour, or in act or will</li>
  <li>That way inclining, harden’d be the hearts</li>

  <li>I loved him as in honour he required,</li>
  <li>With such a kind of love as might become</li>

  <li>I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li>It is fifteen years since I saw my country: though</li>
  <li class="number">I have for the most part been aired abroad, I</li>
  <li>desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent</li>
  <li>king, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling</li>
  <li>sorrows I might be some allay, or I o’erween to</li>
  <li>think so, which is another spur to my departure.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li class="number">As thou lovest me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of</li>
  <li>thy services by leaving me now: the need I have of</li>
  <li>thee thine own goodness hath made; better not to</li>
  <li>have had thee than thus to want thee: thou, having</li>

  <li>services thou hast done; which if I have not enough</li>
  <li>considered, as too much I cannot, to be more</li>
  <li>thankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit</li>
  <li class="number">therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal</li>
  <li>country, Sicilia, prithee speak no more; whose very</li>
  <li>naming punishes me with the remembrance of that</li>
  <li>penitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king,</li>
  <li>my brother; whose loss of his most precious queen</li>
  <li class="number">and children are even now to be afresh lamented.</li>
  <li>Say to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, my</li>

  <li>from court and is less frequent to his princely</li>
  <li>exercises than formerly he hath appeared.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li class="number">I have considered so much, Camillo, and with some</li>

  <li>troll-my-dames; I knew him once a servant of the</li>
  <li>prince: I cannot tell, good sir, for which of his</li>
  <li>virtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of the court.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Clown">
  <li class="number">His vices, you would say; there’s no virtue whipped</li>
  <li>out of the court: they cherish it to make it stay</li>
  <li>there; and yet it will no more but abide.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUTOLYCUS">
  <li>Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man well: he</li>
  <li>hath been since an ape-bearer; then a</li>
  <li class="number">process-server, a bailiff; then he compassed a</li>
  <li>motion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker’s</li>
  <li>wife within a mile where my land and living lies;</li>
  <li>and, having flown over many knavish professions, he</li>
  <li>settled only in rogue: some call him Autolycus.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Clown">
  <li class="number">Out upon him! prig, for my life, prig: he haunts</li>
  <li>wakes, fairs and bear-baitings.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUTOLYCUS">
  <li>Very true, sir; he, sir, he; that’s the rogue that</li>
  <li>put me into this apparel.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Clown">
  <li>Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia: if you had</li>
  <li class="number">but looked big and spit at him, he’ld have run.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUTOLYCUS">
  <li>I must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter: I am</li>
  <li>false of heart that way; and that he knew, I warrant</li>
  <li>him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Clown">
  <li>How do you now?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUTOLYCUS">
  <li class="number">Sweet sir, much better than I was; I can stand and</li>
  <li>walk: I will even take my leave of you, and pace</li>
  <li>softly towards my kinsman’s.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Clown">
  <li>Shall I bring thee on the way?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUTOLYCUS">
  <li>No, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Clown">
  <li class="number">Then fare thee well: I must go buy spices for our</li>
  <li>sheep-shearing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUTOLYCUS">
  <li>Prosper you, sweet sir!</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exit Clown</li>
  <li>Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice.</li>
  <li>I’ll be with you at your sheep-shearing too: if I</li>

  <li>shearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled and my name</li>
  <li>put in the book of virtue!</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Sings</li>
  <li>Jog on, jog on, the foot-path way,</li>

<h3>SCENE IV.  The Shepherd’s cottage.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter FLORIZEL and PERDITA</div>

<ol data-speaker="FLORIZEL">
  <li>These your unusual weeds to each part of you</li>
  <li>Do give a life: no shepherdess, but Flora</li>
  <li>Peering in April’s front. This your sheep-shearing</li>
  <li>Is as a meeting of the petty gods,</li>
  <li class="number">And you the queen on’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PERDITA">
  <li>Sir, my gracious lord,</li>
  <li>To chide at your extremes it not becomes me:</li>
  <li>O, pardon, that I name them! Your high self,</li>
  <li>The gracious mark o’ the land, you have obscured</li>
  <li class="number">With a swain’s wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,</li>
  <li>Most goddess-like prank’d up: but that our feasts</li>
  <li>In every mess have folly and the feeders</li>
  <li>Digest it with a custom, I should blush</li>
  <li>To see you so attired, sworn, I think,</li>
  <li class="number">To show myself a glass.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLORIZEL">
  <li>I bless the time</li>
  <li>When my good falcon made her flight across</li>
  <li>Thy father’s ground.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PERDITA">
  <li>Now Jove afford you cause!</li>
  <li class="number">To me the difference forges dread; your greatness</li>
  <li>Hath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble</li>
  <li>To think your father, by some accident,</li>
  <li>Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!</li>
  <li>How would he look, to see his work so noble</li>
  <li class="number">Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how</li>
  <li>Should I, in these my borrow’d flaunts, behold</li>
  <li>The sternness of his presence?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLORIZEL">
  <li>Apprehend</li>
  <li>Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,</li>
  <li class="number">Humbling their deities to love, have taken</li>
  <li>The shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter</li>
  <li>Became a bull, and bellow’d; the green Neptune</li>
  <li>A ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god,</li>
  <li>Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,</li>
  <li class="number">As I seem now. Their transformations</li>
  <li>Were never for a piece of beauty rarer,</li>
  <li>Nor in a way so chaste, since my desires</li>
  <li>Run not before mine honour, nor my lusts</li>
  <li>Burn hotter than my faith.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PERDITA">
  <li class="number">O, but, sir,</li>
  <li>Your resolution cannot hold, when ’tis</li>
  <li>Opposed, as it must be, by the power of the king:</li>
  <li>One of these two must be necessities,</li>
  <li>Which then will speak, that you must</li>
  <li class="number">change this purpose,</li>
  <li>Or I my life.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLORIZEL">
  <li>Thou dearest Perdita,</li>
  <li>With these forced thoughts, I prithee, darken not</li>
  <li>The mirth o’ the feast. Or I’ll be thine, my fair,</li>
  <li class="number">Or not my father’s. For I cannot be</li>
  <li>Mine own, nor any thing to any, if</li>
  <li>I be not thine. To this I am most constant,</li>
  <li>Though destiny say no. Be merry, gentle;</li>
  <li>Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing</li>
  <li class="number">That you behold the while. Your guests are coming:</li>

  <li>Fie, daughter! when my old wife lived, upon</li>

  <li>These unknown friends to’s welcome; for it is</li>
  <li class="number">A way to make us better friends, more known.</li>
  <li>Come, quench your blushes and present yourself</li>

  <li class="number"><stagedir>To POLIXENES</stagedir>                  Sir, welcome:</li>
  <li>It is my father’s will I should take on me</li>
  <li>The hostess-ship o’ the day.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">To CAMILLO</li>
  <li>You’re welcome, sir.</li>
  <li>Give me those flowers there, Dorcas. Reverend sirs,</li>
  <li class="number">For you there’s rosemary and rue; these keep</li>
  <li>Seeming and savour all the winter long:</li>
  <li>Grace and remembrance be to you both,</li>
  <li>And welcome to our shearing!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li>Shepherdess,</li>
  <li class="number">A fair one are you — well you fit our ages</li>
  <li>With flowers of winter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PERDITA">
  <li>Sir, the year growing ancient,</li>
  <li>Not yet on summer’s death, nor on the birth</li>
  <li>Of trembling winter, the fairest</li>
  <li class="number">flowers o’ the season</li>
  <li>Are our carnations and streak’d gillyvors,</li>
  <li>Which some call nature’s bastards: of that kind</li>
  <li>Our rustic garden’s barren; and I care not</li>
  <li>To get slips of them.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li class="number">Wherefore, gentle maiden,</li>
  <li>Do you neglect them?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PERDITA">
  <li>For I have heard it said</li>
  <li>There is an art which in their piedness shares</li>
  <li>With great creating nature.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li class="number">Say there be;</li>
  <li>Yet nature is made better by no mean</li>
  <li>But nature makes that mean: so, over that art</li>
  <li>Which you say adds to nature, is an art</li>
  <li>That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry</li>
  <li class="number">A gentler scion to the wildest stock,</li>
  <li>And make conceive a bark of baser kind</li>
  <li>By bud of nobler race: this is an art</li>
  <li>Which does mend nature, change it rather, but</li>
  <li>The art itself is nature.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PERDITA">
  <li class="number">So it is.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li>Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,</li>
  <li>And do not call them bastards.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PERDITA">
  <li>I’ll not put</li>
  <li>The dibble in earth to set one slip of them;</li>
  <li class="number">No more than were I painted I would wish</li>
  <li>This youth should say ’twere well and only therefore</li>
  <li>Desire to breed by me. Here’s flowers for you;</li>
  <li>Hot lavender, mints, savoury, marjoram;</li>
  <li>The marigold, that goes to bed wi’ the sun</li>
  <li class="number">And with him rises weeping: these are flowers</li>
  <li>Of middle summer, and I think they are given</li>
  <li>To men of middle age. You’re very welcome.</li>

  <li>You’d be so lean, that blasts of January</li>
  <li>Would blow you through and through.</li>
  <li>Now, my fair’st friend,</li>
  <li>I would I had some flowers o’ the spring that might</li>
  <li class="number">Become your time of day; and yours, and yours,</li>
  <li>That wear upon your virgin branches yet</li>
  <li>Your maidenheads growing: O Proserpina,</li>
  <li>For the flowers now, that frighted thou let’st fall</li>
  <li>From Dis’s waggon! daffodils,</li>
  <li class="number">That come before the swallow dares, and take</li>
  <li>The winds of March with beauty; violets dim,</li>
  <li>But sweeter than the lids of Juno’s eyes</li>
  <li>Or Cytherea’s breath; pale primroses</li>
  <li>That die unmarried, ere they can behold</li>
  <li class="number">Bight Phoebus in his strength — a malady</li>
  <li>Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and</li>
  <li>The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,</li>
  <li>The flower-de-luce being one! O, these I lack,</li>
  <li>To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,</li>
  <li class="number">To strew him o’er and o’er!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLORIZEL">
  <li>What, like a corse?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PERDITA">
  <li>No, like a bank for love to lie and play on;</li>
  <li>Not like a corse; or if, not to be buried,</li>
  <li>But quick and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers:</li>
  <li class="number">Methinks I play as I have seen them do</li>
  <li>In Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine</li>
  <li>Does change my disposition.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLORIZEL">
  <li>What you do</li>
  <li>Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet.</li>
  <li class="number">I’ld have you do it ever: when you sing,</li>
  <li>I’ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms,</li>
  <li>Pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,</li>
  <li>To sing them too: when you do dance, I wish you</li>
  <li>A wave o’ the sea, that you might ever do</li>
  <li class="number">Nothing but that; move still, still so,</li>
  <li>And own no other function: each your doing,</li>
  <li>So singular in each particular,</li>
  <li>Crowns what you are doing in the present deed,</li>
  <li>That all your acts are queens.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PERDITA">
  <li class="number">O Doricles,</li>
  <li>Your praises are too large: but that your youth,</li>
  <li>And the true blood which peepeth fairly through’t,</li>
  <li>Do plainly give you out an unstain’d shepherd,</li>
  <li>With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,</li>
  <li class="number">You woo’d me the false way.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLORIZEL">
  <li>I think you have</li>
  <li>As little skill to fear as I have purpose</li>
  <li>To put you to’t. But come; our dance, I pray:</li>
  <li>Your hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair,</li>
  <li class="number">That never mean to part.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PERDITA">
  <li>I’ll swear for ’em.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li>This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever</li>
  <li>Ran on the green-sward: nothing she does or seems</li>
  <li>But smacks of something greater than herself,</li>
  <li class="number">Too noble for this place.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">

  <li>Which dances with your daughter?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Shepherd">
  <li>They call him Doricles; and boasts himself</li>
  <li>To have a worthy feeding: but I have it</li>
  <li>Upon his own report and I believe it;</li>
  <li class="number">He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter:</li>
  <li>I think so too; for never gazed the moon</li>
  <li>Upon the water as he’ll stand and read</li>
  <li>As ’twere my daughter’s eyes: and, to be plain.</li>
  <li>I think there is not half a kiss to choose</li>
  <li class="number">Who loves another best.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li>She dances featly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Shepherd">
  <li>So she does any thing; though I report it,</li>
  <li>That should be silent: if young Doricles</li>

<ol data-speaker="Servant">
  <li>O master, if you did but hear the pedlar at the</li>

  <li>pipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you: he sings</li>
  <li>several tunes faster than you’ll tell money; he</li>
  <li class="number">utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men’s</li>
  <li>ears grew to his tunes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Clown">
  <li>He could never come better; he shall come in. I</li>
  <li>love a ballad but even too well, if it be doleful</li>
  <li>matter merrily set down, or a very pleasant thing</li>
  <li class="number">indeed and sung lamentably.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Servant">
  <li>He hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes; no</li>
  <li>milliner can so fit his customers with gloves: he</li>
  <li>has the prettiest love-songs for maids; so without</li>
  <li>bawdry, which is strange; with such delicate</li>
  <li class="number">burthens of dildos and fadings, ’jump her and thump</li>
  <li>her;’ and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would,</li>
  <li>as it were, mean mischief and break a foul gap into</li>
  <li>the matter, he makes the maid to answer ’Whoop, do me</li>
  <li>no harm, good man;’ puts him off, slights him, with</li>
  <li class="number">’Whoop, do me no harm, good man.’</li>

  <li>This is a brave fellow.</li>

  <li class="number">points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can</li>
  <li>learnedly handle, though they come to him by the</li>
  <li>gross: inkles, caddisses, cambrics, lawns: why, he</li>
  <li>sings ’em over as they were gods or goddesses; you</li>
  <li>would think a smock were a she-angel, he so chants</li>
  <li class="number">to the sleeve-hand and the work about the square on’t.</li>

  <li class="number">He’s simple and tells much.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">To FLORIZEL</li>
  <li>How now, fair shepherd!</li>
  <li>Your heart is full of something that does take</li>
  <li>Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young</li>
  <li>And handed love as you do, I was wont</li>
  <li class="number">To load my she with knacks: I would have ransack’d</li>
  <li>The pedlar’s silken treasury and have pour’d it</li>
  <li>To her acceptance; you have let him go</li>
  <li>And nothing marted with him. If your lass</li>
  <li>Interpretation should abuse and call this</li>
  <li class="number">Your lack of love or bounty, you were straited</li>
  <li>For a reply, at least if you make a care</li>
  <li>Of happy holding her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLORIZEL">
  <li>Old sir, I know</li>
  <li>She prizes not such trifles as these are:</li>
  <li class="number">The gifts she looks from me are pack’d and lock’d</li>
  <li>Up in my heart; which I have given already,</li>
  <li>But not deliver’d. O, hear me breathe my life</li>
  <li>Before this ancient sir, who, it should seem,</li>
  <li>Hath sometime loved! I take thy hand, this hand,</li>
  <li class="number">As soft as dove’s down and as white as it,</li>
  <li>Or Ethiopian’s tooth, or the fann’d</li>
  <li>snow that’s bolted</li>
  <li>By the northern blasts twice o’er.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li>What follows this?</li>
  <li class="number">How prettily the young swain seems to wash</li>
  <li>The hand was fair before! I have put you out:</li>
  <li>But to your protestation; let me hear</li>
  <li>What you profess.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLORIZEL">
  <li>Do, and be witness to ’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li class="number">And this my neighbour too?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLORIZEL">
  <li>And he, and more</li>
  <li>Than he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all:</li>
  <li>That, were I crown’d the most imperial monarch,</li>
  <li>Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth</li>
  <li class="number">That ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge</li>
  <li>More than was ever man’s, I would not prize them</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li class="number">Fairly offer’d.</li>

  <li>This shows a sound affection.</li>

<ol data-speaker="PERDITA">
  <li>I cannot speak</li>

</ol>

  <li>Take hands, a bargain!</li>

<ol data-speaker="FLORIZEL">
  <li>O, that must be</li>
  <li>I’ the virtue of your daughter: one being dead,</li>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li>Knows he of this?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLORIZEL">
  <li>He neither does nor shall.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li>Methinks a father</li>
  <li class="number">Is at the nuptial of his son a guest</li>
  <li>That best becomes the table. Pray you once more,</li>
  <li>Is not your father grown incapable</li>
  <li>Of reasonable affairs? is he not stupid</li>
  <li>With age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear?</li>
  <li class="number">Know man from man? dispute his own estate?</li>
  <li>Lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing</li>
  <li>But what he did being childish?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLORIZEL">
  <li>No, good sir;</li>
  <li>He has his health and ampler strength indeed</li>
  <li class="number">Than most have of his age.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li>By my white beard,</li>
  <li>You offer him, if this be so, a wrong</li>
  <li>Something unfilial: reason my son</li>
  <li>Should choose himself a wife, but as good reason</li>
  <li class="number">The father, all whose joy is nothing else</li>
  <li>But fair posterity, should hold some counsel</li>
  <li>In such a business.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLORIZEL">
  <li>I yield all this;</li>
  <li>But for some other reasons, my grave sir,</li>
  <li class="number">Which ’tis not fit you know, I not acquaint</li>
  <li>My father of this business.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li>Let him know’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLORIZEL">
  <li>He shall not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li>Prithee, let him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLORIZEL">
  <li class="number">No, he must not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Shepherd">
  <li>Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve</li>
  <li>At knowing of thy choice.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLORIZEL">
  <li>Come, come, he must not.</li>
  <li>Mark our contract.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li class="number">Mark your divorce, young sir,</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Discovering himself</li>
  <li>Whom son I dare not call; thou art too base</li>
  <li>To be acknowledged: thou a sceptre’s heir,</li>
  <li>That thus affect’st a sheep-hook! Thou old traitor,</li>
  <li>I am sorry that by hanging thee I can</li>
  <li class="number">But shorten thy life one week. And thou, fresh piece</li>
  <li>Of excellent witchcraft, who of force must know</li>
  <li>The royal fool thou copest with — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Shepherd">
  <li>O, my heart!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li>I’ll have thy beauty scratch’d with briers, and made</li>
  <li class="number">More homely than thy state. For thee, fond boy,</li>
  <li>If I may ever know thou dost but sigh</li>
  <li>That thou no more shalt see this knack, as never</li>
  <li>I mean thou shalt, we’ll bar thee from succession;</li>
  <li>Not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,</li>
  <li class="number">Far than Deucalion off: mark thou my words:</li>
  <li>Follow us to the court. Thou churl, for this time,</li>
  <li>Though full of our displeasure, yet we free thee</li>
  <li>From the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment. — </li>
  <li>Worthy enough a herdsman: yea, him too,</li>
  <li class="number">That makes himself, but for our honour therein,</li>
  <li>Unworthy thee — if ever henceforth thou</li>
  <li>These rural latches to his entrance open,</li>
  <li>Or hoop his body more with thy embraces,</li>
  <li>I will devise a death as cruel for thee</li>
  <li class="number">As thou art tender to’t.</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<ol data-speaker="PERDITA">
  <li>Even here undone!</li>
  <li>I was not much afeard; for once or twice</li>

  <li>The selfsame sun that shines upon his court</li>
  <li class="number">Hides not his visage from our cottage but</li>
  <li>Looks on alike. Will’t please you, sir, be gone?</li>
  <li>I told you what would come of this: beseech you,</li>
  <li>Of your own state take care: this dream of mine — </li>

  <li class="number">You have undone a man of fourscore three,</li>
  <li>That thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea,</li>
  <li>To die upon the bed my father died,</li>
  <li>To lie close by his honest bones: but now</li>
  <li>Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me</li>
  <li class="number">Where no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch,</li>

  <li>and wouldst adventure</li>
  <li>To mingle faith with him! Undone! undone!</li>
  <li>If I might die within this hour, I have lived</li>

</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<ol data-speaker="FLORIZEL">
  <li>Why look you so upon me?</li>
  <li>I am but sorry, not afeard; delay’d,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li>Gracious my lord,</li>
  <li>You know your father’s temper: at this time</li>

  <li>You do not purpose to him; and as hardly</li>
  <li class="number">Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear:</li>
  <li>Then, till the fury of his highness settle,</li>

</ol>

  <li>I not purpose it.</li>
  <li>I think, Camillo?</li>

<ol data-speaker="PERDITA">
  <li>How often have I told you ’twould be thus!</li>

  <li>But till ’twere known!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLORIZEL">
  <li>It cannot fail but by</li>
  <li class="number">The violation of my faith; and then</li>
  <li>Let nature crush the sides o’ the earth together</li>
  <li>And mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks:</li>
  <li>From my succession wipe me, father; I</li>
  <li>Am heir to my affection.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li class="number">Be advised.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLORIZEL">
  <li>I am, and by my fancy: if my reason</li>

  <li>If not, my senses, better pleased with madness,</li>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li class="number">This is desperate, sir.</li>

<ol data-speaker="FLORIZEL">
  <li>So call it: but it does fulfil my vow;</li>
  <li>I needs must think it honesty. Camillo,</li>
  <li>Not for Bohemia, nor the pomp that may</li>
  <li>Be thereat glean’d, for all the sun sees or</li>
  <li class="number">The close earth wombs or the profound sea hides</li>
  <li>In unknown fathoms, will I break my oath</li>
  <li>To this my fair beloved: therefore, I pray you,</li>
  <li>As you have ever been my father’s honour’d friend,</li>
  <li>When he shall miss me — as, in faith, I mean not</li>
  <li class="number">To see him any more — cast your good counsels</li>
  <li>Upon his passion; let myself and fortune</li>
  <li>Tug for the time to come. This you may know</li>
  <li>And so deliver, I am put to sea</li>
  <li>With her whom here I cannot hold on shore;</li>
  <li class="number">And most opportune to our need I have</li>
  <li>A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li class="number">O my lord!</li>

<ol data-speaker="FLORIZEL">
  <li>Hark, Perdita</li>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li class="number">He’s irremoveable,</li>

  <li>His going I could frame to serve my turn,</li>
  <li>Save him from danger, do him love and honour,</li>
  <li>Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia</li>
  <li class="number">And that unhappy king, my master, whom</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLORIZEL">
  <li>Now, good Camillo;</li>
  <li>I am so fraught with curious business that</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li class="number">Sir, I think</li>
  <li>You have heard of my poor services, i’ the love</li>
  <li>That I have borne your father?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLORIZEL">
  <li>Very nobly</li>
  <li>Have you deserved: it is my father’s music</li>
  <li class="number">To speak your deeds, not little of his care</li>
  <li>To have them recompensed as thought on.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li>Well, my lord,</li>
  <li>If you may please to think I love the king</li>
  <li>And through him what is nearest to him, which is</li>
  <li class="number">Your gracious self, embrace but my direction:</li>
  <li>If your more ponderous and settled project</li>
  <li>May suffer alteration, on mine honour,</li>
  <li>I’ll point you where you shall have such receiving</li>
  <li>As shall become your highness; where you may</li>
  <li class="number">Enjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,</li>
  <li>There’s no disjunction to be made, but by — </li>
  <li>As heavens forefend! — your ruin; marry her,</li>
  <li>And, with my best endeavours in your absence,</li>
  <li>Your discontenting father strive to qualify</li>
  <li class="number">And bring him up to liking.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLORIZEL">
  <li>How, Camillo,</li>
  <li>May this, almost a miracle, be done?</li>
  <li>That I may call thee something more than man</li>
  <li>And after that trust to thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li class="number">Have you thought on</li>
  <li>A place whereto you’ll go?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLORIZEL">
  <li>Not any yet:</li>
  <li>But as the unthought-on accident is guilty</li>
  <li>To what we wildly do, so we profess</li>
  <li class="number">Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies</li>
  <li>Of every wind that blows.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li>Then list to me:</li>
  <li>This follows, if you will not change your purpose</li>
  <li>But undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,</li>
  <li class="number">And there present yourself and your fair princess,</li>
  <li>For so I see she must be, ’fore Leontes:</li>
  <li>She shall be habited as it becomes</li>
  <li>The partner of your bed. Methinks I see</li>
  <li>Leontes opening his free arms and weeping</li>
  <li class="number">His welcomes forth; asks thee the son forgiveness,</li>
  <li>As ’twere i’ the father’s person; kisses the hands</li>
  <li>Of your fresh princess; o’er and o’er divides him</li>
  <li>’Twixt his unkindness and his kindness; the one</li>
  <li>He chides to hell and bids the other grow</li>
  <li class="number">Faster than thought or time.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLORIZEL">
  <li>Worthy Camillo,</li>
  <li>What colour for my visitation shall I</li>
  <li>Hold up before him?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li>Sent by the king your father</li>
  <li class="number">To greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,</li>
  <li>The manner of your bearing towards him, with</li>
  <li>What you as from your father shall deliver,</li>
  <li>Things known betwixt us three, I’ll write you down:</li>
  <li>The which shall point you forth at every sitting</li>
  <li class="number">What you must say; that he shall not perceive</li>
  <li>But that you have your father’s bosom there</li>
  <li>And speak his very heart.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLORIZEL">
  <li>I am bound to you:</li>
  <li>There is some sap in this.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li class="number">A cause more promising</li>
  <li>Than a wild dedication of yourselves</li>
  <li>To unpath’d waters, undream’d shores, most certain</li>
  <li>To miseries enough; no hope to help you,</li>
  <li>But as you shake off one to take another;</li>
  <li class="number">Nothing so certain as your anchors, who</li>
  <li>Do their best office, if they can but stay you</li>
  <li>Where you’ll be loath to be: besides you know</li>
  <li>Prosperity’s the very bond of love,</li>
  <li>Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together</li>
  <li class="number">Affliction alters.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PERDITA">
  <li>One of these is true:</li>
  <li>I think affliction may subdue the cheek,</li>
  <li>But not take in the mind.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li>Yea, say you so?</li>
  <li class="number">There shall not at your father’s house these</li>
  <li>seven years</li>
  <li>Be born another such.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FLORIZEL">
  <li>My good Camillo,</li>
  <li>She is as forward of her breeding as</li>
  <li class="number">She is i’ the rear our birth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li>I cannot say ’tis pity</li>
  <li>She lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress</li>
  <li>To most that teach.</li>
</ol>

  <li>The medicine of our house, how shall we do?</li>

  <li>My lord,</li>

<ol data-speaker="AUTOLYCUS">
  <li>Ha, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his</li>
  <li>sworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have sold</li>
  <li class="number">all my trumpery; not a counterfeit stone, not a</li>
  <li>ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad,</li>
  <li>knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring,</li>
  <li>to keep my pack from fasting: they throng who</li>
  <li>should buy first, as if my trinkets had been</li>
  <li class="number">hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer:</li>
  <li>by which means I saw whose purse was best in</li>
  <li>picture; and what I saw, to my good use I</li>
  <li>remembered. My clown, who wants but something to</li>
  <li>be a reasonable man, grew so in love with the</li>
  <li class="number">wenches’ song, that he would not stir his pettitoes</li>
  <li>till he had both tune and words; which so drew the</li>
  <li>rest of the herd to me that all their other senses</li>
  <li>stuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, it</li>
  <li>was senseless; ’twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a</li>
  <li class="number">purse; I could have filed keys off that hung in</li>
  <li>chains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir’s song,</li>
  <li>and admiring the nothing of it. So that in this</li>
  <li>time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their</li>
  <li>festival purses; and had not the old man come in</li>
  <li class="number">with a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king’s</li>
  <li>son and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had not</li>
  <li>left a purse alive in the whole army.</li>

  <li>I understand the business, I hear it: to have an</li>

  <li class="number">The fardel there? what’s i’ the fardel?</li>

  <li>Age, thou hast lost thy labour.</li>

  <li>Why, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUTOLYCUS">
  <li>The king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard a</li>

  <li class="number">if thou beest capable of things serious, thou must</li>
  <li>know the king is full of grief.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Shepard">
  <li>So ’tis said, sir; about his son, that should have</li>

<ol data-speaker="AUTOLYCUS">
  <li>If that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly:</li>
  <li class="number">the curses he shall have, the tortures he shall</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Clown">
  <li>Think you so, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUTOLYCUS">
  <li>Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy</li>
  <li>and vengeance bitter; but those that are germane to</li>
  <li class="number">him, though removed fifty times, shall all come</li>
  <li>under the hangman: which though it be great pity,</li>
  <li>yet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue a</li>
  <li>ram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come into</li>
  <li>grace! Some say he shall be stoned; but that death</li>
  <li class="number">is too soft for him, say I draw our throne into a</li>
  <li>sheep-cote! all deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Clown">
  <li>Has the old man e’er a son, sir, do you hear. an’t</li>
  <li>like you, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUTOLYCUS">
  <li>He has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then</li>
  <li class="number">’nointed over with honey, set on the head of a</li>
  <li>wasp’s nest; then stand till he be three quarters</li>
  <li>and a dram dead; then recovered again with</li>
  <li>aqua-vitae or some other hot infusion; then, raw as</li>
  <li>he is, and in the hottest day prognostication</li>
  <li class="number">proclaims, shall be be set against a brick-wall, the</li>
  <li>sun looking with a southward eye upon him, where he</li>
  <li>is to behold him with flies blown to death. But what</li>
  <li>talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries</li>
  <li>are to be smiled at, their offences being so</li>
  <li class="number">capital? Tell me, for you seem to be honest plain</li>
  <li>men, what you have to the king: being something</li>
  <li>gently considered, I’ll bring you where he is</li>
  <li>aboard, tender your persons to his presence,</li>
  <li>whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in man</li>
  <li class="number">besides the king to effect your suits, here is man</li>
  <li>shall do it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Clown">
  <li>He seems to be of great authority: close with him,</li>
  <li>give him gold; and though authority be a stubborn</li>
  <li>bear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold: show</li>
  <li class="number">the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand,</li>
  <li>and no more ado. Remember ’stoned,’ and ’flayed alive.’</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Shepherd">
  <li>An’t please you, sir, to undertake the business for</li>
  <li>us, here is that gold I have: I’ll make it as much</li>
  <li>more and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUTOLYCUS">
  <li class="number">After I have done what I promised?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Shepherd">
  <li>Ay, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUTOLYCUS">
  <li>Well, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this business?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Clown">
  <li>In some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitiful</li>
  <li>one, I hope I shall not be flayed out of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUTOLYCUS">
  <li class="number">O, that’s the case of the shepherd’s son: hang him,</li>
  <li>he’ll be made an example.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Clown">
  <li>Comfort, good comfort! We must to the king and show</li>
  <li>our strange sights: he must know ’tis none of your</li>
  <li>daughter nor my sister; we are gone else. Sir, I</li>
  <li class="number">will give you as much as this old man does when the</li>
  <li>business is performed, and remain, as he says, your</li>
  <li>pawn till it be brought you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUTOLYCUS">
  <li>I will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side;</li>
  <li>go on the right hand: I will but look upon the</li>
  <li class="number">hedge and follow you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Clown">
  <li>We are blest in this man, as I may say, even blest.</li>

<ol data-speaker="CLEOMENES">
  <li>Sir, you have done enough, and have perform’d</li>
  <li>A saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make,</li>
  <li>Which you have not redeem’d; indeed, paid down</li>
  <li>More penitence than done trespass: at the last,</li>
  <li class="number">Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil;</li>
  <li>With them forgive yourself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>Whilst I remember</li>
  <li>Her and her virtues, I cannot forget</li>
  <li>My blemishes in them, and so still think of</li>
  <li class="number">The wrong I did myself; which was so much,</li>
  <li>That heirless it hath made my kingdom and</li>
  <li>Destroy’d the sweet’st companion that e’er man</li>
  <li>Bred his hopes out of.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAULINA">
  <li>True, too true, my lord:</li>
  <li class="number">If, one by one, you wedded all the world,</li>
  <li>Or from the all that are took something good,</li>
  <li>To make a perfect woman, she you kill’d</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>I think so. Kill’d!</li>
  <li class="number">She I kill’d! I did so: but thou strikest me</li>
  <li>Sorely, to say I did; it is as bitter</li>
  <li>Upon thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now,</li>
  <li>Say so but seldom.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLEOMENES">
  <li>Not at all, good lady:</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DION">
  <li class="number">If you would not so,</li>
  <li>You pity not the state, nor the remembrance</li>

  <li>What dangers, by his highness’ fail of issue,</li>
  <li>May drop upon his kingdom and devour</li>

  <li>There is none worthy,</li>

  <li class="number">Is’t not the tenor of his oracle,</li>
  <li>That King Leontes shall not have an heir</li>
  <li>Till his lost child be found? which that it shall,</li>
  <li>Is all as monstrous to our human reason</li>
  <li>As my Antigonus to break his grave</li>
  <li class="number">And come again to me; who, on my life,</li>
  <li>Did perish with the infant. ’Tis your counsel</li>

  <li class="stage-direction">To LEONTES</li>

  <li>Good Paulina,</li>

  <li>Thou speak’st truth.</li>
  <li>No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,</li>

  <li>I should so.</li>
  <li>Were I the ghost that walk’d, I’ld bid you mark</li>

  <li>You chose her; then I’ld shriek, that even your ears</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  Before LEONTES’ palace.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter AUTOLYCUS and a Gentleman</div>

<ol data-speaker="AUTOLYCUS">
  <li>Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Gentleman">
  <li>I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old</li>
  <li>shepherd deliver the manner how he found it:</li>
  <li>whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all</li>
  <li class="number">commanded out of the chamber; only this methought I</li>
  <li>heard the shepherd say, he found the child.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUTOLYCUS">
  <li>I would most gladly know the issue of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Gentleman">
  <li>I make a broken delivery of the business; but the</li>
  <li>changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were</li>
  <li class="number">very notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with</li>
  <li>staring on one another, to tear the cases of their</li>
  <li>eyes; there was speech in their dumbness, language</li>
  <li>in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard</li>
  <li>of a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable</li>
  <li class="number">passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest</li>
  <li>beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not</li>
  <li>say if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the</li>
  <li>extremity of the one, it must needs be.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter another Gentleman</li>
  <li>Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more.</li>
  <li class="number">The news, Rogero?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Gentleman">
  <li>Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; the</li>
  <li>king’s daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is</li>
  <li>broken out within this hour that ballad-makers</li>
  <li>cannot be able to express it.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter a third Gentleman</li>
  <li class="number">Here comes the Lady Paulina’s steward: he can</li>
  <li>deliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this news</li>
  <li>which is called true is so like an old tale, that</li>
  <li>the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king</li>
  <li>found his heir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Third Gentleman">
  <li class="number">Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by</li>
  <li>circumstance: that which you hear you’ll swear you</li>
  <li>see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle</li>
  <li>of Queen Hermione’s, her jewel about the neck of it,</li>
  <li>the letters of Antigonus found with it which they</li>
  <li class="number">know to be his character, the majesty of the</li>
  <li>creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection</li>
  <li>of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,</li>
  <li>and many other evidences proclaim her with all</li>
  <li>certainty to be the king’s daughter. Did you see</li>
  <li class="number">the meeting of the two kings?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Gentleman">
  <li>No.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Third Gentleman">
  <li>Then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,</li>
  <li>cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one</li>
  <li>joy crown another, so and in such manner that it</li>
  <li class="number">seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their</li>
  <li>joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes,</li>
  <li>holding up of hands, with countenances of such</li>
  <li>distraction that they were to be known by garment,</li>
  <li>not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of</li>
  <li class="number">himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that</li>
  <li>joy were now become a loss, cries ’O, thy mother,</li>
  <li>thy mother!’ then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then</li>
  <li>embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his</li>
  <li>daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old</li>
  <li class="number">shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten</li>
  <li>conduit of many kings’ reigns. I never heard of such</li>
  <li>another encounter, which lames report to follow it</li>
  <li>and undoes description to do it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Gentleman">
  <li>What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried</li>
  <li class="number">hence the child?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Third Gentleman">
  <li>Like an old tale still, which will have matter to</li>
  <li>rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear</li>
  <li>open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this</li>
  <li>avouches the shepherd’s son; who has not only his</li>
  <li class="number">innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a</li>
  <li>handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Gentleman">
  <li>What became of his bark and his followers?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Third Gentleman">
  <li>Wrecked the same instant of their master’s death and</li>
  <li>in the view of the shepherd: so that all the</li>
  <li class="number">instruments which aided to expose the child were</li>
  <li>even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble</li>
  <li>combat that ’twixt joy and sorrow was fought in</li>
  <li>Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of</li>
  <li>her husband, another elevated that the oracle was</li>
  <li class="number">fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,</li>
  <li>and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin</li>
  <li>her to her heart that she might no more be in danger</li>
  <li>of losing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Gentleman">
  <li>The dignity of this act was worth the audience of</li>
  <li class="number">kings and princes; for by such was it acted.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Third Gentleman">
  <li>One of the prettiest touches of all and that which</li>
  <li>angled for mine eyes, caught the water though not</li>
  <li>the fish, was when, at the relation of the queen’s</li>
  <li>death, with the manner how she came to’t bravely</li>
  <li class="number">confessed and lamented by the king, how</li>
  <li>attentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one</li>
  <li>sign of dolour to another, she did, with an ’Alas,’</li>
  <li>I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my</li>
  <li>heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed</li>
  <li class="number">colour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world</li>
  <li>could have seen ’t, the woe had been universal.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Gentleman">
  <li>Are they returned to the court?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Third Gentleman">
  <li>No: the princess hearing of her mother’s statue,</li>
  <li>which is in the keeping of Paulina — a piece many</li>
  <li class="number">years in doing and now newly performed by that rare</li>
  <li>Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself</li>
  <li>eternity and could put breath into his work, would</li>
  <li>beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her</li>
  <li>ape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that</li>
  <li class="number">they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of</li>
  <li>answer: thither with all greediness of affection</li>
  <li>are they gone, and there they intend to sup.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Gentleman">
  <li>I thought she had some great matter there in hand;</li>
  <li>for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever</li>
  <li class="number">since the death of Hermione, visited that removed</li>
  <li>house. Shall we thither and with our company piece</li>
  <li>the rejoicing?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Gentleman">
  <li>Who would be thence that has the benefit of access?</li>
  <li>every wink of an eye some new grace will be born:</li>
  <li class="number">our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.</li>
  <li>Let’s along.</li>

  <li>so we wept, and there was the first gentleman-like</li>
  <li>tears that ever we shed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Shepherd">
  <li>We may live, son, to shed many more.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Clown">
  <li>Ay; or else ’twere hard luck, being in so</li>
  <li class="number">preposterous estate as we are.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUTOLYCUS">
  <li>I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the</li>
  <li>faults I have committed to your worship and to give</li>
  <li>me your good report to the prince my master.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Shepherd">
  <li>Prithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we are</li>
  <li class="number">gentlemen.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Clown">
  <li>Thou wilt amend thy life?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUTOLYCUS">
  <li>Ay, an it like your good worship.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Clown">
  <li>Give me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thou</li>
  <li>art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Shepherd">
  <li class="number">You may say it, but not swear it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Clown">
  <li>Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and</li>
  <li>franklins say it, I’ll swear it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Shepherd">
  <li>How if it be false, son?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Clown">
  <li>If it be ne’er so false, a true gentleman may swear</li>
  <li class="number">it in the behalf of his friend: and I’ll swear to</li>
  <li>the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and</li>
  <li>that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no</li>
  <li>tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be</li>
  <li>drunk: but I’ll swear it, and I would thou wouldst</li>
  <li class="number">be a tall fellow of thy hands.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUTOLYCUS">
  <li>I will prove so, sir, to my power.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Clown">
  <li>Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow: if I do not</li>
  <li>wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk, not</li>
  <li>being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kings</li>
  <li class="number">and the princes, our kindred, are going to see the</li>
  <li>queen’s picture. Come, follow us: we’ll be thy</li>
  <li>good masters.</li>

<h3>SCENE III.  A chapel in PAULINA’S house.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter LEONTES, POLIXENES, FLORIZEL, PERDITA,
CAMILLO, PAULINA, Lords, and Attendants</div>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort</li>
  <li>That I have had of thee!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAULINA">
  <li>What, sovereign sir,</li>
  <li>I did not well I meant well. All my services</li>
  <li class="number">You have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed,</li>
  <li>With your crown’d brother and these your contracted</li>
  <li>Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,</li>
  <li>It is a surplus of your grace, which never</li>
  <li>My life may last to answer.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li class="number">O Paulina,</li>
  <li>We honour you with trouble: but we came</li>
  <li>To see the statue of our queen: your gallery</li>
  <li>Have we pass’d through, not without much content</li>
  <li>In many singularities; but we saw not</li>
  <li class="number">That which my daughter came to look upon,</li>
  <li>The statue of her mother.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAULINA">
  <li>As she lived peerless,</li>
  <li>So her dead likeness, I do well believe,</li>
  <li>Excels whatever yet you look’d upon</li>
  <li class="number">Or hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it</li>
  <li>Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare</li>
  <li>To see the life as lively mock’d as ever</li>
  <li>Still sleep mock’d death: behold, and say ’tis well.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">PAULINA draws a curtain, and discovers HERMIONE
standing like a statue</li>
  <li>I like your silence, it the more shows off</li>
  <li class="number">Your wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege,</li>
  <li>Comes it not something near?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>Her natural posture!</li>
  <li>Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed</li>
  <li>Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she</li>
  <li class="number">In thy not chiding, for she was as tender</li>
  <li>As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,</li>
  <li>Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing</li>
  <li>So aged as this seems.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li>O, not by much.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAULINA">
  <li class="number">So much the more our carver’s excellence;</li>
  <li>Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her</li>
  <li>As she lived now.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>As now she might have done,</li>
  <li>So much to my good comfort, as it is</li>
  <li class="number">Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,</li>
  <li>Even with such life of majesty, warm life,</li>
  <li>As now it coldly stands, when first I woo’d her!</li>
  <li>I am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me</li>
  <li>For being more stone than it? O royal piece,</li>
  <li class="number">There’s magic in thy majesty, which has</li>
  <li>My evils conjured to remembrance and</li>
  <li>From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,</li>
  <li>Standing like stone with thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PERDITA">
  <li>And give me leave,</li>
  <li class="number">And do not say ’tis superstition, that</li>
  <li>I kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady,</li>
  <li>Dear queen, that ended when I but began,</li>
  <li>Give me that hand of yours to kiss.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAULINA">
  <li>O, patience!</li>
  <li class="number">The statue is but newly fix’d, the colour’s Not dry.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li>My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,</li>
  <li>Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,</li>
  <li>So many summers dry; scarce any joy</li>
  <li>Did ever so long live; no sorrow</li>
  <li class="number">But kill’d itself much sooner.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li>Dear my brother,</li>
  <li>Let him that was the cause of this have power</li>
  <li>To take off so much grief from you as he</li>
  <li>Will piece up in himself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAULINA">
  <li class="number">Indeed, my lord,</li>
  <li>If I had thought the sight of my poor image</li>
  <li>Would thus have wrought you — for the stone is mine — </li>
  <li>I’ld not have show’d it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>Do not draw the curtain.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAULINA">
  <li class="number">No longer shall you gaze on’t, lest your fancy</li>
  <li>May think anon it moves.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>Let be, let be.</li>
  <li>Would I were dead, but that, methinks, already — </li>
  <li>What was he that did make it? See, my lord,</li>
  <li class="number">Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins</li>
  <li>Did verily bear blood?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li>Masterly done:</li>
  <li>The very life seems warm upon her lip.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>The fixture of her eye has motion in’t,</li>
  <li class="number">As we are mock’d with art.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAULINA">
  <li>I’ll draw the curtain:</li>
  <li>My lord’s almost so far transported that</li>
  <li>He’ll think anon it lives.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>O sweet Paulina,</li>
  <li class="number">Make me to think so twenty years together!</li>
  <li>No settled senses of the world can match</li>
  <li>The pleasure of that madness. Let ’t alone.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAULINA">
  <li>I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr’d you: but</li>
  <li>I could afflict you farther.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li class="number">Do, Paulina;</li>
  <li>For this affliction has a taste as sweet</li>
  <li>As any cordial comfort. Still, methinks,</li>
  <li>There is an air comes from her: what fine chisel</li>
  <li>Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,</li>
  <li class="number">For I will kiss her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAULINA">
  <li>Good my lord, forbear:</li>
  <li>The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;</li>
  <li>You’ll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own</li>
  <li>With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li class="number">No, not these twenty years.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PERDITA">
  <li>So long could I</li>
  <li>Stand by, a looker on.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAULINA">
  <li>Either forbear,</li>
  <li>Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you</li>
  <li class="number">For more amazement. If you can behold it,</li>
  <li>I’ll make the statue move indeed, descend</li>
  <li>And take you by the hand; but then you’ll think — </li>
  <li>Which I protest against — I am assisted</li>
  <li>By wicked powers.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li class="number">What you can make her do,</li>
  <li>I am content to look on: what to speak,</li>
  <li>I am content to hear; for ’tis as easy</li>
  <li>To make her speak as move.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAULINA">
  <li>It is required</li>
  <li class="number">You do awake your faith. Then all stand still;</li>
  <li>On: those that think it is unlawful business</li>
  <li>I am about, let them depart.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>Proceed:</li>
  <li>No foot shall stir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAULINA">
  <li class="number">Music, awake her; strike!</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Music</li>
  <li>’Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;</li>
  <li>Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,</li>
  <li>I’ll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,</li>
  <li>Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him</li>
  <li class="number">Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">HERMIONE comes down</li>
  <li>Start not; her actions shall be holy as</li>
  <li>You hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her</li>
  <li>Until you see her die again; for then</li>
  <li>You kill her double. Nay, present your hand:</li>
  <li class="number">When she was young you woo’d her; now in age</li>
  <li>Is she become the suitor?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>O, she’s warm!</li>
  <li>If this be magic, let it be an art</li>
  <li>Lawful as eating.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li class="number">She embraces him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAMILLO">
  <li>She hangs about his neck:</li>
  <li>If she pertain to life let her speak too.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POLIXENES">
  <li>Ay, and make’t manifest where she has lived,</li>
  <li>Or how stolen from the dead.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAULINA">
  <li class="number">That she is living,</li>
  <li>Were it but told you, should be hooted at</li>
  <li>Like an old tale: but it appears she lives,</li>
  <li>Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.</li>
  <li>Please you to interpose, fair madam: kneel</li>
  <li class="number">And pray your mother’s blessing. Turn, good lady;</li>
  <li>Our Perdita is found.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERMIONE">
  <li>You gods, look down</li>
  <li>And from your sacred vials pour your graces</li>
  <li>Upon my daughter’s head! Tell me, mine own.</li>
  <li class="number">Where hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found</li>
  <li>Thy father’s court? for thou shalt hear that I,</li>
  <li>Knowing by Paulina that the oracle</li>
  <li>Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserved</li>
  <li>Myself to see the issue.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAULINA">
  <li class="number">There’s time enough for that;</li>
  <li>Lest they desire upon this push to trouble</li>
  <li>Your joys with like relation. Go together,</li>
  <li>You precious winners all; your exultation</li>
  <li>Partake to every one. I, an old turtle,</li>
  <li class="number">Will wing me to some wither’d bough and there</li>
  <li>My mate, that’s never to be found again,</li>
  <li>Lament till I am lost.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEONTES">
  <li>O, peace, Paulina!</li>
  <li>Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,</li>
  <li class="number">As I by thine a wife: this is a match,</li>
  <li>And made between’s by vows. Thou hast found mine;</li>
  <li>But how, is to be question’d; for I saw her,</li>
  <li>As I thought, dead, and have in vain said many</li>
  <li>A prayer upon her grave. I’ll not seek far — </li>
  <li class="number">For him, I partly know his mind — to find thee</li>
  <li>An honourable husband. Come, Camillo,</li>
  <li>And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty</li>
  <li>Is richly noted and here justified</li>
  <li>By us, a pair of kings. Let’s from this place.</li>
  <li class="number">What! look upon my brother: both your pardons,</li>
  <li>That e’er I put between your holy looks</li>
  <li>My ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law,</li>
  <li>And son unto the king, who, heavens directing,</li>
  <li>Is troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,</li>
  <li class="number">Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely</li>
  <li>Each one demand an answer to his part</li>
  <li>Perform’d in this wide gap of time since first</li>
  <li>We were dissever’d: hastily lead away.</li>
