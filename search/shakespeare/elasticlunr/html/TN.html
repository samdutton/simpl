<h3>SCENE I.  DUKE ORSINO’s palace.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter DUKE ORSINO, CURIO, and other Lords;
        Musicians attending</div>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE ORSINO">
  <li>If music be the food of love, play on;</li>
  <li>Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,</li>
  <li>The appetite may sicken, and so die.</li>
  <li>That strain again! it had a dying fall:</li>
  <li class="number">O, it came o’er my ear like the sweet sound,</li>
  <li>That breathes upon a bank of violets,</li>
  <li>Stealing and giving odour! Enough; no more:</li>
  <li>’Tis not so sweet now as it was before.</li>
  <li>O spirit of love! how quick and fresh art thou,</li>
  <li class="number">That, notwithstanding thy capacity</li>
  <li>Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,</li>
  <li>Of what validity and pitch soe’er,</li>
  <li>But falls into abatement and low price,</li>
  <li>Even in a minute: so full of shapes is fancy</li>
  <li class="number">That it alone is high fantastical.</li>

<ol data-speaker="CURIO">
  <li>Will you go hunt, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE ORSINO">
  <li>What, Curio?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CURIO">
  <li>The hart.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE ORSINO">
  <li>Why, so I do, the noblest that I have:</li>
  <li class="number">O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,</li>
  <li>Methought she purged the air of pestilence!</li>
  <li>That instant was I turn’d into a hart;</li>
  <li>And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,</li>
  <li>E’er since pursue me.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter VALENTINE</li>
  <li class="number">How now! what news from her?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VALENTINE">
  <li>So please my lord, I might not be admitted;</li>
  <li>But from her handmaid do return this answer:</li>
  <li>The element itself, till seven years’ heat,</li>
  <li>Shall not behold her face at ample view;</li>
  <li class="number">But, like a cloistress, she will veiled walk</li>
  <li>And water once a day her chamber round</li>
  <li>With eye-offending brine: all this to season</li>
  <li>A brother’s dead love, which she would keep fresh</li>
  <li>And lasting in her sad remembrance.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE ORSINO">
  <li class="number">O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame</li>
  <li>To pay this debt of love but to a brother,</li>
  <li>How will she love, when the rich golden shaft</li>
  <li>Hath kill’d the flock of all affections else</li>
  <li>That live in her; when liver, brain and heart,</li>
  <li class="number">These sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and fill’d</li>
  <li>Her sweet perfections with one self king!</li>
  <li>Away before me to sweet beds of flowers:</li>
  <li>Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers.</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  The sea-coast.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter VIOLA, a Captain, and Sailors</div>

<ol data-speaker="VIOLA">
  <li>What country, friends, is this?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Captain">
  <li>This is Illyria, lady.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VIOLA">
  <li>And what should I do in Illyria?</li>
  <li>My brother he is in Elysium.</li>
  <li class="number">Perchance he is not drown’d: what think you, sailors?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Captain">
  <li>It is perchance that you yourself were saved.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VIOLA">
  <li>O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Captain">
  <li>True, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,</li>
  <li>Assure yourself, after our ship did split,</li>
  <li class="number">When you and those poor number saved with you</li>
  <li>Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,</li>
  <li>Most provident in peril, bind himself,</li>
  <li>Courage and hope both teaching him the practise,</li>
  <li>To a strong mast that lived upon the sea;</li>
  <li class="number">Where, like Arion on the dolphin’s back,</li>
  <li>I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves</li>
  <li>So long as I could see.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VIOLA">
  <li>For saying so, there’s gold:</li>
  <li>Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,</li>
  <li class="number">Whereto thy speech serves for authority,</li>
  <li>The like of him. Know’st thou this country?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Captain">
  <li>Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and born</li>
  <li>Not three hours’ travel from this very place.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VIOLA">
  <li>Who governs here?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Captain">
  <li class="number">A noble duke, in nature as in name.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VIOLA">
  <li>What is the name?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Captain">
  <li>Orsino.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VIOLA">
  <li>Orsino! I have heard my father name him:</li>
  <li>He was a bachelor then.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Captain">
  <li class="number">And so is now, or was so very late;</li>
  <li>For but a month ago I went from hence,</li>
  <li>And then ’twas fresh in murmur — as, you know,</li>
  <li>What great ones do the less will prattle of — </li>
  <li>That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VIOLA">
  <li class="number">What’s she?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Captain">
  <li>A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count</li>
  <li>That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her</li>
  <li>In the protection of his son, her brother,</li>
  <li>Who shortly also died: for whose dear love,</li>
  <li class="number">They say, she hath abjured the company</li>
  <li>And sight of men.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VIOLA">
  <li>O that I served that lady</li>
  <li>And might not be delivered to the world,</li>
  <li>Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,</li>
  <li class="number">What my estate is!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Captain">
  <li>That were hard to compass;</li>
  <li>Because she will admit no kind of suit,</li>
  <li>No, not the duke’s.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VIOLA">
  <li>There is a fair behavior in thee, captain;</li>
  <li class="number">And though that nature with a beauteous wall</li>
  <li>Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee</li>
  <li>I will believe thou hast a mind that suits</li>
  <li>With this thy fair and outward character.</li>
  <li>I prithee, and I’ll pay thee bounteously,</li>
  <li class="number">Conceal me what I am, and be my aid</li>
  <li>For such disguise as haply shall become</li>
  <li>The form of my intent. I’ll serve this duke:</li>
  <li>Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him:</li>
  <li>It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing</li>
  <li class="number">And speak to him in many sorts of music</li>
  <li>That will allow me very worth his service.</li>
  <li>What else may hap to time I will commit;</li>
  <li>Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Captain">
  <li>Be you his eunuch, and your mute I’ll be:</li>
  <li class="number">When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VIOLA">
  <li>I thank thee: lead me on.</li>

<h3>SCENE III.  OLIVIA’S house.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA</div>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TOBY BELCH">
  <li>What a plague means my niece, to take the death of</li>
  <li>her brother thus? I am sure care’s an enemy to life.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARIA">
  <li>By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o’</li>
  <li>nights: your cousin, my lady, takes great</li>
  <li class="number">exceptions to your ill hours.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TOBY BELCH">
  <li>Why, let her except, before excepted.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARIA">
  <li>Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest</li>
  <li>limits of order.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TOBY BELCH">
  <li>Confine! I’ll confine myself no finer than I am:</li>
  <li class="number">these clothes are good enough to drink in; and so be</li>
  <li>these boots too: an they be not, let them hang</li>
  <li>themselves in their own straps.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARIA">
  <li>That quaffing and drinking will undo you: I heard</li>
  <li>my lady talk of it yesterday; and of a foolish</li>
  <li class="number">knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TOBY BELCH">
  <li>Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARIA">
  <li>Ay, he.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TOBY BELCH">
  <li>He’s as tall a man as any’s in Illyria.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARIA">
  <li>What’s that to the purpose?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TOBY BELCH">
  <li class="number">Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARIA">
  <li>Ay, but he’ll have but a year in all these ducats:</li>
  <li>he’s a very fool and a prodigal.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TOBY BELCH">
  <li>Fie, that you’ll say so! he plays o’ the</li>
  <li>viol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or four languages</li>
  <li class="number">word for word without book, and hath all the good</li>
  <li>gifts of nature.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARIA">
  <li>He hath indeed, almost natural: for besides that</li>
  <li>he’s a fool, he’s a great quarreller: and but that</li>
  <li>he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he</li>
  <li class="number">hath in quarrelling, ’tis thought among the prudent</li>
  <li>he would quickly have the gift of a grave.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TOBY BELCH">
  <li>By this hand, they are scoundrels and subtractors</li>
  <li>that say so of him. Who are they?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARIA">
  <li>They that add, moreover, he’s drunk nightly in your company.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TOBY BELCH">
  <li class="number">With drinking healths to my niece: I’ll drink to</li>
  <li>her as long as there is a passage in my throat and</li>
  <li>drink in Illyria: he’s a coward and a coystrill</li>
  <li>that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn</li>
  <li>o’ the toe like a parish-top. What, wench!</li>
  <li class="number">Castiliano vulgo! for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter SIR ANDREW</div>

<ol data-speaker="SIR ANDREW">
  <li>Sir Toby Belch! how now, Sir Toby Belch!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TOBY BELCH">
  <li>Sweet Sir Andrew!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR ANDREW">
  <li>Bless you, fair shrew.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARIA">
  <li>And you too, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TOBY BELCH">
  <li class="number">Accost, Sir Andrew, accost.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR ANDREW">
  <li>What’s that?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TOBY BELCH">
  <li>My niece’s chambermaid.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR ANDREW">
  <li>Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARIA">
  <li>My name is Mary, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR ANDREW">
  <li class="number">Good Mistress Mary Accost — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TOBY BELCH">
  <li>You mistake, knight; ’accost’ is front her, board</li>
  <li>her, woo her, assail her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR ANDREW">
  <li>By my troth, I would not undertake her in this</li>
  <li>company. Is that the meaning of ’accost’?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARIA">
  <li class="number">Fare you well, gentlemen.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TOBY BELCH">
  <li>An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst</li>
  <li>never draw sword again.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR ANDREW">
  <li>An you part so, mistress, I would I might never</li>
  <li>draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you have</li>
  <li class="number">fools in hand?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARIA">
  <li>Sir, I have not you by the hand.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR ANDREW">
  <li>Marry, but you shall have; and here’s my hand.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARIA">
  <li>Now, sir, ’thought is free:’ I pray you, bring</li>
  <li>your hand to the buttery-bar and let it drink.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR ANDREW">
  <li class="number">Wherefore, sweet-heart? what’s your metaphor?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARIA">
  <li>It’s dry, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR ANDREW">
  <li>Why, I think so: I am not such an ass but I can</li>
  <li>keep my hand dry. But what’s your jest?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARIA">
  <li>A dry jest, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR ANDREW">
  <li class="number">Are you full of them?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARIA">
  <li>Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers’ ends: marry,</li>
  <li>now I let go your hand, I am barren.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TOBY BELCH">
  <li>O knight thou lackest a cup of canary: when did I</li>
  <li>see thee so put down?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR ANDREW">
  <li class="number">Never in your life, I think; unless you see canary</li>
  <li>put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit</li>
  <li>than a Christian or an ordinary man has: but I am a</li>
  <li>great eater of beef and I believe that does harm to my wit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TOBY BELCH">
  <li>No question.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR ANDREW">
  <li class="number">An I thought that, I’ld forswear it. I’ll ride home</li>
  <li>to-morrow, Sir Toby.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TOBY BELCH">
  <li>Pourquoi, my dear knight?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR ANDREW">
  <li>What is ’Pourquoi’? do or not do? I would I had</li>
  <li>bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in</li>
  <li class="number">fencing, dancing and bear-baiting: O, had I but</li>
  <li>followed the arts!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TOBY BELCH">
  <li>Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR ANDREW">
  <li>Why, would that have mended my hair?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TOBY BELCH">
  <li>Past question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR ANDREW">
  <li class="number">But it becomes me well enough, does’t not?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TOBY BELCH">
  <li>Excellent; it hangs like flax on a distaff; and I</li>
  <li>hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs</li>
  <li>and spin it off.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR ANDREW">
  <li>Faith, I’ll home to-morrow, Sir Toby: your niece</li>
  <li class="number">will not be seen; or if she be, it’s four to one</li>
  <li>she’ll none of me: the count himself here hard by woos her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TOBY BELCH">
  <li>She’ll none o’ the count: she’ll not match above</li>
  <li>her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit; I</li>
  <li>have heard her swear’t. Tut, there’s life in’t,</li>
  <li class="number">man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR ANDREW">
  <li>I’ll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o’ the</li>
  <li>strangest mind i’ the world; I delight in masques</li>
  <li>and revels sometimes altogether.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TOBY BELCH">
  <li>Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR ANDREW">
  <li class="number">As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the</li>
  <li>degree of my betters; and yet I will not compare</li>
  <li>with an old man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TOBY BELCH">
  <li>What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR ANDREW">
  <li>Faith, I can cut a caper.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TOBY BELCH">
  <li class="number">And I can cut the mutton to’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR ANDREW">
  <li>And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong</li>
  <li>as any man in Illyria.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TOBY BELCH">
  <li>Wherefore are these things hid? wherefore have</li>
  <li>these gifts a curtain before ’em? are they like to</li>
  <li class="number">take dust, like Mistress Mall’s picture? why dost</li>
  <li>thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in</li>
  <li>a coranto? My very walk should be a jig; I would not</li>
  <li>so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What</li>
  <li>dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in?</li>
  <li class="number">I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy</li>
  <li>leg, it was formed under the star of a galliard.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR ANDREW">
  <li>Ay, ’tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a</li>
  <li>flame-coloured stock. Shall we set about some revels?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TOBY BELCH">
  <li>What shall we do else? were we not born under Taurus?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR ANDREW">
  <li class="number">Taurus! That’s sides and heart.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SIR TOBY BELCH">
  <li>No, sir; it is legs and thighs. Let me see the</li>
  <li>caper; ha! higher: ha, ha! excellent!</li>

  <li class="number">The parts that fortune hath bestow’d upon her,</li>
  <li>Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune;</li>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE ORSINO">
  <li>There is no woman’s sides</li>

<ol data-speaker="VIOLA">
  <li>Too well what love women to men may owe:</li>

  <li>I should your lordship.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE ORSINO">
  <li>And what’s her history?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VIOLA">
  <li class="number">A blank, my lord. She never told her love,</li>
  <li>But let concealment, like a worm i’ the bud,</li>
  <li>Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought,</li>
  <li>And with a green and yellow melancholy</li>
  <li>She sat like patience on a monument,</li>
  <li class="number">Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?</li>
  <li>We men may say more, swear more: but indeed</li>
  <li>Our shows are more than will; for still we prove</li>
  <li>Much in our vows, but little in our love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE ORSINO">
  <li>But died thy sister of her love, my boy?</li>

  <li>and in this she manifests herself to my love, and</li>
  <li>with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits</li>
  <li>of her liking. I thank my stars I am happy. I will</li>
  <li class="number">be strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and</li>
  <li>cross-gartered, even with the swiftness of putting</li>

<ol data-speaker="VIOLA">
  <li>And he is yours, and his must needs be yours:</li>
  <li>Your servant’s servant is your servant, madam.</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VIOLA">
  <li>Dear lady — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OLIVIA">
  <li>Give me leave, beseech you. I did send,</li>
  <li>After the last enchantment you did here,</li>
  <li class="number">A ring in chase of you: so did I abuse</li>
  <li>Myself, my servant and, I fear me, you:</li>
  <li>Under your hard construction must I sit,</li>
  <li>To force that on you, in a shameful cunning,</li>
  <li>Which you knew none of yours: what might you think?</li>
  <li class="number">Have you not set mine honour at the stake</li>
  <li>And baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts</li>
  <li>That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving</li>
  <li>Enough is shown: a cypress, not a bosom,</li>
  <li>Hideth my heart. So, let me hear you speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VIOLA">
  <li class="number">I pity you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OLIVIA">
  <li>That’s a degree to love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VIOLA">
  <li>No, not a grize; for ’tis a vulgar proof,</li>

  <li>Why, then, methinks ’tis time to smile again.</li>
  <li class="number">O, world, how apt the poor are to be proud!</li>

  <li>To fall before the lion than the wolf!</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Clock strikes</li>
  <li>The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.</li>
  <li>Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you:</li>
  <li class="number">And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest,</li>
  <li>Your were is alike to reap a proper man:</li>
  <li>There lies your way, due west.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VIOLA">
  <li>Then westward-ho! Grace and good disposition</li>
  <li>Attend your ladyship!</li>
  <li class="number">You’ll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OLIVIA">
  <li>Stay:</li>
  <li>I prithee, tell me what thou thinkest of me.</li>

<ol data-speaker="VIOLA">
  <li>That you do think you are not what you are.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OLIVIA">
  <li>If I think so, I think the same of you.</li>

  <li>I would you were as I would have you be!</li>

<ol data-speaker="VIOLA">
  <li>Would it be better, madam, than I am?</li>
  <li>I wish it might, for now I am your fool.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OLIVIA">
  <li>O, what a deal of scorn looks beautiful</li>
  <li class="number">In the contempt and anger of his lip!</li>
  <li>A murderous guilt shows not itself more soon</li>
  <li>Than love that would seem hid: love’s night is noon.</li>
  <li>Cesario, by the roses of the spring,</li>
  <li>By maidhood, honour, truth and every thing,</li>
  <li class="number">I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride,</li>
  <li>Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.</li>
  <li>Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,</li>
  <li>For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause,</li>
  <li>But rather reason thus with reason fetter,</li>
  <li class="number">Love sought is good, but given unsought better.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VIOLA">
  <li>By innocence I swear, and by my youth</li>
  <li>I have one heart, one bosom and one truth,</li>
  <li>And that no woman has; nor never none</li>
  <li>Shall mistress be of it, save I alone.</li>
  <li class="number">And so adieu, good madam: never more</li>
  <li>Will I my master’s tears to you deplore.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OLIVIA">
  <li>Yet come again; for thou perhaps mayst move</li>
  <li>That heart, which now abhors, to like his love.</li>

  <li class="number">Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of</li>

  <li>Go, write it in a martial hand; be curst and brief;</li>
  <li>it is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent and fun</li>

  <li>Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people;</li>
  <li>And, acting this in an obedient hope,</li>
  <li>Why have you suffer’d me to be imprison’d,</li>
  <li>Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,</li>
  <li class="number">And made the most notorious geck and gull</li>
  <li>That e’er invention play’d on? tell me why.</li>

  <li>Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,</li>
  <li>Though, I confess, much like the character</li>
  <li>But out of question ’tis Maria’s hand.</li>
  <li class="number">And now I do bethink me, it was she</li>
  <li>First told me thou wast mad; then camest in smiling,</li>
  <li>And in such forms which here were presupposed</li>
  <li>Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content:</li>
  <li>This practise hath most shrewdly pass’d upon thee;</li>
  <li class="number">But when we know the grounds and authors of it,</li>
  <li>Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge</li>
  <li>Of thine own cause.</li>

  <li>Good madam, hear me speak,</li>
  <li>And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come</li>
  <li class="number">Taint the condition of this present hour,</li>
  <li>Which I have wonder’d at. In hope it shall not,</li>
  <li>Most freely I confess, myself and Toby</li>
  <li>Set this device against Malvolio here,</li>
  <li>Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts</li>
  <li class="number">We had conceived against him: Maria writ</li>
  <li>The letter at Sir Toby’s great importance;</li>
  <li>In recompense whereof he hath married her.</li>
  <li>How with a sportful malice it was follow’d,</li>
  <li>May rather pluck on laughter than revenge;</li>
  <li class="number">If that the injuries be justly weigh’d</li>
  <li>That have on both sides pass’d.</li>

  <li>Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!</li>

<ol data-speaker="Clown">
  <li>Why, ’some are born great, some achieve greatness,</li>
  <li>and some have greatness thrown upon them.’ I was</li>
  <li class="number">one, sir, in this interlude; one Sir Topas, sir; but</li>
  <li>that’s all one. ’By the Lord, fool, I am not mad.’</li>
  <li>But do you remember? ’Madam, why laugh you at such</li>
  <li>a barren rascal? an you smile not, he’s gagged:’</li>
  <li>and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges.</li>
