<h3>SCENE I.  A hall in DUKE SOLINUS’S palace.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter DUKE SOLINUS, AEGEON, Gaoler, Officers, and other
Attendants</div>

<ol data-speaker="AEGEON">
  <li>Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall</li>
  <li>And by the doom of death end woes and all.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE SOLINUS">
  <li>Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more;</li>
  <li>I am not partial to infringe our laws:</li>
  <li class="number">The enmity and discord which of late</li>
  <li>Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke</li>
  <li>To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,</li>
  <li>Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives</li>
  <li>Have seal’d his rigorous statutes with their bloods,</li>
  <li class="number">Excludes all pity from our threatening looks.</li>
  <li>For, since the mortal and intestine jars</li>
  <li>’Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,</li>
  <li>It hath in solemn synods been decreed</li>
  <li>Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,</li>
  <li class="number">To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay, more,</li>
  <li>If any born at Ephesus be seen</li>
  <li>At any Syracusian marts and fairs;</li>
  <li>Again: if any Syracusian born</li>
  <li>Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,</li>
  <li class="number">His goods confiscate to the duke’s dispose,</li>
  <li>Unless a thousand marks be levied,</li>
  <li>To quit the penalty and to ransom him.</li>
  <li>Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,</li>
  <li>Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;</li>
  <li class="number">Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AEGEON">
  <li>Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,</li>
  <li>My woes end likewise with the evening sun.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE SOLINUS">
  <li>Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause</li>
  <li>Why thou departed’st from thy native home</li>
  <li class="number">And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AEGEON">
  <li>A heavier task could not have been imposed</li>
  <li>Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:</li>
  <li>Yet, that the world may witness that my end</li>
  <li>Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,</li>
  <li class="number">I’ll utter what my sorrows give me leave.</li>
  <li>In Syracusa was I born, and wed</li>
  <li>Unto a woman, happy but for me,</li>
  <li>And by me, had not our hap been bad.</li>
  <li>With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased</li>
  <li class="number">By prosperous voyages I often made</li>
  <li>To Epidamnum; till my factor’s death</li>
  <li>And the great care of goods at random left</li>
  <li>Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:</li>
  <li>From whom my absence was not six months old</li>
  <li class="number">Before herself, almost at fainting under</li>
  <li>The pleasing punishment that women bear,</li>
  <li>Had made provision for her following me</li>
  <li>And soon and safe arrived where I was.</li>
  <li>There had she not been long, but she became</li>
  <li class="number">A joyful mother of two goodly sons;</li>
  <li>And, which was strange, the one so like the other,</li>
  <li>As could not be distinguish’d but by names.</li>
  <li>That very hour, and in the self-same inn,</li>
  <li>A meaner woman was delivered</li>
  <li class="number">Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:</li>
  <li>Those — for their parents were exceeding poor — </li>
  <li>I bought and brought up to attend my sons.</li>
  <li>My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,</li>
  <li>Made daily motions for our home return:</li>
  <li class="number">Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,</li>
  <li>We came aboard.</li>
  <li>A league from Epidamnum had we sail’d,</li>
  <li>Before the always wind-obeying deep</li>
  <li>Gave any tragic instance of our harm:</li>
  <li class="number">But longer did we not retain much hope;</li>
  <li>For what obscured light the heavens did grant</li>
  <li>Did but convey unto our fearful minds</li>
  <li>A doubtful warrant of immediate death;</li>
  <li>Which though myself would gladly have embraced,</li>
  <li class="number">Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,</li>
  <li>Weeping before for what she saw must come,</li>
  <li>And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,</li>
  <li>That mourn’d for fashion, ignorant what to fear,</li>
  <li>Forced me to seek delays for them and me.</li>
  <li class="number">And this it was, for other means was none:</li>
  <li>The sailors sought for safety by our boat,</li>
  <li>And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:</li>
  <li>My wife, more careful for the latter-born,</li>
  <li>Had fasten’d him unto a small spare mast,</li>
  <li class="number">Such as seafaring men provide for storms;</li>
  <li>To him one of the other twins was bound,</li>
  <li>Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:</li>
  <li>The children thus disposed, my wife and I,</li>
  <li>Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix’d,</li>
  <li class="number">Fasten’d ourselves at either end the mast;</li>
  <li>And floating straight, obedient to the stream,</li>
  <li>Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.</li>
  <li>At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,</li>
  <li>Dispersed those vapours that offended us;</li>
  <li class="number">And by the benefit of his wished light,</li>
  <li>The seas wax’d calm, and we discovered</li>
  <li>Two ships from far making amain to us,</li>
  <li>Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:</li>
  <li>But ere they came — O, let me say no more!</li>
  <li class="number">Gather the sequel by that went before.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE SOLINUS">
  <li>Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;</li>
  <li>For we may pity, though not pardon thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AEGEON">
  <li>O, had the gods done so, I had not now</li>
  <li>Worthily term’d them merciless to us!</li>
  <li class="number">For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,</li>
  <li>We were encounterd by a mighty rock;</li>
  <li>Which being violently borne upon,</li>
  <li>Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;</li>
  <li>So that, in this unjust divorce of us,</li>
  <li class="number">Fortune had left to both of us alike</li>
  <li>What to delight in, what to sorrow for.</li>
  <li>Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened</li>
  <li>With lesser weight but not with lesser woe,</li>
  <li>Was carried with more speed before the wind;</li>
  <li class="number">And in our sight they three were taken up</li>
  <li>By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.</li>
  <li>At length, another ship had seized on us;</li>
  <li>And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,</li>
  <li>Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck’d guests;</li>
  <li class="number">And would have reft the fishers of their prey,</li>
  <li>Had not their bark been very slow of sail;</li>
  <li>And therefore homeward did they bend their course.</li>
  <li>Thus have you heard me sever’d from my bliss;</li>
  <li>That by misfortunes was my life prolong’d,</li>
  <li class="number">To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE SOLINUS">
  <li>And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,</li>
  <li>Do me the favour to dilate at full</li>
  <li>What hath befall’n of them and thee till now.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AEGEON">
  <li>My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,</li>
  <li class="number">At eighteen years became inquisitive</li>
  <li>After his brother: and importuned me</li>
  <li>That his attendant — so his case was like,</li>
  <li>Reft of his brother, but retain’d his name — </li>
  <li>Might bear him company in the quest of him:</li>
  <li class="number">Whom whilst I labour’d of a love to see,</li>
  <li>I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.</li>
  <li>Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,</li>
  <li>Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,</li>
  <li>And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;</li>
  <li class="number">Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought</li>
  <li>Or that or any place that harbours men.</li>
  <li>But here must end the story of my life;</li>
  <li>And happy were I in my timely death,</li>
  <li>Could all my travels warrant me they live.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE SOLINUS">
  <li class="number">Hapless AEgeon, whom the fates have mark’d</li>
  <li>To bear the extremity of dire mishap!</li>
  <li>Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,</li>
  <li>Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,</li>
  <li>Which princes, would they, may not disannul,</li>
  <li class="number">My soul would sue as advocate for thee.</li>
  <li>But, though thou art adjudged to the death</li>
  <li>And passed sentence may not be recall’d</li>
  <li>But to our honour’s great disparagement,</li>
  <li>Yet I will favour thee in what I can.</li>
  <li class="number">Therefore, merchant, I’ll limit thee this day</li>
  <li>To seek thy life by beneficial help:</li>
  <li>Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;</li>
  <li>Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,</li>
  <li>And live; if no, then thou art doom’d to die.</li>
  <li class="number">Gaoler, take him to thy custody.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Gaoler">
  <li>I will, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AEGEON">
  <li>Hopeless and helpless doth AEgeon wend,</li>
  <li>But to procrastinate his lifeless end.</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  The Mart.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse, DROMIO of Syracuse,

<ol data-speaker="First Merchant">
  <li>Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum,</li>
  <li>Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.</li>
  <li>This very day a Syracusian merchant</li>
  <li>Is apprehended for arrival here;</li>
  <li class="number">And not being able to buy out his life</li>
  <li>According to the statute of the town,</li>
  <li>Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.</li>
  <li>There is your money that I had to keep.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,</li>
  <li class="number">And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.</li>
  <li>Within this hour it will be dinner-time:</li>
  <li>Till that, I’ll view the manners of the town,</li>
  <li>Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,</li>
  <li>And then return and sleep within mine inn,</li>
  <li class="number">For with long travel I am stiff and weary.</li>
  <li>Get thee away.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Many a man would take you at your word,</li>
  <li>And go indeed, having so good a mean.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,</li>

  <li>Lightens my humour with his merry jests.</li>
  <li>What, will you walk with me about the town,</li>
  <li>And then go to my inn and dine with me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Merchant">
  <li>I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,</li>

  <li>I crave your pardon. Soon at five o’clock,</li>
  <li>Please you, I’ll meet with you upon the mart</li>

  <li>My present business calls me from you now.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li class="number">Farewell till then: I will go lose myself</li>
  <li>And wander up and down to view the city.</li>

  <li>Sir, I commend you to your own content.</li>

  <li>He that commends me to mine own content</li>
  <li>Commends me to the thing I cannot get.</li>

  <li>That in the ocean seeks another drop,</li>
  <li>Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,</li>
  <li>Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself:</li>

  <li class="number">In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter DROMIO of Ephesus</li>
  <li>Here comes the almanac of my true date.</li>
  <li>What now? how chance thou art return’d so soon?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF EPHESUS">
  <li>Return’d so soon! rather approach’d too late:</li>
  <li>The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit,</li>
  <li class="number">The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;</li>
  <li>My mistress made it one upon my cheek:</li>
  <li>She is so hot because the meat is cold;</li>
  <li>The meat is cold because you come not home;</li>
  <li>You come not home because you have no stomach;</li>
  <li class="number">You have no stomach having broke your fast;</li>
  <li>But we that know what ’tis to fast and pray</li>
  <li>Are penitent for your default to-day.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Stop in your wind, sir: tell me this, I pray:</li>
  <li>Where have you left the money that I gave you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF EPHESUS">
  <li class="number">O — sixpence, that I had o’ Wednesday last</li>
  <li>To pay the saddler for my mistress’ crupper?</li>
  <li>The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>I am not in a sportive humour now:</li>

  <li>If I return, I shall be post indeed,</li>
  <li class="number">For she will score your fault upon my pate.</li>
  <li>Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,</li>
  <li>And strike you home without a messenger.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season;</li>
  <li>Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.</li>
  <li class="number">Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF EPHESUS">
  <li>To me, sir? why, you gave no gold to me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,</li>
  <li>And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF EPHESUS">
  <li>My charge was but to fetch you from the mart</li>
  <li class="number">Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner:</li>
  <li>My mistress and her sister stays for you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>In what safe place you have bestow’d my money,</li>
  <li>Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours</li>
  <li>That stands on tricks when I am undisposed:</li>
  <li class="number">Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF EPHESUS">
  <li>I have some marks of yours upon my pate,</li>
  <li>Some of my mistress’ marks upon my shoulders,</li>
  <li>But not a thousand marks between you both.</li>
  <li>If I should pay your worship those again,</li>
  <li class="number">Perchance you will not bear them patiently.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Thy mistress’ marks? what mistress, slave, hast thou?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF EPHESUS">
  <li>Your worship’s wife, my mistress at the Phoenix;</li>
  <li>She that doth fast till you come home to dinner,</li>
  <li>And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li class="number">What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,</li>
  <li>Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.</li>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF EPHESUS">
  <li>What mean you, sir? for God’s sake, hold your hands!</li>
  <li>Nay, and you will not, sir, I’ll take my heels.</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA</div>

<ol data-speaker="ADRIANA">
  <li>Neither my husband nor the slave return’d,</li>
  <li>That in such haste I sent to seek his master!</li>
  <li>Sure, Luciana, it is two o’clock.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIANA">
  <li>Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,</li>

  <li>Good sister, let us dine and never fret:</li>
  <li>A man is master of his liberty:</li>
  <li>Time is their master, and, when they see time,</li>
  <li>They’ll go or come: if so, be patient, sister.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ADRIANA">
  <li class="number">Why should their liberty than ours be more?</li>

  <li class="number">Men, more divine, the masters of all these,</li>
  <li>Lords of the wide world and wild watery seas,</li>

  <li class="number">How if your husband start some other where?</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  A public place.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse</div>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up</li>
  <li>Safe at the Centaur; and the heedful slave</li>
  <li>Is wander’d forth, in care to seek me out</li>
  <li>By computation and mine host’s report.</li>
  <li class="number">I could not speak with Dromio since at first</li>
  <li>I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter DROMIO of Syracuse</li>
  <li>How now sir! is your merry humour alter’d?</li>
  <li>As you love strokes, so jest with me again.</li>
  <li>You know no Centaur? you received no gold?</li>
  <li class="number">Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?</li>
  <li>My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,</li>
  <li>That thus so madly thou didst answer me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>What answer, sir? when spake I such a word?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Even now, even here, not half an hour since.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li class="number">I did not see you since you sent me hence,</li>
  <li>Home to the Centaur, with the gold you gave me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Villain, thou didst deny the gold’s receipt,</li>
  <li>And told’st me of a mistress and a dinner;</li>
  <li>For which, I hope, thou felt’st I was displeased.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li class="number">I am glad to see you in this merry vein:</li>
  <li>What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?</li>
  <li>Think’st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Beating him</div>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Hold, sir, for God’s sake! now your jest is earnest:</li>
  <li class="number">Upon what bargain do you give it me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Because that I familiarly sometimes</li>
  <li>Do use you for my fool and chat with you,</li>
  <li>Your sauciness will jest upon my love</li>
  <li>And make a common of my serious hours.</li>
  <li class="number">When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,</li>
  <li>But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.</li>
  <li>If you will jest with me, know my aspect,</li>
  <li>And fashion your demeanor to my looks,</li>
  <li>Or I will beat this method in your sconce.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li class="number">Sconce call you it? so you would leave battering, I</li>
  <li>had rather have it a head: an you use these blows</li>
  <li>long, I must get a sconce for my head and ensconce</li>
  <li>it too; or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders.</li>
  <li>But, I pray, sir why am I beaten?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li class="number">Dost thou not know?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Shall I tell you why?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say every why hath</li>
  <li>a wherefore.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li class="number">Why, first — for flouting me; and then, wherefore — </li>
  <li>For urging it the second time to me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,</li>
  <li>When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme</li>
  <li>nor reason?</li>
  <li class="number">Well, sir, I thank you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Thank me, sir, for what?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>I’ll make you amends next, to give you nothing for</li>
  <li>something. But say, sir, is it dinner-time?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li class="number">No, sir; I think the meat wants that I have.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>In good time, sir; what’s that?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Basting.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Well, sir, then ’twill be dry.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>If it be, sir, I pray you, eat none of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li class="number">Your reason?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another</li>
  <li>dry basting.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Well, sir, learn to jest in good time: there’s a</li>
  <li>time for all things.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li class="number">I durst have denied that, before you were so choleric.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>By what rule, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald</li>
  <li>pate of father Time himself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Let’s hear it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li class="number">There’s no time for a man to recover his hair that</li>
  <li>grows bald by nature.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>May he not do it by fine and recovery?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the</li>
  <li>lost hair of another man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li class="number">Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is,</li>
  <li>so plentiful an excrement?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts;</li>
  <li>and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Why, but there’s many a man hath more hair than wit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li class="number">Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>The plainer dealer, the sooner lost: yet he loseth</li>
  <li>it in a kind of jollity.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>For what reason?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li class="number">For two; and sound ones too.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Nay, not sound, I pray you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Sure ones, then.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Certain ones then.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li class="number">Name them.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>The one, to save the money that he spends in</li>
  <li>trimming; the other, that at dinner they should not</li>
  <li>drop in his porridge.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>You would all this time have proved there is no</li>
  <li class="number">time for all things.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover hair</li>
  <li>lost by nature.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>But your reason was not substantial, why there is no</li>
  <li>time to recover.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li class="number">Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald and therefore</li>
  <li>to the world’s end will have bald followers.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>I knew ’twould be a bald conclusion:</li>
  <li>But, soft! who wafts us yonder?</li>
</ol>

  <li>And may it be that you have quite forgot</li>
  <li>A husband’s office? shall, Antipholus.</li>
  <li>Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?</li>
  <li>Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?</li>
  <li class="number">If you did wed my sister for her wealth,</li>
  <li>Then for her wealth’s sake use her with more kindness:</li>
  <li>Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;</li>
  <li>Muffle your false love with some show of blindness:</li>
  <li>Let not my sister read it in your eye;</li>
  <li class="number">Be not thy tongue thy own shame’s orator;</li>
  <li>Look sweet, be fair, become disloyalty;</li>
  <li>Apparel vice like virtue’s harbinger;</li>
  <li>Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;</li>
  <li>Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;</li>
  <li class="number">Be secret-false: what need she be acquainted?</li>
  <li>What simple thief brags of his own attaint?</li>
  <li>’Tis double wrong, to truant with your bed</li>
  <li>And let her read it in thy looks at board:</li>
  <li>Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;</li>
  <li class="number">Ill deeds are doubled with an evil word.</li>
  <li>Alas, poor women! make us but believe,</li>
  <li>Being compact of credit, that you love us;</li>
  <li>Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;</li>
  <li>We in your motion turn and you may move us.</li>
  <li class="number">Then, gentle brother, get you in again;</li>
  <li>Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife:</li>
  <li>’Tis holy sport to be a little vain,</li>
  <li>When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Sweet mistress — what your name is else, I know not,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine — </li>
  <li>Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not</li>
  <li>Than our earth’s wonder, more than earth divine.</li>
  <li>Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak;</li>
  <li>Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,</li>
  <li class="number">Smother’d in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,</li>
  <li>The folded meaning of your words’ deceit.</li>
  <li>Against my soul’s pure truth why labour you</li>
  <li>To make it wander in an unknown field?</li>
  <li>Are you a god? would you create me new?</li>
  <li class="number">Transform me then, and to your power I’ll yield.</li>
  <li>But if that I am I, then well I know</li>
  <li>Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,</li>
  <li>Nor to her bed no homage do I owe</li>
  <li>Far more, far more to you do I decline.</li>
  <li class="number">O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,</li>
  <li>To drown me in thy sister’s flood of tears:</li>
  <li>Sing, siren, for thyself and I will dote:</li>
  <li>Spread o’er the silver waves thy golden hairs,</li>
  <li>And as a bed I’ll take them and there lie,</li>
  <li class="number">And in that glorious supposition think</li>
  <li>He gains by death that hath such means to die:</li>
  <li>Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.</li>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIANA">
  <li class="number">It is a fault that springeth from your eye.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">

  <li>My sole earth’s heaven and my heaven’s claim.</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li class="number">Do you know me, sir? am I Dromio? am I your man?</li>
  <li>am I myself?</li>

  <li>I am an ass, I am a woman’s man and besides myself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Marry, sir, besides myself, I am due to a woman; one</li>
  <li class="number">that claims me, one that haunts me, one that will have me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>What claim lays she to thee?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Marry sir, such claim as you would lay to your</li>

  <li>being a beast, she would have me; but that she,</li>
  <li class="number">being a very beastly creature, lays claim to me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>What is she?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>A very reverent body; ay, such a one as a man may</li>
  <li>not speak of without he say ’Sir-reverence.’ I have</li>
  <li>but lean luck in the match, and yet is she a</li>
  <li class="number">wondrous fat marriage.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>How dost thou mean a fat marriage?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Marry, sir, she’s the kitchen wench and all grease;</li>
  <li>and I know not what use to put her to but to make a</li>
  <li>lamp of her and run from her by her own light. I</li>
  <li class="number">warrant, her rags and the tallow in them will burn a</li>
  <li>Poland winter: if she lives till doomsday,</li>
  <li>she’ll burn a week longer than the whole world.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>What complexion is she of?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Swart, like my shoe, but her face nothing half so</li>
  <li class="number">clean kept: for why, she sweats; a man may go over</li>
  <li>shoes in the grime of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>That’s a fault that water will mend.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>No, sir, ’tis in grain; Noah’s flood could not do it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>What’s her name?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li class="number">Nell, sir; but her name and three quarters, that’s</li>
  <li>an ell and three quarters, will not measure her from</li>
  <li>hip to hip.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Then she bears some breadth?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip:</li>
  <li class="number">she is spherical, like a globe; I could find out</li>
  <li>countries in her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>In what part of her body stands Ireland?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Marry, in her buttocks: I found it out by the bogs.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Where Scotland?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li class="number">I found it by the barrenness; hard in the palm of the hand.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Where France?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>In her forehead; armed and reverted, making war</li>
  <li>against her heir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Where England?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li class="number">I looked for the chalky cliffs, but I could find no</li>
  <li>whiteness in them; but I guess it stood in her chin,</li>
  <li>by the salt rheum that ran between France and it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Where Spain?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Faith, I saw it not; but I felt it hot in her breath.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li class="number">Where America, the Indies?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Oh, sir, upon her nose all o’er embellished with</li>
  <li>rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich</li>
  <li>aspect to the hot breath of Spain; who sent whole</li>
  <li>armadoes of caracks to be ballast at her nose.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li class="number">Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Oh, sir, I did not look so low. To conclude, this</li>
  <li>drudge, or diviner, laid claim to me, call’d me</li>
  <li>Dromio; swore I was assured to her; told me what</li>
  <li>privy marks I had about me, as, the mark of my</li>
  <li class="number">shoulder, the mole in my neck, the great wart on my</li>
  <li>left arm, that I amazed ran from her as a witch:</li>
  <li>And, I think, if my breast had not been made of</li>
  <li>faith and my heart of steel,</li>
  <li>She had transform’d me to a curtal dog and made</li>
  <li class="number">me turn i’ the wheel.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>Go hie thee presently, post to the road:</li>
  <li>An if the wind blow any way from shore,</li>
  <li>I will not harbour in this town to-night:</li>
  <li>If any bark put forth, come to the mart,</li>
  <li class="number">Where I will walk till thou return to me.</li>
  <li>If every one knows us and we know none,</li>
  <li>’Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack and be gone.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF SYRACUSE">
  <li>As from a bear a man would run for life,</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

  <li>Possess’d with such a gentle sovereign grace,</li>
  <li class="number">Of such enchanting presence and discourse,</li>

  <li class="number">At your important letters — this ill day</li>
  <li>A most outrageous fit of madness took him;</li>
  <li>That desperately he hurried through the street,</li>
  <li>With him his bondman, all as mad as he — </li>
  <li>Doing displeasure to the citizens</li>
  <li class="number">By rushing in their houses, bearing thence</li>
  <li>Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.</li>
  <li>Once did I get him bound and sent him home,</li>
  <li>Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went,</li>
  <li>That here and there his fury had committed.</li>
  <li class="number">Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,</li>
  <li>He broke from those that had the guard of him;</li>
  <li>And with his mad attendant and himself,</li>
  <li>Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,</li>
  <li>Met us again and madly bent on us,</li>
  <li class="number">Chased us away; till, raising of more aid,</li>
  <li>We came again to bind them. Then they fled</li>
  <li>Into this abbey, whither we pursued them:</li>
  <li>And here the abbess shuts the gates on us</li>
  <li>And will not suffer us to fetch him out,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.</li>
  <li>Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command</li>
  <li>Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE SOLINUS">
  <li>Long since thy husband served me in my wars,</li>

  <li>Go, some of you, knock at the abbey-gate</li>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS">
  <li>My liege, I am advised what I say,</li>
  <li>Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,</li>
  <li>Nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire,</li>
  <li>Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.</li>
  <li class="number">This woman lock’d me out this day from dinner:</li>
  <li>That goldsmith there, were he not pack’d with her,</li>
  <li>Could witness it, for he was with me then;</li>
  <li>Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,</li>
  <li>Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,</li>
  <li class="number">Where Balthazar and I did dine together.</li>
  <li>Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,</li>
  <li>I went to seek him: in the street I met him</li>
  <li>And in his company that gentleman.</li>
  <li>There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down</li>
  <li class="number">That I this day of him received the chain,</li>
  <li>Which, God he knows, I saw not: for the which</li>
  <li>He did arrest me with an officer.</li>
  <li>I did obey, and sent my peasant home</li>
  <li>For certain ducats: he with none return’d</li>
  <li class="number">Then fairly I bespoke the officer</li>
  <li>To go in person with me to my house.</li>
  <li>By the way we met</li>
  <li>My wife, her sister, and a rabble more</li>
  <li>Of vile confederates. Along with them</li>
  <li class="number">They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-faced villain,</li>
  <li>A mere anatomy, a mountebank,</li>
  <li>A threadbare juggler and a fortune-teller,</li>
  <li>A needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch,</li>
  <li>A dead-looking man: this pernicious slave,</li>
  <li class="number">Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,</li>
  <li>And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,</li>
  <li>And with no face, as ’twere, outfacing me,</li>
  <li>Cries out, I was possess’d. Then all together</li>
  <li>They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence</li>
  <li class="number">And in a dark and dankish vault at home</li>
  <li>There left me and my man, both bound together;</li>
  <li>Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,</li>
  <li>I gain’d my freedom, and immediately</li>
  <li>Ran hither to your grace; whom I beseech</li>
  <li class="number">To give me ample satisfaction</li>
  <li>For these deep shames and great indignities.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li>My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,</li>
  <li>That he dined not at home, but was lock’d out.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE SOLINUS">
  <li>But had he such a chain of thee or no?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANGELO">
  <li class="number">He had, my lord: and when he ran in here,</li>
  <li>These people saw the chain about his neck.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Second Merchant">
  <li>Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine</li>
  <li>Heard you confess you had the chain of him</li>
  <li>After you first forswore it on the mart:</li>
  <li class="number">And thereupon I drew my sword on you;</li>
  <li>And then you fled into this abbey here,</li>
  <li>From whence, I think, you are come by miracle.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS">
  <li>I never came within these abbey-walls,</li>
  <li>Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me:</li>
  <li class="number">I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven!</li>
  <li>And this is false you burden me withal.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE SOLINUS">
  <li>Why, what an intricate impeach is this!</li>
  <li>I think you all have drunk of Circe’s cup.</li>
  <li>If here you housed him, here he would have been;</li>
  <li class="number">If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly:</li>
  <li>You say he dined at home; the goldsmith here</li>
  <li>Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DROMIO OF EPHESUS">
  <li>Sir, he dined with her there, at the Porpentine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Courtezan">
  <li>He did, and from my finger snatch’d that ring.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS">
  <li class="number">’Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE SOLINUS">

<ol data-speaker="DUKE SOLINUS">
