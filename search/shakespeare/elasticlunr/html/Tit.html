<h3>SCENE I.  Rome. Before the Capitol.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">The Tomb of the ANDRONICI appearing; the Tribunes
and Senators aloft. Enter, below, from one side,
SATURNINUS and his Followers; and, from the other
side, BASSIANUS and his Followers; with drum and colours</div>

<ol data-speaker="SATURNINUS">
  <li>Noble patricians, patrons of my right,</li>
  <li>Defend the justice of my cause with arms,</li>
  <li>And, countrymen, my loving followers,</li>
  <li>Plead my successive title with your swords:</li>
  <li class="number">I am his first-born son, that was the last</li>
  <li>That wore the imperial diadem of Rome;</li>
  <li>Then let my father’s honours live in me,</li>
  <li>Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSIANUS">
  <li>Romans, friends, followers, favorers of my right,</li>
  <li class="number">If ever Bassianus, Caesar’s son,</li>
  <li>Were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome,</li>
  <li>Keep then this passage to the Capitol</li>
  <li>And suffer not dishonour to approach</li>
  <li>The imperial seat, to virtue consecrate,</li>
  <li class="number">To justice, continence and nobility;</li>
  <li>But let desert in pure election shine,</li>
  <li>And, Romans, fight for freedom in your choice.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter MARCUS ANDRONICUS, aloft, with the crown</div>

<ol data-speaker="MARCUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>Princes, that strive by factions and by friends</li>
  <li>Ambitiously for rule and empery,</li>
  <li class="number">Know that the people of Rome, for whom we stand</li>
  <li>A special party, have, by common voice,</li>
  <li>In election for the Roman empery,</li>
  <li>Chosen Andronicus, surnamed Pius</li>
  <li>For many good and great deserts to Rome:</li>
  <li class="number">A nobler man, a braver warrior,</li>
  <li>Lives not this day within the city walls:</li>
  <li>He by the senate is accit’d home</li>
  <li>From weary wars against the barbarous Goths;</li>
  <li>That, with his sons, a terror to our foes,</li>
  <li class="number">Hath yoked a nation strong, train’d up in arms.</li>
  <li>Ten years are spent since first he undertook</li>
  <li>This cause of Rome and chastised with arms</li>
  <li>Our enemies’ pride: five times he hath return’d</li>
  <li>Bleeding to Rome, bearing his valiant sons</li>
  <li class="number">In coffins from the field;</li>
  <li>And now at last, laden with horror’s spoils,</li>
  <li>Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,</li>
  <li>Renowned Titus, flourishing in arms.</li>
  <li>Let us entreat, by honour of his name,</li>
  <li class="number">Whom worthily you would have now succeed.</li>
  <li>And in the Capitol and senate’s right,</li>
  <li>Whom you pretend to honour and adore,</li>
  <li>That you withdraw you and abate your strength;</li>
  <li>Dismiss your followers and, as suitors should,</li>
  <li class="number">Plead your deserts in peace and humbleness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SATURNINUS">
  <li>How fair the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSIANUS">
  <li>Marcus Andronicus, so I do ally</li>
  <li>In thy uprightness and integrity,</li>
  <li>And so I love and honour thee and thine,</li>
  <li class="number">Thy noble brother Titus and his sons,</li>
  <li>And her to whom my thoughts are humbled all,</li>
  <li>Gracious Lavinia, Rome’s rich ornament,</li>
  <li>That I will here dismiss my loving friends,</li>
  <li>And to my fortunes and the people’s favor</li>
  <li class="number">Commit my cause in balance to be weigh’d.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt the followers of BASSIANUS</div>

<ol data-speaker="SATURNINUS">
  <li>Friends, that have been thus forward in my right,</li>
  <li>I thank you all and here dismiss you all,</li>
  <li>And to the love and favor of my country</li>
  <li>Commit myself, my person and the cause.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exeunt the followers of SATURNINUS</li>
  <li class="number">Rome, be as just and gracious unto me</li>
  <li>As I am confident and kind to thee.</li>
  <li>Open the gates, and let me in.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSIANUS">
  <li>Tribunes, and me, a poor competitor.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Flourish. SATURNINUS and BASSIANUS go up into the Capitol</div>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter a Captain</div>

<ol data-speaker="Captain">
  <li>Romans, make way: the good Andronicus.</li>
  <li class="number">Patron of virtue, Rome’s best champion,</li>
  <li>Successful in the battles that he fights,</li>
  <li>With honour and with fortune is return’d</li>
  <li>From where he circumscribed with his sword,</li>
  <li>And brought to yoke, the enemies of Rome.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Drums and trumpets sounded. Enter MARTIUS and
MUTIUS; After them, two Men bearing a coffin
covered with black; then LUCIUS and QUINTUS. After
them, TITUS ANDRONICUS; and then TAMORA, with
ALARBUS, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON, AARON, and other Goths,
prisoners; Soldiers and people following. The
Bearers set down the coffin, and TITUS speaks</div>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li class="number">Hail, Rome, victorious in thy mourning weeds!</li>
  <li>Lo, as the bark, that hath discharged her fraught,</li>
  <li>Returns with precious jading to the bay</li>
  <li>From whence at first she weigh’d her anchorage,</li>
  <li>Cometh Andronicus, bound with laurel boughs,</li>
  <li class="number">To re-salute his country with his tears,</li>
  <li>Tears of true joy for his return to Rome.</li>
  <li>Thou great defender of this Capitol,</li>
  <li>Stand gracious to the rites that we intend!</li>
  <li>Romans, of five and twenty valiant sons,</li>
  <li class="number">Half of the number that King Priam had,</li>
  <li>Behold the poor remains, alive and dead!</li>
  <li>These that survive let Rome reward with love;</li>
  <li>These that I bring unto their latest home,</li>
  <li>With burial amongst their ancestors:</li>
  <li class="number">Here Goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword.</li>
  <li>Titus, unkind and careless of thine own,</li>
  <li>Why suffer’st thou thy sons, unburied yet,</li>
  <li>To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx?</li>
  <li>Make way to lay them by their brethren.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">The tomb is opened</li>
  <li class="number">There greet in silence, as the dead are wont,</li>
  <li>And sleep in peace, slain in your country’s wars!</li>
  <li>O sacred receptacle of my joys,</li>
  <li>Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,</li>
  <li>How many sons of mine hast thou in store,</li>
  <li class="number">That thou wilt never render to me more!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIUS">
  <li>Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths,</li>
  <li>That we may hew his limbs, and on a pile</li>
  <li>Ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh,</li>
  <li>Before this earthy prison of their bones;</li>
  <li class="number">That so the shadows be not unappeased,</li>
  <li>Nor we disturb’d with prodigies on earth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>I give him you, the noblest that survives,</li>
  <li>The eldest son of this distressed queen.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TAMORA">
  <li>Stay, Roman brethren! Gracious conqueror,</li>
  <li class="number">Victorious Titus, rue the tears I shed,</li>
  <li>A mother’s tears in passion for her son:</li>
  <li>And if thy sons were ever dear to thee,</li>
  <li>O, think my son to be as dear to me!</li>
  <li>Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome,</li>
  <li class="number">To beautify thy triumphs and return,</li>
  <li>Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke,</li>
  <li>But must my sons be slaughter’d in the streets,</li>
  <li>For valiant doings in their country’s cause?</li>
  <li>O, if to fight for king and commonweal</li>
  <li class="number">Were piety in thine, it is in these.</li>
  <li>Andronicus, stain not thy tomb with blood:</li>
  <li>Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods?</li>
  <li>Draw near them then in being merciful:</li>
  <li>Sweet mercy is nobility’s true badge:</li>
  <li class="number">Thrice noble Titus, spare my first-born son.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>Patient yourself, madam, and pardon me.</li>
  <li>These are their brethren, whom you Goths beheld</li>
  <li>Alive and dead, and for their brethren slain</li>
  <li>Religiously they ask a sacrifice:</li>
  <li class="number">To this your son is mark’d, and die he must,</li>
  <li>To appease their groaning shadows that are gone.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIUS">
  <li>Away with him! and make a fire straight;</li>
  <li>And with our swords, upon a pile of wood,</li>
  <li>Let’s hew his limbs till they be clean consumed.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt LUCIUS, QUINTUS, MARTIUS, and MUTIUS, with ALARBUS</div>

<ol data-speaker="TAMORA">
  <li class="number">O cruel, irreligious piety!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CHIRON">
  <li>Was ever Scythia half so barbarous?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DEMETRIUS">
  <li>Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome.</li>
  <li>Alarbus goes to rest; and we survive</li>
  <li>To tremble under Titus’ threatening looks.</li>
  <li class="number">Then, madam, stand resolved, but hope withal</li>
  <li>The self-same gods that arm’d the Queen of Troy</li>
  <li>With opportunity of sharp revenge</li>
  <li>Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent,</li>
  <li>May favor Tamora, the Queen of Goths — </li>
  <li class="number">When Goths were Goths and Tamora was queen — </li>
  <li>To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Re-enter LUCIUS, QUINTUS, MARTIUS and MUTIUS, with
their swords bloody</div>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIUS">
  <li>See, lord and father, how we have perform’d</li>
  <li>Our Roman rites: Alarbus’ limbs are lopp’d,</li>
  <li>And entrails feed the sacrificing fire,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose smoke, like incense, doth perfume the sky.</li>
  <li>Remaineth nought, but to inter our brethren,</li>
  <li>And with loud ’larums welcome them to Rome.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>Let it be so; and let Andronicus</li>
  <li>Make this his latest farewell to their souls.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Trumpets sounded, and the coffin laid in the tomb</li>
  <li class="number">In peace and honour rest you here, my sons;</li>
  <li>Rome’s readiest champions, repose you here in rest,</li>
  <li>Secure from worldly chances and mishaps!</li>
  <li>Here lurks no treason, here no envy swells,</li>
  <li>Here grow no damned grudges; here are no storms,</li>
  <li class="number">No noise, but silence and eternal sleep:</li>
  <li>In peace and honour rest you here, my sons!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter LAVINIA</div>

<ol data-speaker="LAVINIA">
  <li>In peace and honour live Lord Titus long;</li>
  <li>My noble lord and father, live in fame!</li>
  <li>Lo, at this tomb my tributary tears</li>
  <li class="number">I render, for my brethren’s obsequies;</li>
  <li>And at thy feet I kneel, with tears of joy,</li>
  <li>Shed on the earth, for thy return to Rome:</li>
  <li>O, bless me here with thy victorious hand,</li>
  <li>Whose fortunes Rome’s best citizens applaud!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li class="number">Kind Rome, that hast thus lovingly reserved</li>
  <li>The cordial of mine age to glad my heart!</li>
  <li>Lavinia, live; outlive thy father’s days,</li>
  <li>And fame’s eternal date, for virtue’s praise!</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter, below, MARCUS ANDRONICUS and Tribunes;

<ol data-speaker="MARCUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>Long live Lord Titus, my beloved brother,</li>
  <li class="number">Gracious triumpher in the eyes of Rome!</li>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>Thanks, gentle tribune, noble brother Marcus.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>And welcome, nephews, from successful wars,</li>
  <li>You that survive, and you that sleep in fame!</li>
  <li>Fair lords, your fortunes are alike in all,</li>
  <li class="number">That in your country’s service drew your swords:</li>
  <li>But safer triumph is this funeral pomp,</li>
  <li>That hath aspired to Solon’s happiness</li>
  <li>And triumphs over chance in honour’s bed.</li>
  <li>Titus Andronicus, the people of Rome,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose friend in justice thou hast ever been,</li>
  <li>Send thee by me, their tribune and their trust,</li>
  <li>This palliament of white and spotless hue;</li>
  <li>And name thee in election for the empire,</li>
  <li>With these our late-deceased emperor’s sons:</li>
  <li class="number">Be candidatus then, and put it on,</li>
  <li>And help to set a head on headless Rome.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>A better head her glorious body fits</li>
  <li>Than his that shakes for age and feebleness:</li>
  <li>What should I don this robe, and trouble you?</li>
  <li class="number">Be chosen with proclamations to-day,</li>
  <li>To-morrow yield up rule, resign my life,</li>
  <li>And set abroad new business for you all?</li>
  <li>Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,</li>
  <li>And led my country’s strength successfully,</li>
  <li class="number">And buried one and twenty valiant sons,</li>
  <li>Knighted in field, slain manfully in arms,</li>
  <li>In right and service of their noble country</li>
  <li>Give me a staff of honour for mine age,</li>
  <li>But not a sceptre to control the world:</li>
  <li class="number">Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>Titus, thou shalt obtain and ask the empery.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SATURNINUS">
  <li>Proud and ambitious tribune, canst thou tell?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>Patience, Prince Saturninus.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SATURNINUS">
  <li>Romans, do me right:</li>
  <li class="number">Patricians, draw your swords: and sheathe them not</li>
  <li>Till Saturninus be Rome’s emperor.</li>
  <li>Andronicus, would thou wert shipp’d to hell,</li>
  <li>Rather than rob me of the people’s hearts!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIUS">
  <li>Proud Saturnine, interrupter of the good</li>

  <li>The people’s hearts, and wean them from themselves.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASSIANUS">
  <li>Andronicus, I do not flatter thee,</li>
  <li>But honour thee, and will do till I die:</li>
  <li class="number">My faction if thou strengthen with thy friends,</li>
  <li>I will most thankful be; and thanks to men</li>
  <li>Of noble minds is honourable meed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>People of Rome, and people’s tribunes here,</li>
  <li>I ask your voices and your suffrages:</li>
  <li class="number">Will you bestow them friendly on Andronicus?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Tribunes">
  <li>To gratify the good Andronicus,</li>
  <li>And gratulate his safe return to Rome,</li>
  <li>The people will accept whom he admits.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>Tribunes, I thank you: and this suit I make,</li>
  <li class="number">That you create your emperor’s eldest son,</li>
  <li>Lord Saturnine; whose virtues will, I hope,</li>
  <li>Reflect on Rome as Titan’s rays on earth,</li>
  <li>And ripen justice in this commonweal:</li>
  <li>Then, if you will elect by my advice,</li>
  <li class="number">Crown him and say ’Long live our emperor!’</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCUS ANDRONICUS">

  <li class="number">Thy name and honourable family,</li>

<ol data-speaker="SATURNINUS">
  <li>Thanks, noble Titus, father of my life!</li>

  <li>Now climbeth Tamora Olympus’ top,</li>

  <li>So Tamora:</li>
  <li class="number">Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait,</li>
  <li>And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown.</li>
  <li>Then, Aaron, arm thy heart, and fit thy thoughts,</li>
  <li>To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress,</li>
  <li>And mount her pitch, whom thou in triumph long</li>
  <li class="number">Hast prisoner held, fetter’d in amorous chains</li>
  <li>And faster bound to Aaron’s charming eyes</li>
  <li>Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus.</li>
  <li>Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts!</li>
  <li>I will be bright, and shine in pearl and gold,</li>
  <li class="number">To wait upon this new-made empress.</li>
  <li>To wait, said I? to wanton with this queen,</li>
  <li>This goddess, this Semiramis, this nymph,</li>
  <li>This siren, that will charm Rome’s Saturnine,</li>
  <li>And see his shipwreck and his commonweal’s.</li>

<ol data-speaker="DEMETRIUS">
  <li>Why, boy, although our mother, unadvised,</li>
  <li class="number">Gave you a dancing-rapier by your side,</li>

  <li>So near the emperor’s palace dare you draw,</li>

  <li class="number">Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge:</li>
  <li>I would not for a million of gold</li>
  <li>The cause were known to them it most concerns;</li>

  <li>Away, I say!</li>
  <li>Now, by the gods that warlike Goths adore,</li>
  <li class="number">This petty brabble will undo us all.</li>
  <li>Why, lords, and think you not how dangerous</li>
  <li>It is to jet upon a prince’s right?</li>
  <li>What, is Lavinia then become so loose,</li>
  <li>Or Bassianus so degenerate,</li>
  <li class="number">That for her love such quarrels may be broach’d</li>
  <li>Without controlment, justice, or revenge?</li>
  <li>Young lords, beware! and should the empress know</li>

<ol data-speaker="AARON">
  <li>Why, are ye mad? or know ye not, in Rome</li>
  <li>How furious and impatient they be,</li>
  <li class="number">And cannot brook competitors in love?</li>
  <li>I tell you, lords, you do but plot your deaths</li>
  <li>By this device.</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DEMETRIUS">
  <li>Why makest thou it so strange?</li>
  <li>She is a woman, therefore may be woo’d;</li>
  <li>She is a woman, therefore may be won;</li>
  <li>She is Lavinia, therefore must be loved.</li>
  <li class="number">What, man! more water glideth by the mill</li>

  <li>Of a cut loaf to steal a shive, we know:</li>
  <li>Though Bassianus be the emperor’s brother.</li>
  <li>Better than he have worn Vulcan’s badge.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AARON">
  <li class="number"><span class="stage-direction">Aside</span>  Ay, and as good as Saturninus may.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DEMETRIUS">
  <li>Then why should he despair that knows to court it</li>

  <li>What, hast not thou full often struck a doe,</li>
  <li>And borne her cleanly by the keeper’s nose?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AARON">
  <li class="number">Why, then, it seems, some certain snatch or so</li>
  <li>Would serve your turns.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CHIRON">

<ol data-speaker="DEMETRIUS">
  <li>Aaron, thou hast hit it.</li>

  <li>Would you had hit it too!</li>
  <li class="number">Then should not we be tired with this ado.</li>
  <li>Why, hark ye, hark ye! and are you such fools</li>
  <li>To square for this? would it offend you, then</li>
  <li>That both should speed?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CHIRON">
  <li>Faith, not me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DEMETRIUS">
  <li class="number">Nor me, so I were one.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AARON">
  <li>For shame, be friends, and join for that you jar:</li>
  <li>’Tis policy and stratagem must do</li>
  <li>That you affect; and so must you resolve,</li>
  <li>That what you cannot as you would achieve,</li>
  <li class="number">You must perforce accomplish as you may.</li>
  <li>Take this of me: Lucrece was not more chaste</li>
  <li>Than this Lavinia, Bassianus’ love.</li>
  <li>A speedier course than lingering languishment</li>
  <li>Must we pursue, and I have found the path.</li>
  <li class="number">My lords, a solemn hunting is in hand;</li>
  <li>There will the lovely Roman ladies troop:</li>
  <li>The forest walks are wide and spacious;</li>
  <li>And many unfrequented plots there are</li>
  <li>Fitted by kind for rape and villany:</li>
  <li class="number">Single you thither then this dainty doe,</li>
  <li>And strike her home by force, if not by words:</li>
  <li>This way, or not at all, stand you in hope.</li>
  <li>Come, come, our empress, with her sacred wit</li>
  <li>To villany and vengeance consecrate,</li>
  <li class="number">Will we acquaint with all that we intend;</li>
  <li>And she shall file our engines with advice,</li>
  <li>That will not suffer you to square yourselves,</li>
  <li>But to your wishes’ height advance you both.</li>
  <li>The emperor’s court is like the house of Fame,</li>
  <li class="number">The palace full of tongues, of eyes, and ears:</li>
  <li>The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull;</li>
  <li>There speak, and strike, brave boys, and take</li>
  <li>your turns;</li>
  <li>There serve your lusts, shadow’d from heaven’s eye,</li>
  <li class="number">And revel in Lavinia’s treasury.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CHIRON">
  <li>Thy counsel, lad, smells of no cowardice,</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DEMETRIUS">
  <li>Sit fas aut nefas, till I find the stream</li>
  <li>To cool this heat, a charm to calm these fits.</li>

  <li>He that had wit would think that I had none,</li>

  <li>Let him that thinks of me so abjectly</li>
  <li class="number">Know that this gold must coin a stratagem,</li>

  <li class="number">My lovely Aaron, wherefore look’st thou sad,</li>
  <li>When every thing doth make a gleeful boast?</li>
  <li>The birds chant melody on every bush,</li>
  <li>The snake lies rolled in the cheerful sun,</li>
  <li>The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind</li>
  <li class="number">And make a chequer’d shadow on the ground:</li>
  <li>Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,</li>
  <li>And, whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds,</li>
  <li>Replying shrilly to the well-tuned horns,</li>
  <li>As if a double hunt were heard at once,</li>
  <li class="number">Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise;</li>
  <li>And, after conflict such as was supposed</li>
  <li>The wandering prince and Dido once enjoy’d,</li>
  <li>When with a happy storm they were surprised</li>
  <li>And curtain’d with a counsel-keeping cave,</li>

  <li>What signifies my deadly-standing eye,</li>
  <li>My silence and my cloudy melancholy,</li>
  <li>My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls</li>
  <li class="number">Even as an adder when she doth unroll</li>

  <li>No, madam, these are no venereal signs:</li>

  <li>Under your patience, gentle empress,</li>

  <li>Believe me, queen, your swarth Cimmerian</li>

  <li>The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,</li>
  <li class="number">O’ercome with moss and baleful mistletoe:</li>
  <li>Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,</li>
  <li>Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven:</li>
  <li>And when they show’d me this abhorred pit,</li>
  <li>They told me, here, at dead time of the night,</li>
  <li class="number">A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,</li>
  <li>Ten thousand swelling toads, as many urchins,</li>
  <li>Would make such fearful and confused cries</li>
  <li>As any mortal body hearing it</li>
  <li>Should straight fall mad, or else die suddenly.</li>
  <li class="number">No sooner had they told this hellish tale,</li>
  <li>But straight they told me they would bind me here</li>
  <li>Unto the body of a dismal yew,</li>
  <li>And leave me to this miserable death:</li>
  <li>And then they call’d me foul adulteress,</li>
  <li class="number">Lascivious Goth, and all the bitterest terms</li>
  <li>That ever ear did hear to such effect:</li>
  <li>And, had you not by wondrous fortune come,</li>
  <li>This vengeance on me had they executed.</li>
  <li>Revenge it, as you love your mother’s life,</li>
  <li class="number">Or be ye not henceforth call’d my children.</li>

  <li>Stay, madam; here is more belongs to her;</li>
  <li>First thrash the corn, then after burn the straw:</li>

  <li>Listen, fair madam: let it be your glory</li>

<ol data-speaker="LAVINIA">
  <li>When did the tiger’s young ones teach the dam?</li>
  <li>O, do not learn her wrath; she taught it thee;</li>

  <li class="number">Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny.</li>

<ol data-speaker="LAVINIA">
  <li>’Tis true; the raven doth not hatch a lark:</li>

  <li>Some say that ravens foster forlorn children,</li>

  <li>If I do wake, some planet strike me down,</li>
  <li class="number">That I may slumber in eternal sleep!</li>
  <li>Speak, gentle niece, what stern ungentle hands</li>
  <li>Have lopp’d and hew’d and made thy body bare</li>
  <li>Of her two branches, those sweet ornaments,</li>
  <li>Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in,</li>
  <li class="number">And might not gain so great a happiness</li>
  <li>As have thy love? Why dost not speak to me?</li>
  <li>Alas, a crimson river of warm blood,</li>
  <li>Like to a bubbling fountain stirr’d with wind,</li>
  <li>Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips,</li>
  <li class="number">Coming and going with thy honey breath.</li>
  <li>But, sure, some Tereus hath deflowered thee,</li>
  <li>And, lest thou shouldst detect him, cut thy tongue.</li>
  <li>Ah, now thou turn’st away thy face for shame!</li>
  <li>And, notwithstanding all this loss of blood,</li>
  <li class="number">As from a conduit with three issuing spouts,</li>
  <li>Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan’s face</li>
  <li>Blushing to be encountered with a cloud.</li>
  <li>Shall I speak for thee? shall I say ’tis so?</li>
  <li>O, that I knew thy heart; and knew the beast,</li>

  <li>Sorrow concealed, like an oven stopp’d,</li>

  <li>Fair Philomela, she but lost her tongue,</li>

  <li>A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,</li>

  <li>O, had the monster seen those lily hands</li>
  <li class="number">Tremble, like aspen-leaves, upon a lute,</li>
  <li>And make the silken strings delight to kiss them,</li>
  <li>He would not then have touch’d them for his life!</li>

<h3>SCENE I.  Rome. A street.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter Judges, Senators and Tribunes, with MARTIUS
and QUINTUS, bound, passing on to the place of
execution; TITUS going before, pleading</div>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>Hear me, grave fathers! noble tribunes, stay!</li>
  <li>For pity of mine age, whose youth was spent</li>
  <li>In dangerous wars, whilst you securely slept;</li>
  <li>For all my blood in Rome’s great quarrel shed;</li>
  <li class="number">For all the frosty nights that I have watch’d;</li>
  <li>And for these bitter tears, which now you see</li>
  <li>Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks;</li>
  <li>Be pitiful to my condemned sons,</li>
  <li>Whose souls are not corrupted as ’tis thought.</li>
  <li class="number">For two and twenty sons I never wept,</li>
  <li>Because they died in honour’s lofty bed.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Lieth down; the Judges, &c., pass by him, and Exeunt</li>
  <li>For these, these, tribunes, in the dust I write</li>
  <li>My heart’s deep languor and my soul’s sad tears:</li>
  <li>Let my tears stanch the earth’s dry appetite;</li>
  <li class="number">My sons’ sweet blood will make it shame and blush.</li>
  <li>O earth, I will befriend thee more with rain,</li>
  <li>That shall distil from these two ancient urns,</li>
  <li>Than youthful April shall with all his showers:</li>
  <li>In summer’s drought I’ll drop upon thee still;</li>
  <li class="number">In winter with warm tears I’ll melt the snow</li>
  <li>And keep eternal spring-time on thy face,</li>
  <li>So thou refuse to drink my dear sons’ blood.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter LUCIUS, with his sword drawn</li>
  <li>O reverend tribunes! O gentle, aged men!</li>
  <li>Unbind my sons, reverse the doom of death;</li>
  <li class="number">And let me say, that never wept before,</li>
  <li>My tears are now prevailing orators.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIUS">
  <li>O noble father, you lament in vain:</li>
  <li>The tribunes hear you not; no man is by;</li>
  <li>And you recount your sorrows to a stone.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li class="number">Ah, Lucius, for thy brothers let me plead.</li>
  <li>Grave tribunes, once more I entreat of you — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIUS">
  <li>My gracious lord, no tribune hears you speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>Why, tis no matter, man; if they did hear,</li>
  <li>They would not mark me, or if they did mark,</li>
  <li class="number">They would not pity me, yet plead I must;</li>
  <li>And bootless unto them.</li>
  <li>Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones;</li>
  <li>Who, though they cannot answer my distress,</li>
  <li>Yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes,</li>
  <li class="number">For that they will not intercept my tale:</li>
  <li>When I do weep, they humbly at my feet</li>
  <li>Receive my tears and seem to weep with me;</li>
  <li>And, were they but attired in grave weeds,</li>
  <li>Rome could afford no tribune like to these.</li>
  <li class="number">A stone is soft as wax — tribunes more hard than stones;</li>
  <li>A stone is silent, and offendeth not,</li>
  <li>And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Rises</li>
  <li>But wherefore stand’st thou with thy weapon drawn?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIUS">
  <li>To rescue my two brothers from their death:</li>
  <li class="number">For which attempt the judges have pronounced</li>
  <li>My everlasting doom of banishment.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>O happy man! they have befriended thee.</li>
  <li>Why, foolish Lucius, dost thou not perceive</li>
  <li>That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers?</li>
  <li class="number">Tigers must prey, and Rome affords no prey</li>
  <li>But me and mine: how happy art thou, then,</li>
  <li>From these devourers to be banished!</li>
  <li>But who comes with our brother Marcus here?</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter MARCUS and LAVINIA</div>

<ol data-speaker="MARCUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>Titus, prepare thy aged eyes to weep;</li>
  <li class="number">Or, if not so, thy noble heart to break:</li>
  <li>I bring consuming sorrow to thine age.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>Will it consume me? let me see it, then.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>This was thy daughter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>Why, Marcus, so she is.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIUS">
  <li class="number">Ay me, this object kills me!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>Faint-hearted boy, arise, and look upon her.</li>
  <li>Speak, Lavinia, what accursed hand</li>
  <li>Hath made thee handless in thy father’s sight?</li>
  <li>What fool hath added water to the sea,</li>
  <li class="number">Or brought a faggot to bright-burning Troy?</li>
  <li>My grief was at the height before thou camest,</li>
  <li>And now like Nilus, it disdaineth bounds.</li>
  <li>Give me a sword, I’ll chop off my hands too;</li>
  <li>For they have fought for Rome, and all in vain;</li>
  <li class="number">And they have nursed this woe, in feeding life;</li>
  <li>In bootless prayer have they been held up,</li>
  <li>And they have served me to effectless use:</li>
  <li>Now all the service I require of them</li>
  <li>Is that the one will help to cut the other.</li>
  <li class="number">’Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands;</li>
  <li>For hands, to do Rome service, are but vain.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIUS">
  <li>Speak, gentle sister, who hath martyr’d thee?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>O, that delightful engine of her thoughts</li>
  <li>That blabb’d them with such pleasing eloquence,</li>
  <li class="number">Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage,</li>
  <li>Where, like a sweet melodious bird, it sung</li>
  <li>Sweet varied notes, enchanting every ear!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIUS">
  <li>O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>O, thus I found her, straying in the park,</li>
  <li class="number">Seeking to hide herself, as doth the deer</li>
  <li>That hath received some unrecuring wound.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>It was my deer; and he that wounded her</li>
  <li>Hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead:</li>
  <li>For now I stand as one upon a rock</li>
  <li class="number">Environed with a wilderness of sea,</li>
  <li>Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave,</li>
  <li>Expecting ever when some envious surge</li>
  <li>Will in his brinish bowels swallow him.</li>
  <li>This way to death my wretched sons are gone;</li>
  <li class="number">Here stands my other son, a banished man,</li>
  <li>And here my brother, weeping at my woes.</li>
  <li>But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn,</li>
  <li>Is dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul.</li>
  <li>Had I but seen thy picture in this plight,</li>
  <li class="number">It would have madded me: what shall I do</li>
  <li>Now I behold thy lively body so?</li>
  <li>Thou hast no hands, to wipe away thy tears:</li>
  <li>Nor tongue, to tell me who hath martyr’d thee:</li>
  <li>Thy husband he is dead: and for his death</li>
  <li class="number">Thy brothers are condemn’d, and dead by this.</li>
  <li>Look, Marcus! ah, son Lucius, look on her!</li>
  <li>When I did name her brothers, then fresh tears</li>
  <li>Stood on her cheeks, as doth the honey-dew</li>
  <li>Upon a gather’d lily almost wither’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li class="number">Perchance she weeps because they kill’d her husband;</li>
  <li>Perchance because she knows them innocent.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful</li>
  <li>Because the law hath ta’en revenge on them.</li>
  <li>No, no, they would not do so foul a deed;</li>
  <li class="number">Witness the sorrow that their sister makes.</li>
  <li>Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips.</li>
  <li>Or make some sign how I may do thee ease:</li>
  <li>Shall thy good uncle, and thy brother Lucius,</li>
  <li>And thou, and I, sit round about some fountain,</li>
  <li class="number">Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks</li>
  <li>How they are stain’d, as meadows, yet not dry,</li>
  <li>With miry slime left on them by a flood?</li>
  <li>And in the fountain shall we gaze so long</li>
  <li>Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness,</li>
  <li class="number">And made a brine-pit with our bitter tears?</li>
  <li>Or shall we cut away our hands, like thine?</li>
  <li>Or shall we bite our tongues, and in dumb shows</li>
  <li>Pass the remainder of our hateful days?</li>
  <li>What shall we do? let us, that have our tongues,</li>
  <li class="number">Plot some deuce of further misery,</li>
  <li>To make us wonder’d at in time to come.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIUS">
  <li>Sweet father, cease your tears; for, at your grief,</li>
  <li>See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>Patience, dear niece. Good Titus, dry thine eyes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li class="number">Ah, Marcus, Marcus! brother, well I wot</li>
  <li>Thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine,</li>
  <li>For thou, poor man, hast drown’d it with thine own.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIUS">
  <li>Ah, my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>Mark, Marcus, mark! I understand her signs:</li>
  <li class="number">Had she a tongue to speak, now would she say</li>
  <li>That to her brother which I said to thee:</li>
  <li>His napkin, with his true tears all bewet,</li>
  <li>Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks.</li>
  <li>O, what a sympathy of woe is this,</li>
  <li class="number">As far from help as Limbo is from bliss!</li>

  <li>Farewell, proud Rome; till Lucius come again,</li>
  <li>He leaves his pledges dearer than his life:</li>
  <li class="number">Farewell, Lavinia, my noble sister;</li>
  <li>O, would thou wert as thou tofore hast been!</li>
  <li>But now nor Lucius nor Lavinia lives</li>
  <li>But in oblivion and hateful griefs.</li>
  <li>If Lucius live, he will requite your wrongs;</li>
  <li class="number">And make proud Saturnine and his empress</li>
  <li>Beg at the gates, like Tarquin and his queen.</li>
  <li>Now will I to the Goths, and raise a power,</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  A room in Titus’s house. A banquet set out.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter TITUS, MARCUS, LAVINIA and Young LUCIUS, a boy</div>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>So, so; now sit: and look you eat no more</li>
  <li>Than will preserve just so much strength in us</li>
  <li>As will revenge these bitter woes of ours.</li>
  <li>Marcus, unknit that sorrow-wreathen knot:</li>
  <li class="number">Thy niece and I, poor creatures, want our hands,</li>
  <li>And cannot passionate our tenfold grief</li>
  <li>With folded arms. This poor right hand of mine</li>
  <li>Is left to tyrannize upon my breast;</li>
  <li>Who, when my heart, all mad with misery,</li>
  <li class="number">Beats in this hollow prison of my flesh,</li>
  <li>Then thus I thump it down.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">To LAVINIA</li>
  <li>Thou map of woe, that thus dost talk in signs!</li>
  <li>When thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating,</li>
  <li>Thou canst not strike it thus to make it still.</li>
  <li class="number">Wound it with sighing, girl, kill it with groans;</li>
  <li>Or get some little knife between thy teeth,</li>
  <li>And just against thy heart make thou a hole;</li>
  <li>That all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall</li>
  <li>May run into that sink, and soaking in</li>
  <li class="number">Drown the lamenting fool in sea-salt tears.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>Fie, brother, fie! teach her not thus to lay</li>
  <li>Such violent hands upon her tender life.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>How now! has sorrow made thee dote already?</li>
  <li>Why, Marcus, no man should be mad but I.</li>
  <li class="number">What violent hands can she lay on her life?</li>
  <li>Ah, wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands;</li>
  <li>To bid AEneas tell the tale twice o’er,</li>
  <li>How Troy was burnt and he made miserable?</li>
  <li>O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,</li>
  <li class="number">Lest we remember still that we have none.</li>
  <li>Fie, fie, how franticly I square my talk,</li>
  <li>As if we should forget we had no hands,</li>
  <li>If Marcus did not name the word of hands!</li>
  <li>Come, let’s fall to; and, gentle girl, eat this:</li>
  <li class="number">Here is no drink! Hark, Marcus, what she says;</li>
  <li>I can interpret all her martyr’d signs;</li>
  <li>She says she drinks no other drink but tears,</li>
  <li>Brew’d with her sorrow, mesh’d upon her cheeks:</li>
  <li>Speechless complainer, I will learn thy thought;</li>
  <li class="number">In thy dumb action will I be as perfect</li>
  <li>As begging hermits in their holy prayers:</li>
  <li>Thou shalt not sigh, nor hold thy stumps to heaven,</li>
  <li>Nor wink, nor nod, nor kneel, nor make a sign,</li>
  <li>But I of these will wrest an alphabet</li>
  <li class="number">And by still practise learn to know thy meaning.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Young LUCIUS">
  <li>Good grandsire, leave these bitter deep laments:</li>
  <li>Make my aunt merry with some pleasing tale.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>Alas, the tender boy, in passion moved,</li>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li class="number">Peace, tender sapling; thou art made of tears,</li>
  <li>And tears will quickly melt thy life away.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">MARCUS strikes the dish with a knife</li>
  <li>What dost thou strike at, Marcus, with thy knife?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>At that that I have kill’d, my lord; a fly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>Out on thee, murderer! thou kill’st my heart;</li>
  <li class="number">Mine eyes are cloy’d with view of tyranny:</li>
  <li>A deed of death done on the innocent</li>
  <li>Becomes not Titus’ brother: get thee gone:</li>
  <li>I see thou art not for my company.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>Alas, my lord, I have but kill’d a fly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li class="number">But how, if that fly had a father and mother?</li>
  <li>How would he hang his slender gilded wings,</li>
  <li>And buzz lamenting doings in the air!</li>
  <li>Poor harmless fly,</li>
  <li>That, with his pretty buzzing melody,</li>
  <li class="number">Came here to make us merry! and thou hast</li>
  <li>kill’d him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>Pardon me, sir; it was a black ill-favor’d fly,</li>
  <li>Like to the empress’ Moor; therefore I kill’d him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>O, O, O,</li>
  <li class="number">Then pardon me for reprehending thee,</li>
  <li>For thou hast done a charitable deed.</li>
  <li>Give me thy knife, I will insult on him;</li>
  <li>Flattering myself, as if it were the Moor</li>
  <li>Come hither purposely to poison me. — </li>
  <li class="number">There’s for thyself, and that’s for Tamora.</li>
  <li>Ah, sirrah!</li>
  <li>Yet, I think, we are not brought so low,</li>
  <li>But that between us we can kill a fly</li>
  <li>That comes in likeness of a coal-black Moor.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li class="number">Alas, poor man! grief has so wrought on him,</li>
  <li>He takes false shadows for true substances.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>Come, take away. Lavinia, go with me:</li>
  <li>I’ll to thy closet; and go read with thee</li>
  <li>Sad stories chanced in the times of old.</li>
  <li class="number">Come, boy, and go with me: thy sight is young,</li>

<h3>SCENE I.  Rome. Titus’s garden.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter young LUCIUS, and LAVINIA running after him,

arm. Then enter TITUS and MARCUS</div>

<ol data-speaker="Young LUCIUS">
  <li>Help, grandsire, help! my aunt Lavinia</li>
  <li>Follows me every where, I know not why:</li>
  <li>Good uncle Marcus, see how swift she comes.</li>
  <li>Alas, sweet aunt, I know not what you mean.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li class="number">Stand by me, Lucius; do not fear thine aunt.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Young LUCIUS">
  <li>Ay, when my father was in Rome she did.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>What means my niece Lavinia by these signs?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>Fear her not, Lucius: somewhat doth she mean:</li>
  <li class="number">See, Lucius, see how much she makes of thee:</li>
  <li>Somewhither would she have thee go with her.</li>
  <li>Ah, boy, Cornelia never with more care</li>
  <li>Read to her sons than she hath read to thee</li>
  <li>Sweet poetry and Tully’s Orator.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li class="number">Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Young LUCIUS">
  <li>My lord, I know not, I, nor can I guess,</li>
  <li>Unless some fit or frenzy do possess her:</li>
  <li>For I have heard my grandsire say full oft,</li>
  <li>Extremity of griefs would make men mad;</li>
  <li class="number">And I have read that Hecuba of Troy</li>
  <li>Ran mad through sorrow: that made me to fear;</li>
  <li>Although, my lord, I know my noble aunt</li>
  <li>Loves me as dear as e’er my mother did,</li>
  <li>And would not, but in fury, fright my youth:</li>
  <li class="number">Which made me down to throw my books, and fly — </li>
  <li>Causeless, perhaps. But pardon me, sweet aunt:</li>
  <li>And, madam, if my uncle Marcus go,</li>
  <li>I will most willingly attend your ladyship.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>Lucius, I will.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">LAVINIA turns over with her stumps the books which
LUCIUS has let fall</div>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li class="number">How now, Lavinia! Marcus, what means this?</li>
  <li>Some book there is that she desires to see.</li>
  <li>Which is it, girl, of these? Open them, boy.</li>
  <li>But thou art deeper read, and better skill’d</li>
  <li>Come, and take choice of all my library,</li>
  <li class="number">And so beguile thy sorrow, till the heavens</li>
  <li>Reveal the damn’d contriver of this deed.</li>
  <li>Why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>I think she means that there was more than one</li>
  <li>Confederate in the fact: ay, more there was;</li>
  <li class="number">Or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>Lucius, what book is that she tosseth so?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Young LUCIUS">
  <li>Grandsire, ’tis Ovid’s Metamorphoses;</li>
  <li>My mother gave it me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>For love of her that’s gone,</li>
  <li class="number">Perhaps she cull’d it from among the rest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>Soft! see how busily she turns the leaves!</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Helping her</li>
  <li>What would she find? Lavinia, shall I read?</li>
  <li>This is the tragic tale of Philomel,</li>
  <li>And treats of Tereus’ treason and his rape:</li>
  <li class="number">And rape, I fear, was root of thine annoy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>See, brother, see; note how she quotes the leaves.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>Lavinia, wert thou thus surprised, sweet girl,</li>
  <li>Ravish’d and wrong’d, as Philomela was,</li>
  <li>Forced in the ruthless, vast, and gloomy woods? See, see!</li>
  <li class="number">Ay, such a place there is, where we did hunt — </li>
  <li>O, had we never, never hunted there! — </li>
  <li>Pattern’d by that the poet here describes,</li>
  <li>By nature made for murders and for rapes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>O, why should nature build so foul a den,</li>
  <li class="number">Unless the gods delight in tragedies?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>Give signs, sweet girl, for here are none</li>
  <li>but friends,</li>
  <li>What Roman lord it was durst do the deed:</li>
  <li>Or slunk not Saturnine, as Tarquin erst,</li>
  <li class="number">That left the camp to sin in Lucrece’ bed?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>Sit down, sweet niece: brother, sit down by me.</li>
  <li>Apollo, Pallas, Jove, or Mercury,</li>
  <li>Inspire me, that I may this treason find!</li>
  <li>My lord, look here: look here, Lavinia:</li>
  <li class="number">This sandy plot is plain; guide, if thou canst</li>
  <li>This after me, when I have writ my name</li>
  <li>Without the help of any hand at all.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">He writes his name with his staff, and guides it
with feet and mouth</li>
  <li>Cursed be that heart that forced us to this shift!</li>
  <li>Write thou good niece; and here display, at last,</li>

  <li>Heaven guide thy pen to print thy sorrows plain,</li>
  <li>That we may know the traitors and the truth!</li>

</ol>

  <li>Performers of this heinous, bloody deed?</li>

  <li>Tam lentus audis scelera? tam lentus vides?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>O, calm thee, gentle lord; although I know</li>
  <li class="number">There is enough written upon this earth</li>
  <li>To stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts</li>
  <li>And arm the minds of infants to exclaims.</li>
  <li>My lord, kneel down with me; Lavinia, kneel;</li>
  <li>And kneel, sweet boy, the Roman Hector’s hope;</li>
  <li class="number">And swear with me, as, with the woful fere</li>
  <li>And father of that chaste dishonour’d dame,</li>
  <li>Lord Junius Brutus sware for Lucrece’ rape,</li>
  <li>That we will prosecute by good advice</li>
  <li>Mortal revenge upon these traitorous Goths,</li>
  <li class="number">And see their blood, or die with this reproach.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>’Tis sure enough, an you knew how.</li>
  <li>But if you hunt these bear-whelps, then beware:</li>
  <li>The dam will wake; and, if she wind you once,</li>
  <li>She’s with the lion deeply still in league,</li>
  <li class="number">And lulls him whilst she playeth on her back,</li>
  <li>And when he sleeps will she do what she list.</li>
  <li>You are a young huntsman, Marcus; let it alone;</li>
  <li>And, come, I will go get a leaf of brass,</li>
  <li>And with a gad of steel will write these words,</li>
  <li class="number">And lay it by: the angry northern wind</li>

  <li>See, here’s to Jove, and this to Mercury;</li>
  <li class="number">This to Apollo; this to the god of war;</li>
  <li>Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome!</li>

<h3>SCENE I.  Plains near Rome.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter LUCIUS with an army of Goths, with drum and colours</div>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIUS">
  <li>Approved warriors, and my faithful friends,</li>
  <li>I have received letters from great Rome,</li>
  <li>Which signify what hate they bear their emperor</li>
  <li>And how desirous of our sight they are.</li>
  <li class="number">Therefore, great lords, be, as your titles witness,</li>
  <li>Imperious and impatient of your wrongs,</li>
  <li>And wherein Rome hath done you any scath,</li>
  <li>Let him make treble satisfaction.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Goth">
  <li>Brave slip, sprung from the great Andronicus,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose name was once our terror, now our comfort;</li>
  <li>Whose high exploits and honourable deeds</li>
  <li>Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt,</li>
  <li>Be bold in us: we’ll follow where thou lead’st,</li>
  <li>Like stinging bees in hottest summer’s day</li>
  <li class="number">Led by their master to the flowered fields,</li>
  <li>And be avenged on cursed Tamora.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="All the Goths">
  <li>And as he saith, so say we all with him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIUS">
  <li>I humbly thank him, and I thank you all.</li>
  <li>But who comes here, led by a lusty Goth?</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter a Goth, leading AARON with his Child in his arms</div>

<ol data-speaker="Second Goth">
  <li class="number">Renowned Lucius, from our troops I stray’d</li>
  <li>To gaze upon a ruinous monastery;</li>
  <li>And, as I earnestly did fix mine eye</li>
  <li>Upon the wasted building, suddenly</li>
  <li>I heard a child cry underneath a wall.</li>
  <li class="number">I made unto the noise; when soon I heard</li>
  <li>The crying babe controll’d with this discourse:</li>
  <li>’Peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dam!</li>
  <li>Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art,</li>
  <li>Had nature lent thee but thy mother’s look,</li>
  <li class="number">Villain, thou mightst have been an emperor:</li>
  <li>But where the bull and cow are both milk-white,</li>
  <li>They never do beget a coal-black calf.</li>
  <li>Peace, villain, peace!’ — even thus he rates</li>
  <li>the babe — </li>
  <li class="number">’For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth;</li>
  <li>Who, when he knows thou art the empress’ babe,</li>
  <li>Will hold thee dearly for thy mother’s sake.’</li>
  <li>With this, my weapon drawn, I rush’d upon him,</li>
  <li>Surprised him suddenly, and brought him hither,</li>
  <li class="number">To use as you think needful of the man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIUS">
  <li>O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil</li>
  <li>That robb’d Andronicus of his good hand;</li>
  <li>This is the pearl that pleased your empress’ eye,</li>
  <li>And here’s the base fruit of his burning lust.</li>
  <li class="number">Say, wall-eyed slave, whither wouldst thou convey</li>
  <li>This growing image of thy fiend-like face?</li>
  <li>Why dost not speak? what, deaf? not a word?</li>
  <li>A halter, soldiers! hang him on this tree.</li>
  <li>And by his side his fruit of bastardy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AARON">
  <li class="number">Touch not the boy; he is of royal blood.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIUS">
  <li>Too like the sire for ever being good.</li>
  <li>First hang the child, that he may see it sprawl;</li>
  <li>A sight to vex the father’s soul withal.</li>
  <li>Get me a ladder.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">A ladder brought, which AARON is made to ascend</div>

<ol data-speaker="AARON">
  <li class="number">Lucius, save the child,</li>
  <li>And bear it from me to the empress.</li>
  <li>If thou do this, I’ll show thee wondrous things,</li>
  <li>That highly may advantage thee to hear:</li>
  <li>If thou wilt not, befall what may befall,</li>
  <li class="number">I’ll speak no more but ’Vengeance rot you all!’</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIUS">
  <li>Say on: an if it please me which thou speak’st</li>
  <li>Thy child shall live, and I will see it nourish’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AARON">
  <li>An if it please thee! why, assure thee, Lucius,</li>
  <li>’Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak;</li>
  <li class="number">For I must talk of murders, rapes and massacres,</li>
  <li>Acts of black night, abominable deeds,</li>
  <li>Complots of mischief, treason, villanies</li>
  <li>Ruthful to hear, yet piteously perform’d:</li>
  <li>And this shall all be buried by my death,</li>
  <li class="number">Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIUS">
  <li>Tell on thy mind; I say thy child shall live.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AARON">
  <li>Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIUS">
  <li>Who should I swear by? thou believest no god:</li>
  <li>That granted, how canst thou believe an oath?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AARON">
  <li class="number">What if I do not? as, indeed, I do not;</li>
  <li>Yet, for I know thou art religious</li>
  <li>And hast a thing within thee called conscience,</li>
  <li>With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies,</li>
  <li>Which I have seen thee careful to observe,</li>
  <li class="number">Therefore I urge thy oath; for that I know</li>
  <li>An idiot holds his bauble for a god</li>
  <li>And keeps the oath which by that god he swears,</li>
  <li>To that I’ll urge him: therefore thou shalt vow</li>
  <li>By that same god, what god soe’er it be,</li>
  <li class="number">That thou adorest and hast in reverence,</li>
  <li>To save my boy, to nourish and bring him up;</li>
  <li>Or else I will discover nought to thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIUS">
  <li>Even by my god I swear to thee I will.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AARON">
  <li>First know thou, I begot him on the empress.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIUS">
  <li class="number">O most insatiate and luxurious woman!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AARON">
  <li>Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity</li>
  <li>To that which thou shalt hear of me anon.</li>
  <li>’Twas her two sons that murder’d Bassianus;</li>
  <li>They cut thy sister’s tongue and ravish’d her</li>
  <li class="number">And cut her hands and trimm’d her as thou saw’st.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIUS">
  <li>O detestable villain! call’st thou that trimming?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AARON">
  <li>Why, she was wash’d and cut and trimm’d, and ’twas</li>
  <li>Trim sport for them that had the doing of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIUS">
  <li>O barbarous, beastly villains, like thyself!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AARON">
  <li class="number">Indeed, I was their tutor to instruct them:</li>
  <li>That codding spirit had they from their mother,</li>
  <li>As sure a card as ever won the set;</li>
  <li>That bloody mind, I think, they learn’d of me,</li>
  <li>As true a dog as ever fought at head.</li>
  <li class="number">Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth.</li>
  <li>I train’d thy brethren to that guileful hole</li>
  <li>Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay:</li>
  <li>I wrote the letter that thy father found</li>
  <li>And hid the gold within the letter mention’d,</li>
  <li class="number">Confederate with the queen and her two sons:</li>
  <li>And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue,</li>
  <li>Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?</li>
  <li>I play’d the cheater for thy father’s hand,</li>
  <li>And, when I had it, drew myself apart</li>
  <li class="number">And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter:</li>
  <li>I pry’d me through the crevice of a wall</li>
  <li>When, for his hand, he had his two sons’ heads;</li>
  <li>Beheld his tears, and laugh’d so heartily,</li>
  <li>That both mine eyes were rainy like to his :</li>
  <li class="number">And when I told the empress of this sport,</li>
  <li>She swooned almost at my pleasing tale,</li>
  <li>And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Goth">
  <li>What, canst thou say all this, and never blush?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AARON">
  <li>Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIUS">
  <li class="number">Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AARON">
  <li>Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.</li>
  <li>Even now I curse the day — and yet, I think,</li>
  <li>Few come within the compass of my curse — </li>
  <li>Wherein I did not some notorious ill,</li>
  <li class="number">As kill a man, or else devise his death,</li>
  <li>Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it,</li>
  <li>Accuse some innocent and forswear myself,</li>
  <li>Set deadly enmity between two friends,</li>
  <li>Make poor men’s cattle break their necks;</li>
  <li class="number">Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night,</li>
  <li>And bid the owners quench them with their tears.</li>
  <li>Oft have I digg’d up dead men from their graves,</li>
  <li>And set them upright at their dear friends’ doors,</li>
  <li>Even when their sorrows almost were forgot;</li>
  <li class="number">And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,</li>
  <li>Have with my knife carved in Roman letters,</li>
  <li>’Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.’</li>
  <li>Tut, I have done a thousand dreadful things</li>
  <li>As willingly as one would kill a fly,</li>
  <li class="number">And nothing grieves me heartily indeed</li>
  <li>But that I cannot do ten thousand more.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIUS">
  <li>Bring down the devil; for he must not die</li>
  <li>So sweet a death as hanging presently.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AARON">
  <li>If there be devils, would I were a devil,</li>
  <li class="number">To live and burn in everlasting fire,</li>
  <li>So I might have your company in hell,</li>
  <li>But to torment you with my bitter tongue!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIUS">
  <li>Sirs, stop his mouth, and let him speak no more.</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter a Goth</div>

<ol data-speaker="Third Goth">
  <li>My lord, there is a messenger from Rome</li>
  <li class="number">Desires to be admitted to your presence.</li>

  <li class="stage-direction">Enter AEMILIUS</li>

<ol data-speaker="AEMILIUS">
  <li>Lord Lucius, and you princes of the Goths,</li>
  <li>The Roman emperor greets you all by me;</li>

  <li>Come, come, Lavinia; look, thy foes are bound.</li>
  <li>Sirs, stop their mouths, let them not speak to me;</li>
  <li>But let them hear what fearful words I utter.</li>
  <li class="number">O villains, Chiron and Demetrius!</li>
  <li>Here stands the spring whom you have stain’d with mud,</li>
  <li>This goodly summer with your winter mix’d.</li>
  <li>You kill’d her husband, and for that vile fault</li>
  <li>Two of her brothers were condemn’d to death,</li>
  <li class="number">My hand cut off and made a merry jest;</li>
  <li>Both her sweet hands, her tongue, and that more dear</li>
  <li>Than hands or tongue, her spotless chastity,</li>
  <li>Inhuman traitors, you constrain’d and forced.</li>
  <li>What would you say, if I should let you speak?</li>
  <li class="number">Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.</li>
  <li>Hark, wretches! how I mean to martyr you.</li>
  <li>This one hand yet is left to cut your throats,</li>
  <li>Whilst that Lavinia ’tween her stumps doth hold</li>
  <li>The basin that receives your guilty blood.</li>
  <li class="number">You know your mother means to feast with me,</li>
  <li>And calls herself Revenge, and thinks me mad:</li>
  <li>Hark, villains! I will grind your bones to dust</li>
  <li>And with your blood and it I’ll make a paste,</li>
  <li>And of the paste a coffin I will rear</li>
  <li class="number">And make two pasties of your shameful heads,</li>
  <li>And bid that strumpet, your unhallow’d dam,</li>
  <li>Like to the earth swallow her own increase.</li>
  <li>This is the feast that I have bid her to,</li>
  <li>And this the banquet she shall surfeit on;</li>
  <li class="number">For worse than Philomel you used my daughter,</li>
  <li>And worse than Progne I will be revenged:</li>
  <li>And now prepare your throats. Lavinia, come,</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">He cuts their throats</li>
  <li>Receive the blood: and when that they are dead,</li>
  <li>Let me go grind their bones to powder small</li>
  <li class="number">And with this hateful liquor temper it;</li>
  <li>And in that paste let their vile heads be baked.</li>
  <li>Come, come, be every one officious</li>
  <li>To make this banquet; which I wish may prove</li>
  <li>More stern and bloody than the Centaurs’ feast.</li>
  <li class="number">So, now bring them in, for I’ll play the cook,</li>
  <li>And see them ready ’gainst their mother comes.</li>

<h3>SCENE III.  Court of TITUS’s house. A banquet set out.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter LUCIUS, MARCUS, and Goths, with AARON prisoner</div>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIUS">
  <li>Uncle Marcus, since it is my father’s mind</li>
  <li>That I repair to Rome, I am content.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Goth">
  <li>And ours with thine, befall what fortune will.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIUS">
  <li>Good uncle, take you in this barbarous Moor,</li>
  <li class="number">This ravenous tiger, this accursed devil;</li>
  <li>Let him receive no sustenance, fetter him</li>
  <li>Till he be brought unto the empress’ face,</li>
  <li>For testimony of her foul proceedings:</li>
  <li>And see the ambush of our friends be strong;</li>
  <li class="number">I fear the emperor means no good to us.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AARON">
  <li>Some devil whisper curses in mine ear,</li>
  <li>And prompt me, that my tongue may utter forth</li>
  <li>The venomous malice of my swelling heart!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIUS">
  <li>Away, inhuman dog! unhallow’d slave!</li>
  <li class="number">Sirs, help our uncle to convey him in.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exeunt Goths, with AARON. Flourish within</li>
  <li>The trumpets show the emperor is at hand.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter SATURNINUS and TAMORA, with AEMILIUS,
Tribunes, Senators, and others</div>

<ol data-speaker="SATURNINUS">
  <li>What, hath the firmament more suns than one?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIUS">
  <li>What boots it thee to call thyself a sun?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>Rome’s emperor, and nephew, break the parle;</li>
  <li class="number">These quarrels must be quietly debated.</li>
  <li>The feast is ready, which the careful Titus</li>
  <li>Hath ordain’d to an honourable end,</li>
  <li>For peace, for love, for league, and good to Rome:</li>
  <li>Please you, therefore, draw nigh, and take your places.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SATURNINUS">
  <li class="number">Marcus, we will.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Hautboys sound. The Company sit down at table</div>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter TITUS dressed like a Cook, LAVINIA veiled,
Young LUCIUS, and others. TITUS places the dishes
on the table</div>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>Welcome, my gracious lord; welcome, dread queen;</li>
  <li>Welcome, ye warlike Goths; welcome, Lucius;</li>
  <li>And welcome, all: although the cheer be poor,</li>
  <li>’Twill fill your stomachs; please you eat of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SATURNINUS">
  <li class="number">Why art thou thus attired, Andronicus?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>Because I would be sure to have all well,</li>
  <li>To entertain your highness and your empress.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TAMORA">
  <li>We are beholding to you, good Andronicus.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>An if your highness knew my heart, you were.</li>
  <li class="number">My lord the emperor, resolve me this:</li>
  <li>Was it well done of rash Virginius</li>
  <li>To slay his daughter with his own right hand,</li>
  <li>Because she was enforced, stain’d, and deflower’d?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SATURNINUS">
  <li>It was, Andronicus.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li class="number">Your reason, mighty lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SATURNINUS">
  <li>Because the girl should not survive her shame,</li>
  <li>And by her presence still renew his sorrows.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>A reason mighty, strong, and effectual;</li>
  <li>A pattern, precedent, and lively warrant,</li>
  <li class="number">For me, most wretched, to perform the like.</li>
  <li>Die, die, Lavinia, and thy shame with thee;</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Kills LAVINIA</li>
  <li>And, with thy shame, thy father’s sorrow die!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SATURNINUS">
  <li>What hast thou done, unnatural and unkind?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>Kill’d her, for whom my tears have made me blind.</li>
  <li class="number">I am as woful as Virginius was,</li>
  <li>And have a thousand times more cause than he</li>
  <li>To do this outrage: and it now is done.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SATURNINUS">
  <li>What, was she ravish’d? tell who did the deed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>Will’t please you eat? will’t please your</li>
  <li class="number">highness feed?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TAMORA">
  <li>Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>Not I; ’twas Chiron and Demetrius:</li>
  <li>They ravish’d her, and cut away her tongue;</li>
  <li>And they, ’twas they, that did her all this wrong.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SATURNINUS">
  <li class="number">Go fetch them hither to us presently.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TITUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>Why, there they are both, baked in that pie;</li>
  <li>Whereof their mother daintily hath fed,</li>
  <li>Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.</li>
  <li>’Tis true, ’tis true; witness my knife’s sharp point.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Kills TAMORA</div>

<ol data-speaker="SATURNINUS">
  <li class="number">Die, frantic wretch, for this accursed deed!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Kills TITUS</div>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIUS">
  <li>Can the son’s eye behold his father bleed?</li>
  <li>There’s meed for meed, death for a deadly deed!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Kills SATURNINUS. A great tumult. LUCIUS, MARCUS,
and others go up into the balcony</div>

<ol data-speaker="MARCUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>You sad-faced men, people and sons of Rome,</li>
  <li>By uproar sever’d, like a flight of fowl</li>
  <li class="number">Scatter’d by winds and high tempestuous gusts,</li>
  <li>O, let me teach you how to knit again</li>
  <li>This scatter’d corn into one mutual sheaf,</li>
  <li>These broken limbs again into one body;</li>
  <li>Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself,</li>
  <li class="number">And she whom mighty kingdoms court’sy to,</li>
  <li>Like a forlorn and desperate castaway,</li>
  <li>Do shameful execution on herself.</li>
  <li>But if my frosty signs and chaps of age,</li>
  <li>Grave witnesses of true experience,</li>
  <li class="number">Cannot induce you to attend my words,</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">To LUCIUS</li>
  <li>Speak, Rome’s dear friend, as erst our ancestor,</li>
  <li>When with his solemn tongue he did discourse</li>
  <li>To love-sick Dido’s sad attending ear</li>
  <li>The story of that baleful burning night</li>
  <li class="number">When subtle Greeks surprised King Priam’s Troy,</li>
  <li>Tell us what Sinon hath bewitch’d our ears,</li>
  <li>Or who hath brought the fatal engine in</li>
  <li>That gives our Troy, our Rome, the civil wound.</li>
  <li>My heart is not compact of flint nor steel;</li>
  <li class="number">Nor can I utter all our bitter grief,</li>
  <li>But floods of tears will drown my oratory,</li>
  <li>And break my utterance, even in the time</li>
  <li>When it should move you to attend me most,</li>
  <li>Lending your kind commiseration.</li>
  <li class="number">Here is a captain, let him tell the tale;</li>
  <li>Your hearts will throb and weep to hear him speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIUS">
  <li>Then, noble auditory, be it known to you,</li>
  <li>That cursed Chiron and Demetrius</li>
  <li>Were they that murdered our emperor’s brother;</li>
  <li class="number">And they it were that ravished our sister:</li>
  <li>For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded;</li>
  <li>Our father’s tears despised, and basely cozen’d</li>
  <li>Of that true hand that fought Rome’s quarrel out,</li>
  <li>And sent her enemies unto the grave.</li>
  <li class="number">Lastly, myself unkindly banished,</li>
  <li>The gates shut on me, and turn’d weeping out,</li>
  <li>To beg relief among Rome’s enemies:</li>
  <li>Who drown’d their enmity in my true tears.</li>
  <li>And oped their arms to embrace me as a friend.</li>
  <li class="number">I am the turned forth, be it known to you,</li>
  <li>That have preserved her welfare in my blood;</li>
  <li>And from her bosom took the enemy’s point,</li>
  <li>Sheathing the steel in my adventurous body.</li>
  <li>Alas, you know I am no vaunter, I;</li>
  <li class="number">My scars can witness, dumb although they are,</li>
  <li>That my report is just and full of truth.</li>
  <li>But, soft! methinks I do digress too much,</li>
  <li>Citing my worthless praise: O, pardon me;</li>
  <li>For when no friends are by, men praise themselves.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li class="number">Now is my turn to speak. Behold this child:</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Pointing to the Child in the arms of an Attendant</li>
  <li>Of this was Tamora delivered;</li>
  <li>The issue of an irreligious Moor,</li>
  <li>Chief architect and plotter of these woes:</li>
  <li>The villain is alive in Titus’ house,</li>
  <li class="number">And as he is, to witness this is true.</li>
  <li>Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge</li>
  <li>These wrongs, unspeakable, past patience,</li>
  <li>Or more than any living man could bear.</li>
  <li>Now you have heard the truth, what say you, Romans?</li>
  <li class="number">Have we done aught amiss — show us wherein,</li>
  <li>And, from the place where you behold us now,</li>
  <li>The poor remainder of Andronici</li>
  <li>Will, hand in hand, all headlong cast us down.</li>
  <li>And on the ragged stones beat forth our brains,</li>
  <li class="number">And make a mutual closure of our house.</li>
  <li>Speak, Romans, speak; and if you say we shall,</li>
  <li>Lo, hand in hand, Lucius and I will fall.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AEMILIUS">
  <li>Come, come, thou reverend man of Rome,</li>
  <li>And bring our emperor gently in thy hand,</li>
  <li class="number">Lucius our emperor; for well I know</li>
  <li>The common voice do cry it shall be so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="All">
  <li>Lucius, all hail, Rome’s royal emperor!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>Go, go into old Titus’ sorrowful house,</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">To Attendants</li>
  <li>And hither hale that misbelieving Moor,</li>
  <li class="number">To be adjudged some direful slaughtering death,</li>
  <li>As punishment for his most wicked life.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt Attendants</div>

<div class="stage-direction">LUCIUS, MARCUS, and the others descend</div>

<ol data-speaker="All">
  <li>Lucius, all hail, Rome’s gracious governor!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIUS">
  <li>Thanks, gentle Romans: may I govern so,</li>
  <li>To heal Rome’s harms, and wipe away her woe!</li>
  <li class="number">But, gentle people, give me aim awhile,</li>
  <li>For nature puts me to a heavy task:</li>
  <li>Stand all aloof: but, uncle, draw you near,</li>
  <li>To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk.</li>
  <li>O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Kissing TITUS</li>
  <li class="number">These sorrowful drops upon thy blood-stain’d face,</li>
  <li>The last true duties of thy noble son!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARCUS ANDRONICUS">
  <li>Tear for tear, and loving kiss for kiss,</li>
  <li>Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips:</li>
  <li>O were the sum of these that I should pay</li>
  <li class="number">Countless and infinite, yet would I pay them!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIUS">
  <li>Come hither, boy; come, come, and learn of us</li>
  <li>To melt in showers: thy grandsire loved thee well:</li>
  <li>Many a time he danced thee on his knee,</li>
  <li>Sung thee asleep, his loving breast thy pillow:</li>
  <li class="number">Many a matter hath he told to thee,</li>
  <li>Meet and agreeing with thine infancy;</li>
  <li>In that respect, then, like a loving child,</li>
  <li>Shed yet some small drops from thy tender spring,</li>
  <li>Because kind nature doth require it so:</li>
  <li class="number">Friends should associate friends in grief and woe:</li>
  <li>Bid him farewell; commit him to the grave;</li>
  <li>Do him that kindness, and take leave of him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Young LUCIUS">
  <li>O grandsire, grandsire! even with all my heart</li>
  <li>Would I were dead, so you did live again!</li>
  <li class="number">O Lord, I cannot speak to him for weeping;</li>
  <li>My tears will choke me, if I ope my mouth.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Re-enter Attendants with AARON</div>

<ol data-speaker="AEMILIUS">
  <li>You sad Andronici, have done with woes:</li>
  <li>Give sentence on this execrable wretch,</li>
  <li>That hath been breeder of these dire events.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIUS">
  <li class="number">Set him breast-deep in earth, and famish him;</li>
  <li>There let him stand, and rave, and cry for food;</li>
  <li>If any one relieves or pities him,</li>
  <li>For the offence he dies. This is our doom:</li>
  <li>Some stay to see him fasten’d in the earth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AARON">
  <li class="number">O, why should wrath be mute, and fury dumb?</li>
  <li>I am no baby, I, that with base prayers</li>
  <li>I should repent the evils I have done:</li>
  <li>Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did</li>
  <li>Would I perform, if I might have my will;</li>
  <li class="number">If one good deed in all my life I did,</li>
  <li>I do repent it from my very soul.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIUS">
  <li>Some loving friends convey the emperor hence,</li>
  <li>And give him burial in his father’s grave:</li>
  <li>My father and Lavinia shall forthwith</li>
  <li class="number">Be closed in our household’s monument.</li>
  <li>As for that heinous tiger, Tamora,</li>
  <li>No funeral rite, nor man m mourning weeds,</li>
  <li>No mournful bell shall ring her burial;</li>
  <li>But throw her forth to beasts and birds of prey:</li>
  <li class="number">Her life was beast-like, and devoid of pity;</li>
  <li>And, being so, shall have like want of pity.</li>
  <li>See justice done on Aaron, that damn’d Moor,</li>
  <li>By whom our heavy haps had their beginning:</li>
  <li>Then, afterwards, to order well the state,</li>
  <li class="number">That like events may ne’er it ruinate.</li>
