<h3>SCENE I.  Westminster Abbey.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Dead March. Enter the Funeral of KING HENRY the
Fifth, attended on by Dukes of BEDFORD, Regent of
France; GLOUCESTER, Protector; and EXETER, Earl of
WARWICK, the BISHOP OF WINCHESTER, Heralds, etc.</div>

<ol data-speaker="BEDFORD">
  <li>Hung be the heavens with black, yield day to night!</li>
  <li>Comets, importing change of times and states,</li>
  <li>Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky,</li>
  <li>And with them scourge the bad revolting stars</li>
  <li class="number">That have consented unto Henry’s death!</li>
  <li>King Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long!</li>
  <li>England ne’er lost a king of so much worth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>England ne’er had a king until his time.</li>
  <li>Virtue he had, deserving to command:</li>
  <li class="number">His brandish’d sword did blind men with his beams:</li>
  <li>His arms spread wider than a dragon’s wings;</li>
  <li>His sparking eyes, replete with wrathful fire,</li>
  <li>More dazzled and drove back his enemies</li>
  <li>Than mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces.</li>
  <li class="number">What should I say? his deeds exceed all speech:</li>
  <li>He ne’er lift up his hand but conquered.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EXETER">
  <li>We mourn in black: why mourn we not in blood?</li>
  <li>Henry is dead and never shall revive:</li>
  <li>Upon a wooden coffin we attend,</li>
  <li class="number">And death’s dishonourable victory</li>
  <li>We with our stately presence glorify,</li>
  <li>Like captives bound to a triumphant car.</li>
  <li>What! shall we curse the planets of mishap</li>
  <li>That plotted thus our glory’s overthrow?</li>
  <li class="number">Or shall we think the subtle-witted French</li>
  <li>Conjurers and sorcerers, that afraid of him</li>
  <li>By magic verses have contrived his end?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BISHOP OF WINCHESTER">
  <li>He was a king bless’d of the King of kings.</li>
  <li>Unto the French the dreadful judgement-day</li>
  <li class="number">So dreadful will not be as was his sight.</li>
  <li>The battles of the Lord of hosts he fought:</li>
  <li>The church’s prayers made him so prosperous.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>The church! where is it? Had not churchmen pray’d,</li>
  <li>His thread of life had not so soon decay’d:</li>
  <li class="number">None do you like but an effeminate prince,</li>
  <li>Whom, like a school-boy, you may over-awe.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BISHOP OF WINCHESTER">
  <li>Gloucester, whate’er we like, thou art protector</li>
  <li>And lookest to command the prince and realm.</li>
  <li>Thy wife is proud; she holdeth thee in awe,</li>
  <li class="number">More than God or religious churchmen may.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>Name not religion, for thou lovest the flesh,</li>
  <li>And ne’er throughout the year to church thou go’st</li>
  <li>Except it be to pray against thy foes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEDFORD">
  <li>Cease, cease these jars and rest your minds in peace:</li>
  <li class="number">Let’s to the altar: heralds, wait on us:</li>
  <li>Instead of gold, we’ll offer up our arms:</li>
  <li>Since arms avail not now that Henry’s dead.</li>
  <li>Posterity, await for wretched years,</li>
  <li>When at their mothers’ moist eyes babes shall suck,</li>
  <li class="number">Our isle be made a nourish of salt tears,</li>
  <li>And none but women left to wail the dead.</li>
  <li>Henry the Fifth, thy ghost I invocate:</li>
  <li>Prosper this realm, keep it from civil broils,</li>
  <li>Combat with adverse planets in the heavens!</li>
  <li class="number">A far more glorious star thy soul will make</li>
  <li>Than Julius Caesar or bright — </li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter a Messenger</div>

<ol data-speaker="Messenger">
  <li>My honourable lords, health to you all!</li>
  <li>Sad tidings bring I to you out of France,</li>
  <li>Of loss, of slaughter and discomfiture:</li>
  <li class="number">Guienne, Champagne, Rheims, Orleans,</li>
  <li>Paris, Guysors, Poictiers, are all quite lost.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEDFORD">
  <li>What say’st thou, man, before dead Henry’s corse?</li>
  <li>Speak softly, or the loss of those great towns</li>
  <li>Will make him burst his lead and rise from death.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li class="number">Is Paris lost? is Rouen yielded up?</li>
  <li>If Henry were recall’d to life again,</li>
  <li>These news would cause him once more yield the ghost.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EXETER">
  <li>How were they lost? what treachery was used?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Messenger">
  <li>No treachery; but want of men and money.</li>
  <li class="number">Amongst the soldiers this is muttered,</li>
  <li>That here you maintain several factions,</li>
  <li>And whilst a field should be dispatch’d and fought,</li>
  <li>You are disputing of your generals:</li>
  <li>One would have lingering wars with little cost;</li>
  <li class="number">Another would fly swift, but wanteth wings;</li>
  <li>A third thinks, without expense at all,</li>
  <li>By guileful fair words peace may be obtain’d.</li>
  <li>Awake, awake, English nobility!</li>
  <li>Let not sloth dim your horrors new-begot:</li>
  <li class="number">Cropp’d are the flower-de-luces in your arms;</li>
  <li>Of England’s coat one half is cut away.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EXETER">
  <li>Were our tears wanting to this funeral,</li>
  <li>These tidings would call forth their flowing tides.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEDFORD">
  <li>Me they concern; Regent I am of France.</li>
  <li class="number">Give me my steeled coat. I’ll fight for France.</li>
  <li>Away with these disgraceful wailing robes!</li>
  <li>Wounds will I lend the French instead of eyes,</li>
  <li>To weep their intermissive miseries.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter to them another Messenger</div>

<ol data-speaker="Messenger">
  <li>Lords, view these letters full of bad mischance.</li>
  <li class="number">France is revolted from the English quite,</li>
  <li>Except some petty towns of no import:</li>
  <li>The Dauphin Charles is crowned king of Rheims;</li>
  <li>The Bastard of Orleans with him is join’d;</li>
  <li>Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part;</li>
  <li class="number">The Duke of Alencon flieth to his side.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EXETER">
  <li>The Dauphin crowned king! all fly to him!</li>
  <li>O, whither shall we fly from this reproach?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>We will not fly, but to our enemies’ throats.</li>
  <li>Bedford, if thou be slack, I’ll fight it out.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEDFORD">
  <li class="number">Gloucester, why doubt’st thou of my forwardness?</li>
  <li>An army have I muster’d in my thoughts,</li>
  <li>Wherewith already France is overrun.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter another Messenger</div>

<ol data-speaker="Messenger">
  <li>My gracious lords, to add to your laments,</li>
  <li>Wherewith you now bedew King Henry’s hearse,</li>
  <li class="number">I must inform you of a dismal fight</li>
  <li>Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BISHOP OF WINCHESTER">
  <li>What! wherein Talbot overcame? is’t so?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Messenger">
  <li>O, no; wherein Lord Talbot was o’erthrown:</li>
  <li>The circumstance I’ll tell you more at large.</li>
  <li class="number">The tenth of August last this dreadful lord,</li>
  <li>Retiring from the siege of Orleans,</li>
  <li>Having full scarce six thousand in his troop.</li>
  <li>By three and twenty thousand of the French</li>
  <li>Was round encompassed and set upon.</li>
  <li class="number">No leisure had he to enrank his men;</li>
  <li>He wanted pikes to set before his archers;</li>
  <li>Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck’d out of hedges</li>
  <li>They pitched in the ground confusedly,</li>
  <li>To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.</li>
  <li class="number">More than three hours the fight continued;</li>
  <li>Where valiant Talbot above human thought</li>
  <li>Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:</li>
  <li>Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;</li>
  <li>Here, there, and every where, enraged he flew:</li>
  <li class="number">The French exclaim’d, the devil was in arms;</li>
  <li>All the whole army stood agazed on him:</li>
  <li>His soldiers spying his undaunted spirit</li>
  <li>A Talbot! a Talbot! cried out amain</li>
  <li>And rush’d into the bowels of the battle.</li>
  <li class="number">Here had the conquest fully been seal’d up,</li>
  <li>If Sir John Fastolfe had not play’d the coward:</li>
  <li>He, being in the vaward, placed behind</li>
  <li>With purpose to relieve and follow them,</li>
  <li>Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke.</li>
  <li class="number">Hence grew the general wreck and massacre;</li>
  <li>Enclosed were they with their enemies:</li>
  <li>A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin’s grace,</li>
  <li>Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back,</li>
  <li>Whom all France with their chief assembled strength</li>
  <li class="number">Durst not presume to look once in the face.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEDFORD">
  <li>Is Talbot slain? then I will slay myself,</li>
  <li>For living idly here in pomp and ease,</li>
  <li>Whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid,</li>
  <li>Unto his dastard foemen is betray’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Messenger">
  <li class="number">O no, he lives; but is took prisoner,</li>
  <li>And Lord Scales with him and Lord Hungerford:</li>
  <li>Most of the rest slaughter’d or took likewise.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEDFORD">
  <li>His ransom there is none but I shall pay:</li>
  <li>I’ll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne:</li>
  <li class="number">His crown shall be the ransom of my friend;</li>
  <li>Four of their lords I’ll change for one of ours.</li>
  <li>Farewell, my masters; to my task will I;</li>
  <li>Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make,</li>
  <li>To keep our great Saint George’s feast withal:</li>
  <li class="number">Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take,</li>
  <li>Whose bloody deeds shall make all Europe quake.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Messenger">
  <li>So you had need; for Orleans is besieged;</li>
  <li>The English army is grown weak and faint:</li>
  <li>The Earl of Salisbury craveth supply,</li>
  <li class="number">And hardly keeps his men from mutiny,</li>
  <li>Since they, so few, watch such a multitude.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EXETER">
  <li>Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,</li>
  <li>Either to quell the Dauphin utterly,</li>
  <li>Or bring him in obedience to your yoke.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEDFORD">
  <li class="number">I do remember it; and here take my leave,</li>
  <li>To go about my preparation.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>I’ll to the Tower with all the haste I can,</li>
  <li>To view the artillery and munition;</li>
  <li>And then I will proclaim young Henry king.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<ol data-speaker="EXETER">
  <li class="number">To Eltham will I, where the young king is,</li>
  <li>Being ordain’d his special governor,</li>
  <li>And for his safety there I’ll best devise.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<ol data-speaker="BISHOP OF WINCHESTER">
  <li>Each hath his place and function to attend:</li>
  <li>I am left out; for me nothing remains.</li>
  <li class="number">But long I will not be Jack out of office:</li>
  <li>The king from Eltham I intend to steal</li>
  <li>And sit at chiefest stern of public weal.</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  France. Before Orleans.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Sound a flourish. Enter CHARLES, ALENCON, and
REIGNIER, marching with drum and Soldiers</div>

<ol data-speaker="CHARLES">
  <li>Mars his true moving, even as in the heavens</li>
  <li>So in the earth, to this day is not known:</li>
  <li>Late did he shine upon the English side;</li>
  <li>Now we are victors; upon us he smiles.</li>
  <li class="number">What towns of any moment but we have?</li>
  <li>At pleasure here we lie near Orleans;</li>
  <li>Otherwhiles the famish’d English, like pale ghosts,</li>
  <li>Faintly besiege us one hour in a month.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALENCON">
  <li>They want their porridge and their fat bull-beeves:</li>
  <li class="number">Either they must be dieted like mules</li>
  <li>And have their provender tied to their mouths</li>
  <li>Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="REIGNIER">
  <li>Let’s raise the siege: why live we idly here?</li>
  <li>Talbot is taken, whom we wont to fear:</li>
  <li class="number">Remaineth none but mad-brain’d Salisbury;</li>
  <li>And he may well in fretting spend his gall,</li>
  <li>Nor men nor money hath he to make war.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CHARLES">
  <li>Sound, sound alarum! we will rush on them.</li>
  <li>Now for the honour of the forlorn French!</li>

  <li>When he sees me go back one foot or fly.</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt</div>

<div class="stage-direction">Here alarum; they are beaten back by the English

<ol data-speaker="CHARLES">
  <li>Who ever saw the like? what men have I!</li>
  <li>Dogs! cowards! dastards! I would ne’er have fled,</li>

<ol data-speaker="REIGNIER">
  <li class="number">Salisbury is a desperate homicide;</li>
  <li>He fighteth as one weary of his life.</li>
  <li>The other lords, like lions wanting food,</li>
  <li>Do rush upon us as their hungry prey.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALENCON">
  <li>Froissart, a countryman of ours, records,</li>
  <li class="number">England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,</li>
  <li>During the time Edward the Third did reign.</li>
  <li>More truly now may this be verified;</li>
  <li>For none but Samsons and Goliases</li>

  <li class="number">Lean, raw-boned rascals! who would e’er suppose</li>
  <li>They had such courage and audacity?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CHARLES">
  <li>Let’s leave this town; for they are hare-brain’d slaves,</li>
  <li>And hunger will enforce them to be more eager:</li>

<ol data-speaker="REIGNIER">
  <li>I think, by some odd gimmors or device</li>

  <li class="number">The spirit of deep prophecy she hath,</li>

  <li>God’s mother deigned to appear to me</li>
  <li class="number">And in a vision full of majesty</li>

  <li>And I will answer unpremeditated:</li>
  <li class="number">My courage try by combat, if thou darest,</li>
  <li>And thou shalt find that I exceed my sex.</li>
  <li>Resolve on this, thou shalt be fortunate,</li>
  <li>If thou receive me for thy warlike mate.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CHARLES">
  <li>Thou hast astonish’d me with thy high terms:</li>
  <li class="number">Only this proof I’ll of thy valour make,</li>

  <li>The prince’s espials have informed me</li>
  <li>How the English, in the suburbs close intrench’d,</li>
  <li class="number">Wont, through a secret grate of iron bars</li>
  <li>In yonder tower, to overpeer the city,</li>

  <li>They may vex us with shot, or with assault.</li>
  <li>To intercept this inconvenience,</li>
  <li class="number">A piece of ordnance ’gainst it I have placed;</li>
  <li>And even these three days have I watch’d,</li>

  <li>How wert thou handled being prisoner?</li>
  <li class="number">Or by what means got’st thou to be released?</li>
  <li>Discourse, I prithee, on this turret’s top.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TALBOT">
  <li>The Duke of Bedford had a prisoner</li>
  <li>Call’d the brave Lord Ponton de Santrailles;</li>
  <li>For him was I exchanged and ransomed.</li>
  <li class="number">But with a baser man of arms by far</li>
  <li>Once in contempt they would have barter’d me:</li>
  <li>Which I, disdaining, scorn’d; and craved death,</li>
  <li>Rather than I would be so vile esteem’d.</li>
  <li>In fine, redeem’d I was as I desired.</li>
  <li class="number">But, O! the treacherous Fastolfe wounds my heart,</li>
  <li>Whom with my bare fists I would execute,</li>

  <li>To be a public spectacle to all:</li>
  <li>Here, said they, is the terror of the French,</li>
  <li>The scarecrow that affrights our children so.</li>
  <li>Then broke I from the officers that led me,</li>
  <li class="number">And with my nails digg’d stones out of the ground,</li>
  <li>To hurl at the beholders of my shame:</li>
  <li>My grisly countenance made others fly;</li>
  <li>None durst come near for fear of sudden death.</li>
  <li>In iron walls they deem’d me not secure;</li>
  <li class="number">So great fear of my name ’mongst them was spread,</li>
  <li>That they supposed I could rend bars of steel,</li>
  <li>And spurn in pieces posts of adamant:</li>
  <li>Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had,</li>
  <li>That walked about me every minute-while;</li>
  <li class="number">And if I did but stir out of my bed,</li>
  <li>Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter the Boy with a linstock</div>

<ol data-speaker="SALISBURY">
  <li>I grieve to hear what torments you endured,</li>

  <li>Henry the Fifth he first train’d to the wars;</li>
  <li class="number">Whilst any trump did sound, or drum struck up,</li>
  <li>His sword did ne’er leave striking in the field.</li>

  <li class="number">Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive,</li>
  <li>If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands!</li>
  <li>Bear hence his body; I will help to bury it.</li>
  <li>Sir Thomas Gargrave, hast thou any life?</li>
  <li>Speak unto Talbot; nay, look up to him.</li>
  <li class="number">Salisbury, cheer thy spirit with this comfort;</li>
  <li>Thou shalt not die whiles — </li>
  <li>He beckons with his hand and smiles on me.</li>
  <li>As who should say ’When I am dead and gone,</li>
  <li>Remember to avenge me on the French.’</li>
  <li class="number">Plantagenet, I will; and like thee, Nero,</li>
  <li>Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn:</li>

  <li>Great lords and gentlemen, what means this silence?</li>
  <li>Dare no man answer in a case of truth?</li>

<ol data-speaker="SUFFOLK">
  <li>Within the Temple-hall we were too loud;</li>
  <li>The garden here is more convenient.</li>

<ol data-speaker="RICHARD PLANTAGENET">
  <li class="number">Then say at once if I maintain’d the truth;</li>
  <li>Or else was wrangling Somerset in the error?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUFFOLK">
  <li>Faith, I have been a truant in the law,</li>

  <li>And therefore frame the law unto my will.</li>

<ol data-speaker="SOMERSET">

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>Between two hawks, which flies the higher pitch;</li>

  <li>Prick not your finger as you pluck it off,</li>

  <li class="number">They laboured to plant the rightful heir,</li>
  <li>I lost my liberty and they their lives.</li>

  <li class="number">But, as the rest, so fell that noble earl</li>

<ol data-speaker="MARGARET">
  <li>Why speak’st thou not? what ransom must I pay?</li>

<ol data-speaker="SUFFOLK">
  <li>She’s beautiful, and therefore to be woo’d;</li>
  <li>She is a woman, therefore to be won.</li>

<ol data-speaker="MARGARET">
  <li class="number">Wilt thou accept of ransom? yea, or no.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUFFOLK">
  <li>Fond man, remember that thou hast a wife;</li>
  <li>Then how can Margaret be thy paramour?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARGARET">
  <li>I were best to leave him, for he will not hear.</li>

  <li>There all is marr’d; there lies a cooling card.</li>

  <li>And yet I would that you would answer me.</li>

<ol data-speaker="SUFFOLK">
  <li>I’ll win this Lady Margaret. For whom?</li>
  <li>Why, for my king: tush, that’s a wooden thing!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARGARET">
  <li class="number">He talks of wood: it is some carpenter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUFFOLK">
  <li>Yet so my fancy may be satisfied,</li>
  <li>And peace established between these realms</li>
  <li>But there remains a scruple in that too;</li>
  <li>For though her father be the King of Naples,</li>
  <li class="number">Duke of Anjou and Maine, yet is he poor,</li>
  <li>And our nobility will scorn the match.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARGARET">
  <li>Hear ye, captain, are you not at leisure?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUFFOLK">
  <li>It shall be so, disdain they ne’er so much.</li>
  <li>Henry is youthful and will quickly yield.</li>
  <li class="number">Madam, I have a secret to reveal.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARGARET">
  <li>What though I be enthrall’d? he seems a knight,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUFFOLK">
  <li>Lady, vouchsafe to listen what I say.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARGARET">
  <li>Perhaps I shall be rescued by the French;</li>
  <li class="number">And then I need not crave his courtesy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUFFOLK">
  <li>Sweet madam, give me a hearing in a cause — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARGARET">
  <li>Tush, women have been captivate ere now.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUFFOLK">
  <li>Lady, wherefore talk you so?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARGARET">
  <li>I cry you mercy, ’tis but Quid for Quo.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUFFOLK">
  <li class="number">Say, gentle princess, would you not suppose</li>
  <li>Your bondage happy, to be made a queen?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARGARET">
  <li>To be a queen in bondage is more vile</li>
  <li>Than is a slave in base servility;</li>
  <li>For princes should be free.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUFFOLK">
  <li class="number">And so shall you,</li>
  <li>If happy England’s royal king be free.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARGARET">
  <li>Why, what concerns his freedom unto me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUFFOLK">
  <li>I’ll undertake to make thee Henry’s queen,</li>

  <li class="number">And set a precious crown upon thy head,</li>
  <li>If thou wilt condescend to be my — </li>

<ol data-speaker="SUFFOLK">
  <li>His love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARGARET">
  <li>I am unworthy to be Henry’s wife.</li>

  <li>How say you, madam, are ye so content?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARGARET">
  <li>An if my father please, I am content.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUFFOLK">
  <li class="number">Then call our captains and our colours forth.</li>

<ol data-speaker="REIGNIER">
  <li>Suffolk, what remedy?</li>
  <li>I am a soldier, and unapt to weep,</li>
  <li>Or to exclaim on fortune’s fickleness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUFFOLK">
  <li>Yes, there is remedy enough, my lord:</li>
  <li class="number">Consent, and for thy honour give consent,</li>
  <li>Thy daughter shall be wedded to my king;</li>
  <li>Whom I with pain have woo’d and won thereto;</li>
  <li>And this her easy-held imprisonment</li>

  <li class="number">What answer makes your grace unto my suit?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="REIGNIER">
  <li>Since thou dost deign to woo her little worth</li>
  <li>To be the princely bride of such a lord;</li>
  <li>Upon condition I may quietly</li>
  <li>Enjoy mine own, the country Maine and Anjou,</li>
  <li class="number">Free from oppression or the stroke of war,</li>
  <li>My daughter shall be Henry’s, if he please.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUFFOLK">
  <li>That is her ransom; I deliver her;</li>
  <li>And those two counties I will undertake</li>
  <li>Your grace shall well and quietly enjoy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="REIGNIER">
  <li class="number">And I again, in Henry’s royal name,</li>
  <li>As deputy unto that gracious king,</li>
  <li>Give thee her hand, for sign of plighted faith.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUFFOLK">
  <li>Reignier of France, I give thee kingly thanks,</li>
  <li>Because this is in traffic of a king.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Aside</li>
  <li class="number">And yet, methinks, I could be well content</li>
  <li>To be mine own attorney in this case.</li>
  <li>I’ll over then to England with this news,</li>

  <li>So farewell, Reignier: set this diamond safe</li>

  <li>Ah, Joan, sweet daughter Joan, I’ll die with thee!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JOAN LA PUCELLE">
  <li>Decrepit miser! base ignoble wretch!</li>
  <li>I am descended of a gentler blood:</li>
  <li>Thou art no father nor no friend of mine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Shepherd">
  <li class="number">Out, out! My lords, an please you, ’tis not so;</li>
  <li>I did beget her, all the parish knows:</li>
  <li>Her mother liveth yet, can testify</li>
  <li>She was the first fruit of my bachelorship.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK">
  <li>Graceless! wilt thou deny thy parentage?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK">
  <li class="number">This argues what her kind of life hath been,</li>

  <li>Fie, Joan, that thou wilt be so obstacle!</li>
  <li>God knows thou art a collop of my flesh;</li>

<ol data-speaker="JOAN LA PUCELLE">
  <li>Peasant, avaunt! You have suborn’d this man,</li>

<ol data-speaker="Shepherd">
  <li>’Tis true, I gave a noble to the priest</li>
  <li>The morn that I was wedded to her mother.</li>
  <li class="number">Kneel down and take my blessing, good my girl.</li>
  <li>Wilt thou not stoop? Now cursed be the time</li>
  <li>Of thy nativity! I would the milk</li>
  <li>Thy mother gave thee when thou suck’dst her breast,</li>
  <li>Had been a little ratsbane for thy sake!</li>
  <li class="number">Or else, when thou didst keep my lambs a-field,</li>
  <li>I wish some ravenous wolf had eaten thee!</li>

  <li>First, let me tell you whom you have condemn’d:</li>
  <li>Not me begotten of a shepherd swain,</li>
  <li>But issued from the progeny of kings;</li>
  <li>Virtuous and holy; chosen from above,</li>
  <li class="number">By inspiration of celestial grace,</li>
  <li>To work exceeding miracles on earth.</li>
  <li>I never had to do with wicked spirits:</li>
  <li>But you, that are polluted with your lusts,</li>

  <li>Because you want the grace that others have,</li>
  <li>You judge it straight a thing impossible</li>
  <li>To compass wonders but by help of devils.</li>
  <li>No, misconceived! Joan of Arc hath been</li>
  <li class="number">A virgin from her tender infancy,</li>
  <li>Chaste and immaculate in very thought;</li>
  <li>Whose maiden blood, thus rigorously effused,</li>
  <li>Will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven.</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JOAN LA PUCELLE">
  <li>Will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts?</li>

  <li>A married man! that’s most intolerable.</li>

  <li>Her virtues graced with external gifts</li>
  <li>Do breed love’s settled passions in my heart:</li>
  <li class="number">And like as rigor of tempestuous gusts</li>
  <li>Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide,</li>
  <li>So am I driven by breath of her renown</li>

  <li>Where I may have fruition of her love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUFFOLK">
  <li class="number">Tush, my good lord, this superficial tale</li>

  <li>By reason of his adversary’s odds:</li>
  <li>A poor earl’s daughter is unequal odds,</li>
  <li class="number">And therefore may be broke without offence.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>Why, what, I pray, is Margaret more than that?</li>
  <li>Her father is no better than an earl,</li>
  <li>Although in glorious titles he excel.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUFFOLK">
  <li>Yes, lord, her father is a king,</li>
  <li class="number">The King of Naples and Jerusalem;</li>
  <li>And of such great authority in France</li>
  <li>As his alliance will confirm our peace</li>
  <li>And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>And so the Earl of Armagnac may do,</li>
  <li class="number">Because he is near kinsman unto Charles.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EXETER">
  <li>Beside, his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower,</li>
  <li>Where Reignier sooner will receive than give.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUFFOLK">
  <li>A dower, my lords! disgrace not so your king,</li>
  <li>That he should be so abject, base and poor,</li>
  <li class="number">To choose for wealth and not for perfect love.</li>
  <li>Henry is able to enrich his queen</li>
  <li>And not seek a queen to make him rich:</li>
  <li>So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,</li>
  <li>As market-men for oxen, sheep, or horse.</li>
  <li class="number">Marriage is a matter of more worth</li>
  <li>Than to be dealt in by attorneyship;</li>
  <li>Not whom we will, but whom his grace affects,</li>
  <li>Must be companion of his nuptial bed:</li>
  <li>And therefore, lords, since he affects her most,</li>
  <li class="number">It most of all these reasons bindeth us,</li>
  <li>In our opinions she should be preferr’d.</li>
  <li>For what is wedlock forced but a hell,</li>
  <li>An age of discord and continual strife?</li>
  <li>Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss,</li>
  <li class="number">And is a pattern of celestial peace.</li>
  <li>Whom should we match with Henry, being a king,</li>
  <li>But Margaret, that is daughter to a king?</li>
  <li>Her peerless feature, joined with her birth,</li>
  <li>Approves her fit for none but for a king:</li>
  <li class="number">Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit,</li>
  <li>More than in women commonly is seen,</li>
  <li>Will answer our hope in issue of a king;</li>
  <li>For Henry, son unto a conqueror,</li>
  <li>Is likely to beget more conquerors,</li>
  <li class="number">If with a lady of so high resolve</li>
  <li>As is fair Margaret he be link’d in love.</li>
  <li>Then yield, my lords; and here conclude with me</li>
  <li>That Margaret shall be queen, and none but she.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING HENRY VI">
  <li>Whether it be through force of your report,</li>
  <li class="number">My noble Lord of Suffolk, or for that</li>
  <li>My tender youth was never yet attaint</li>
  <li>With any passion of inflaming love,</li>
  <li>I cannot tell; but this I am assured,</li>
  <li>I feel such sharp dissension in my breast,</li>
  <li class="number">Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear,</li>
  <li>As I am sick with working of my thoughts.</li>
  <li>Take, therefore, shipping; post, my lord, to France;</li>
  <li>Agree to any covenants, and procure</li>
  <li>That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come</li>
  <li class="number">To cross the seas to England and be crown’d</li>
  <li>King Henry’s faithful and anointed queen:</li>
  <li>For your expenses and sufficient charge,</li>
  <li>Among the people gather up a tenth.</li>
  <li>Be gone, I say; for, till you do return,</li>
  <li class="number">I rest perplexed with a thousand cares.</li>
  <li>And you, good uncle, banish all offence:</li>
  <li>If you do censure me by what you were,</li>
  <li>Not what you are, I know it will excuse</li>
  <li>This sudden execution of my will.</li>
  <li class="number">And so, conduct me where, from company,</li>
  <li>I may revolve and ruminate my grief.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>

<ol data-speaker="GLOUCESTER">
  <li>Ay, grief, I fear me, both at first and last.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EXETER</div>

<ol data-speaker="SUFFOLK">
  <li>Thus Suffolk hath prevail’d; and thus he goes,</li>
  <li>As did the youthful Paris once to Greece,</li>
  <li class="number">With hope to find the like event in love,</li>
  <li>But prosper better than the Trojan did.</li>
  <li>Margaret shall now be queen, and rule the king;</li>
  <li>But I will rule both her, the king and realm.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit</div>
