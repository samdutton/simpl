<h3>SCENE I.  Antioch. A room in the palace.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter ANTIOCHUS, Prince PERICLES, and followers</div>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIOCHUS">
  <li>Young prince of Tyre, you have at large received</li>
  <li>The danger of the task you undertake.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PERICLES">
  <li>I have, Antiochus, and, with a soul</li>
  <li>Embolden’d with the glory of her praise,</li>
  <li class="number">Think death no hazard in this enterprise.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIOCHUS">
  <li>Bring in our daughter, clothed like a bride,</li>
  <li>For the embracements even of Jove himself;</li>
  <li>At whose conception, till Lucina reign’d,</li>
  <li>Nature this dowry gave, to glad her presence,</li>
  <li class="number">The senate-house of planets all did sit,</li>
  <li>To knit in her their best perfections.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Music. Enter the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS</div>

<ol data-speaker="PERICLES">
  <li>See where she comes, apparell’d like the spring,</li>
  <li>Graces her subjects, and her thoughts the king</li>
  <li>Of every virtue gives renown to men!</li>
  <li class="number">Her face the book of praises, where is read</li>
  <li>Nothing but curious pleasures, as from thence</li>
  <li>Sorrow were ever razed and testy wrath</li>
  <li>Could never be her mild companion.</li>
  <li>You gods that made me man, and sway in love,</li>
  <li class="number">That have inflamed desire in my breast</li>
  <li>To taste the fruit of yon celestial tree,</li>
  <li>Or die in the adventure, be my helps,</li>
  <li>As I am son and servant to your will,</li>
  <li>To compass such a boundless happiness!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIOCHUS">
  <li class="number">Prince Pericles — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PERICLES">
  <li>That would be son to great Antiochus.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIOCHUS">
  <li>Before thee stands this fair Hesperides,</li>
  <li>With golden fruit, but dangerous to be touch’d;</li>
  <li>For death-like dragons here affright thee hard:</li>
  <li class="number">Her face, like heaven, enticeth thee to view</li>
  <li>Her countless glory, which desert must gain;</li>
  <li>And which, without desert, because thine eye</li>
  <li>Presumes to reach, all thy whole heap must die.</li>
  <li>Yon sometimes famous princes, like thyself,</li>
  <li class="number">Drawn by report, adventurous by desire,</li>
  <li>Tell thee, with speechless tongues and semblance pale,</li>
  <li>That without covering, save yon field of stars,</li>
  <li>Here they stand martyrs, slain in Cupid’s wars;</li>
  <li>And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist</li>
  <li class="number">For going on death’s net, whom none resist.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PERICLES">
  <li>Antiochus, I thank thee, who hath taught</li>
  <li>My frail mortality to know itself,</li>
  <li>And by those fearful objects to prepare</li>
  <li>This body, like to them, to what I must;</li>
  <li class="number">For death remember’d should be like a mirror,</li>
  <li>Who tells us life’s but breath, to trust it error.</li>
  <li>I’ll make my will then, and, as sick men do</li>
  <li>Who know the world, see heaven, but, feeling woe,</li>
  <li>Gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did;</li>
  <li class="number">So I bequeath a happy peace to you</li>
  <li>And all good men, as every prince should do;</li>
  <li>My riches to the earth from whence they came;</li>
  <li>But my unspotted fire of love to you.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">To the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS</li>
  <li>Thus ready for the way of life or death,</li>
  <li class="number">I wait the sharpest blow, Antiochus.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIOCHUS">
  <li>Scorning advice, read the conclusion then:</li>
  <li>Which read and not expounded, ’tis decreed,</li>
  <li>As these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Daughter">
  <li>Of all say’d yet, mayst thou prove prosperous!</li>
  <li class="number">Of all say’d yet, I wish thee happiness!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PERICLES">
  <li>Like a bold champion, I assume the lists,</li>
  <li>Nor ask advice of any other thought</li>
  <li>But faithfulness and courage.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">He reads the riddle</li>
  <li>I am no viper, yet I feed</li>
  <li class="number">On mother’s flesh which did me breed.</li>
  <li>I sought a husband, in which labour</li>
  <li>I found that kindness in a father:</li>
  <li>He’s father, son, and husband mild;</li>
  <li>I mother, wife, and yet his child.</li>
  <li class="number">How they may be, and yet in two,</li>
  <li>As you will live, resolve it you.</li>
  <li>Sharp physic is the last: but, O you powers</li>
  <li>That give heaven countless eyes to view men’s acts,</li>
  <li>Why cloud they not their sights perpetually,</li>
  <li class="number">If this be true, which makes me pale to read it?</li>
  <li>Fair glass of light, I loved you, and could still,</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Takes hold of the hand of the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS</li>
  <li>Were not this glorious casket stored with ill:</li>
  <li>But I must tell you, now my thoughts revolt</li>
  <li>For he’s no man on whom perfections wait</li>
  <li class="number">That, knowing sin within, will touch the gate.</li>
  <li>You are a fair viol, and your sense the strings;</li>
  <li>Who, finger’d to make man his lawful music,</li>
  <li>Would draw heaven down, and all the gods, to hearken:</li>
  <li>But being play’d upon before your time,</li>
  <li class="number">Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.</li>
  <li>Good sooth, I care not for you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIOCHUS">
  <li>Prince Pericles, touch not, upon thy life.</li>
  <li>For that’s an article within our law,</li>
  <li>As dangerous as the rest. Your time’s expired:</li>
  <li class="number">Either expound now, or receive your sentence.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PERICLES">
  <li>Great king,</li>
  <li>Few love to hear the sins they love to act;</li>
  <li>’Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it.</li>
  <li>Who has a book of all that monarchs do,</li>
  <li class="number">He’s more secure to keep it shut than shown:</li>
  <li>For vice repeated is like the wandering wind.</li>
  <li>Blows dust in other’s eyes, to spread itself;</li>
  <li>And yet the end of all is bought thus dear,</li>
  <li>The breath is gone, and the sore eyes see clear:</li>
  <li class="number">To stop the air would hurt them. The blind mole casts</li>
  <li>Copp’d hills towards heaven, to tell the earth is throng’d</li>
  <li>By man’s oppression; and the poor worm doth die for’t.</li>
  <li>Kings are earth’s gods; in vice their law’s</li>
  <li>their will;</li>
  <li class="number">And if Jove stray, who dares say Jove doth ill?</li>
  <li>It is enough you know; and it is fit,</li>
  <li>What being more known grows worse, to smother it.</li>
  <li>All love the womb that their first being bred,</li>
  <li>Then give my tongue like leave to love my head.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANTIOCHUS">
  <li class="number"><span class="stage-direction">Aside</span>  Heaven, that I had thy head! he has found</li>
  <li>the meaning:</li>
  <li>But I will gloze with him. — Young prince of Tyre,</li>
  <li>Though by the tenor of our strict edict,</li>
  <li>Your exposition misinterpreting,</li>
  <li class="number">We might proceed to cancel of your days;</li>
  <li>Yet hope, succeeding from so fair a tree</li>
  <li>As your fair self, doth tune us otherwise:</li>
  <li>Forty days longer we do respite you;</li>
  <li>If by which time our secret be undone,</li>
  <li class="number">This mercy shows we’ll joy in such a son:</li>
  <li>And until then your entertain shall be</li>
  <li>As doth befit our honour and your worth.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exeunt all but PERICLES</div>

<ol data-speaker="PERICLES">
  <li>How courtesy would seem to cover sin,</li>
  <li>When what is done is like an hypocrite,</li>
  <li class="number">The which is good in nothing but in sight!</li>
  <li>If it be true that I interpret false,</li>
  <li>Then were it certain you were not so bad</li>
  <li>As with foul incest to abuse your soul;</li>
  <li>Where now you’re both a father and a son,</li>
  <li class="number">By your untimely claspings with your child,</li>
  <li>Which pleasure fits an husband, not a father;</li>
  <li>And she an eater of her mother’s flesh,</li>
  <li>By the defiling of her parent’s bed;</li>
  <li>And both like serpents are, who though they feed</li>
  <li class="number">On sweetest flowers, yet they poison breed.</li>
  <li>Antioch, farewell! for wisdom sees, those men</li>
  <li>Blush not in actions blacker than the night,</li>
  <li>Will shun no course to keep them from the light.</li>
  <li>One sin, I know, another doth provoke;</li>
  <li class="number">Murder’s as near to lust as flame to smoke:</li>
  <li>Poison and treason are the hands of sin,</li>
  <li>Ay, and the targets, to put off the shame:</li>
  <li>Then, lest my lie be cropp’d to keep you clear,</li>
  <li>By flight I’ll shun the danger which I fear.</li>

<ol data-speaker="PERICLES">
  <li><stagedir>To Lords without</stagedir>  Let none disturb us. — Why should</li>
  <li>this change of thoughts,</li>
  <li>The sad companion, dull-eyed melancholy,</li>
  <li>Be my so used a guest as not an hour,</li>
  <li class="number">In the day’s glorious walk, or peaceful night,</li>
  <li>The tomb where grief should sleep, can breed me quiet?</li>
  <li>Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,</li>
  <li>And danger, which I fear’d, is at Antioch,</li>
  <li>Whose aim seems far too short to hit me here:</li>
  <li class="number">Yet neither pleasure’s art can joy my spirits,</li>
  <li>Nor yet the other’s distance comfort me.</li>
  <li>Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,</li>
  <li>That have their first conception by mis-dread,</li>
  <li>Have after-nourishment and life by care;</li>
  <li class="number">And what was first but fear what might be done,</li>
  <li>Grows elder now and cares it be not done.</li>
  <li>And so with me: the great Antiochus,</li>
  <li>’Gainst whom I am too little to contend,</li>
  <li>Since he’s so great can make his will his act,</li>
  <li class="number">Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence;</li>
  <li>Nor boots it me to say I honour him.</li>
  <li>If he suspect I may dishonour him:</li>
  <li>And what may make him blush in being known,</li>
  <li>He’ll stop the course by which it might be known;</li>
  <li class="number">With hostile forces he’ll o’erspread the land,</li>
  <li>And with the ostent of war will look so huge,</li>
  <li>Amazement shall drive courage from the state;</li>
  <li>Our men be vanquish’d ere they do resist,</li>
  <li>And subjects punish’d that ne’er thought offence:</li>
  <li class="number">Which care of them, not pity of myself,</li>
  <li>Who am no more but as the tops of trees,</li>
  <li>Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them,</li>
  <li>Makes both my body pine and soul to languish,</li>

  <li class="number">Who seem’d my good protector; and, being here,</li>

  <li>How many worthy princes’ bloods were shed,</li>
  <li>To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope,</li>

  <li class="number">When all, for mine, if I may call offence,</li>

<ol data-speaker="CLEON">
  <li>My Dionyza, shall we rest us here,</li>
  <li>And by relating tales of others’ griefs,</li>
  <li>See if ’twill teach us to forget our own?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DIONYZA">
  <li>That were to blow at fire in hope to quench it;</li>
  <li class="number">For who digs hills because they do aspire</li>
  <li>Throws down one mountain to cast up a higher.</li>
  <li>O my distressed lord, even such our griefs are;</li>
  <li>Here they’re but felt, and seen with mischief’s eyes,</li>
  <li>But like to groves, being topp’d, they higher rise.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLEON">
  <li class="number">O Dionyza,</li>
  <li>Who wanteth food, and will not say he wants it,</li>
  <li>Or can conceal his hunger till he famish?</li>
  <li>Our tongues and sorrows do sound deep</li>
  <li>Our woes into the air; our eyes do weep,</li>
  <li class="number">Till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder;</li>
  <li>That, if heaven slumber while their creatures want,</li>
  <li>They may awake their helps to comfort them.</li>
  <li>I’ll then discourse our woes, felt several years,</li>
  <li>And wanting breath to speak help me with tears.</li>
</ol>

  <li class="number">I’ll do my best, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLEON">
  <li>This Tarsus, o’er which I have the government,</li>
  <li>A city on whom plenty held full hand,</li>
  <li>For riches strew’d herself even in the streets;</li>
  <li>Whose towers bore heads so high they kiss’d the clouds,</li>
  <li class="number">And strangers ne’er beheld but wondered at;</li>
  <li>Whose men and dames so jetted and adorn’d,</li>
  <li>Like one another’s glass to trim them by:</li>
  <li>Their tables were stored full, to glad the sight,</li>
  <li>And not so much to feed on as delight;</li>
  <li class="number">All poverty was scorn’d, and pride so great,</li>
  <li>The name of help grew odious to repeat.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DIONYZA">
  <li>O, ’tis too true.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLEON">
  <li>But see what heaven can do! By this our change,</li>
  <li>These mouths, who but of late, earth, sea, and air,</li>
  <li class="number">Were all too little to content and please,</li>
  <li>Although they gave their creatures in abundance,</li>
  <li>As houses are defiled for want of use,</li>
  <li>They are now starved for want of exercise:</li>
  <li>Those palates who, not yet two summers younger,</li>
  <li class="number">Must have inventions to delight the taste,</li>
  <li>Would now be glad of bread, and beg for it:</li>
  <li>Those mothers who, to nousle up their babes,</li>

  <li>To eat those little darlings whom they loved.</li>
  <li class="number">So sharp are hunger’s teeth, that man and wife</li>
  <li>Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life:</li>
  <li>Here stands a lord, and there a lady weeping;</li>
  <li>Here many sink, yet those which see them fall</li>
  <li>Have scarce strength left to give them burial.</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DIONYZA">
  <li>Our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it.</li>

  <li>O, let those cities that of plenty’s cup</li>

  <li>I thought as much.</li>
  <li>One sorrow never comes but brings an heir,</li>
  <li>That may succeed as his inheritor;</li>
  <li class="number">And so in ours: some neighbouring nation,</li>
  <li>Taking advantage of our misery,</li>
  <li>Hath stuff’d these hollow vessels with their power,</li>
  <li>To beat us down, the which are down already;</li>
  <li>And make a conquest of unhappy me,</li>
  <li class="number">Whereas no glory’s got to overcome.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Lord">
  <li>That’s the least fear; for, by the semblance</li>
  <li>Of their white flags display’d, they bring us peace,</li>
  <li>And come to us as favourers, not as foes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLEON">
  <li>Thou speak’st like him’s untutor’d to repeat:</li>

  <li>But bring they what they will and what they can,</li>
  <li>What need we fear?</li>
  <li>The ground’s the lowest, and we are half way there.</li>
  <li>Go tell their general we attend him here,</li>

  <li>Look how thou stirrest now! come away, or I’ll</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Third Fisherman">
  <li>Faith, master, I am thinking of the poor men that</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Fisherman">
  <li class="number">Alas, poor souls, it grieved my heart to hear what</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Third Fisherman">
  <li>Nay, master, said not I as much when I saw the</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="First Fisherman">
  <li>Why, as men do a-land; the great ones eat up the</li>

  <li class="number">nothing so fitly as to a whale; a’ plays and</li>
  <li>tumbles, driving the poor fry before him, and at</li>
  <li>last devours them all at a mouthful: such whales</li>
  <li>have I heard on o’ the land, who never leave gaping</li>

<ol data-speaker="Second Fisherman">
  <li>Why, man?</li>

  <li>left, till he cast bells, steeple, church, and</li>

<ol data-speaker="BOULT">
  <li>Sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Pandar">
  <li>Search the market narrowly; Mytilene is full of</li>
  <li>gallants. We lost too much money this mart by being</li>
  <li class="number">too wenchless.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Bawd">
  <li>We were never so much out of creatures. We have but</li>
  <li>poor three, and they can do no more than they can</li>

  <li>Therefore let’s have fresh ones, whate’er we pay for</li>

<ol data-speaker="Bawd">
  <li>Thou sayest true: ’tis not our bringing up of poor</li>
  <li>bastards — as, I think, I have brought up some eleven — </li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOULT">
  <li>Ay, to eleven; and brought them down again. But</li>
  <li class="number">shall I search the market?</li>

<ol data-speaker="Bawd">
  <li>What else, man? The stuff we have, a strong wind</li>
  <li>will blow it to pieces, they are so pitifully sodden.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Pandar">
  <li>Thou sayest true; they’re too unwholesome, o’</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOULT">

<ol data-speaker="Pandar">
  <li>O, our credit comes not in like the commodity, nor</li>
  <li>the commodity wages not with the danger: therefore,</li>

  <li>’Faith, they listened to me as they would have</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Bawd">
  <li>Well, well; as for him, he brought his disease</li>
  <li>hither: here he does but repair it. I know he will</li>

<ol data-speaker="Bawd">
  <li><stagedir>To MARINA</stagedir>  Pray you, come hither awhile. You</li>

  <li>To weep that you live as ye do makes pity in your</li>

  <li class="number">I understand you not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOULT">
  <li>O, take her home, mistress, take her home: these</li>

  <li>Thou sayest true, i’ faith, so they must; for your</li>

  <li class="number">My daughter might have been: my queen’s square brows;</li>
  <li>Her stature to an inch; as wand-like straight;</li>
  <li>As silver-voiced; her eyes as jewel-like</li>
  <li>And cased as richly; in pace another Juno;</li>
  <li>Who starves the ears she feeds, and makes them hungry,</li>
  <li class="number">The more she gives them speech. Where do you live?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARINA">
  <li>Where I am but a stranger: from the deck</li>
  <li>You may discern the place.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PERICLES">
  <li>Where were you bred?</li>
  <li>And how achieved you these endowments, which</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARINA">
  <li>If I should tell my history, it would seem</li>

<ol data-speaker="PERICLES">
  <li>Prithee, speak:</li>
  <li>Falseness cannot come from thee; for thou look’st</li>
  <li class="number">Modest as Justice, and thou seem’st a palace</li>
  <li>For the crown’d Truth to dwell in: I will</li>
  <li>believe thee,</li>
  <li>And make my senses credit thy relation</li>
  <li>To points that seem impossible; for thou look’st</li>
  <li class="number">Like one I loved indeed. What were thy friends?</li>
  <li>Didst thou not say, when I did push thee back — </li>
  <li>Which was when I perceived thee — that thou camest</li>
  <li>From good descending?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARINA">
  <li>So indeed I did.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PERICLES">
  <li class="number">Report thy parentage. I think thou said’st</li>

  <li>If both were open’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARINA">
  <li>Some such thing</li>
  <li class="number">I said, and said no more but what my thoughts</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PERICLES">
  <li>Tell thy story;</li>
  <li>If thine consider’d prove the thousandth part</li>

  <li class="number">Have suffer’d like a girl: yet thou dost look</li>
  <li>Like Patience gazing on kings’ graves, and smiling</li>
  <li>Extremity out of act. What were thy friends?</li>
  <li>How lost thou them? Thy name, my most kind virgin?</li>
  <li>Recount, I do beseech thee: come, sit by me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARINA">
  <li class="number">My name is Marina.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PERICLES">
  <li>O, I am mock’d,</li>

  <li>To make the world to laugh at me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARINA">
  <li>Patience, good sir,</li>
  <li class="number">Or here I’ll cease.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PERICLES">
  <li>Nay, I’ll be patient.</li>
  <li>Thou little know’st how thou dost startle me,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARINA">
  <li>The name</li>

  <li>How! a king’s daughter?</li>
  <li>And call’d Marina?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARINA">
  <li>You said you would believe me;</li>
  <li class="number">But, not to be a troubler of your peace,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PERICLES">
  <li>But are you flesh and blood?</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARINA">
  <li>Call’d Marina</li>
  <li>For I was born at sea.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PERICLES">
  <li>At sea! what mother?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARINA">
  <li>My mother was the daughter of a king;</li>
  <li class="number">Who died the minute I was born,</li>
  <li>As my good nurse Lychorida hath oft</li>
  <li>Deliver’d weeping.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PERICLES">
  <li>O, stop there a little!</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Aside</li>
  <li>This is the rarest dream that e’er dull sleep</li>

<ol data-speaker="PERICLES">
  <li class="number">I will believe you by the syllable</li>
  <li>Of what you shall deliver. Yet, give me leave:</li>
  <li>How came you in these parts? where were you bred?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARINA">
  <li>The king my father did in Tarsus leave me;</li>
  <li>Till cruel Cleon, with his wicked wife,</li>

  <li>A villain to attempt it, who having drawn to do’t,</li>
  <li>A crew of pirates came and rescued me;</li>
  <li>Brought me to Mytilene. But, good sir,</li>
  <li>Whither will you have me? Why do you weep?</li>
  <li class="number">It may be,</li>
  <li>You think me an impostor: no, good faith;</li>
  <li>I am the daughter to King Pericles,</li>
  <li>If good King Pericles be.</li>

  <li>What was thy mother’s name? tell me but that,</li>
  <li>For truth can never be confirm’d enough,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARINA">
  <li>First, sir, I pray,</li>
  <li class="number">What is your title?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PERICLES">
  <li>I am Pericles of Tyre: but tell me now</li>

  <li>The heir of kingdoms and another like</li>
  <li class="number">To Pericles thy father.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MARINA">
  <li>Is it no more to be your daughter than</li>
  <li>To say my mother’s name was Thaisa?</li>
  <li>Thaisa was my mother, who did end</li>
  <li>The minute I began.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PERICLES">
  <li class="number">Now, blessing on thee! rise; thou art my child.</li>
  <li>Give me fresh garments. Mine own, Helicanus;</li>

  <li>By savage Cleon: she shall tell thee all;</li>
  <li>When thou shalt kneel, and justify in knowledge</li>
  <li class="number">She is thy very princess. Who is this?</li>

<ol data-speaker="HELICANUS">
  <li>Sir, ’tis the governor of Mytilene,</li>

  <li>O heavens bless my girl! But, hark, what music?</li>
  <li>Tell Helicanus, my Marina, tell him</li>
  <li>O’er, point by point, for yet he seems to doubt,</li>
  <li>How sure you are my daughter. But, what music?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HELICANUS">
  <li class="number">My lord, I hear none.</li>

<h3>SCENE III.  The temple of Diana at Ephesus; THAISA standing near the altar, as high priestess; a number of Virgins on each side; CERIMON and other Inhabitants of Ephesus attending.</h3>

<ol data-speaker="PERICLES">
  <li>Hail, Dian! to perform thy just command,</li>
  <li>I here confess myself the king of Tyre;</li>
  <li>Who, frighted from my country, did wed</li>
  <li>At Pentapolis the fair Thaisa.</li>
  <li class="number">At sea in childbed died she, but brought forth</li>
  <li>A maid-child call’d Marina; who, O goddess,</li>
  <li>Wears yet thy silver livery. She at Tarsus</li>
  <li>Was nursed with Cleon; who at fourteen years</li>
  <li>He sought to murder: but her better stars</li>
  <li class="number">Brought her to Mytilene; ’gainst whose shore</li>
  <li>Riding, her fortunes brought the maid aboard us,</li>
  <li>Where, by her own most clear remembrance, she</li>
  <li>Made known herself my daughter.</li>

  <li>If you have told Diana’s altar true,</li>
  <li>This is your wife.</li>

<ol data-speaker="PERICLES">
  <li class="number">Reverend appearer, no;</li>

  <li>Look to the lady; O, she’s but o’erjoy’d.</li>

  <li>May we see them?</li>

  <li>O, let me look!</li>
  <li>If he be none of mine, my sanctity</li>
