<h3>SCENE I.  London. The palace.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter KING HENRY, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER, the EARL
of WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and others</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY IV</li>
  <li>So shaken as we are, so wan with care,</li>
  <li>Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,</li>
  <li>And breathe short-winded accents of new broils</li>
  <li>To be commenced in strands afar remote.</li>
  <li class="number">No more the thirsty entrance of this soil</li>
  <li>Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;</li>
  <li>Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,</li>
  <li>Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs</li>
  <li>Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,</li>
  <li class="number">Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,</li>
  <li>All of one nature, of one substance bred,</li>
  <li>Did lately meet in the intestine shock</li>
  <li>And furious close of civil butchery</li>
  <li>Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,</li>
  <li class="number">March all one way and be no more opposed</li>
  <li>Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:</li>
  <li>The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,</li>
  <li>No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,</li>
  <li>As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross</li>
  <li>We are impressed and engaged to fight,</li>
  <li>Forthwith a power of English shall we levy;</li>
  <li>Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb</li>
  <li>To chase these pagans in those holy fields</li>
  <li class="number">Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet</li>
  <li>Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd</li>
  <li>For our advantage on the bitter cross.</li>
  <li>But this our purpose now is twelve month old,</li>
  <li>And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:</li>
  <li class="number">Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear</li>
  <li>Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,</li>
  <li>What yesternight our council did decree</li>
  <li>In forwarding this dear expedience.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</li>
  <li>My liege, this haste was hot in question,</li>
  <li class="number">And many limits of the charge set down</li>
  <li>But yesternight: when all athwart there came</li>
  <li>A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;</li>
  <li>Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,</li>
  <li>Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight</li>
  <li class="number">Against the irregular and wild Glendower,</li>
  <li>Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,</li>
  <li>A thousand of his people butchered;</li>
  <li>Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,</li>
  <li>Such beastly shameless transformation,</li>
  <li class="number">By those Welshwomen done as may not be</li>
  <li>Without much shame retold or spoken of.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY IV</li>
  <li>It seems then that the tidings of this broil</li>
  <li>Brake off our business for the Holy Land.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</li>
  <li>This match'd with other did, my gracious lord;</li>
  <li class="number">For more uneven and unwelcome news</li>
  <li>Came from the north and thus it did import:</li>
  <li>On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,</li>
  <li>Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald,</li>
  <li>That ever-valiant and approved Scot,</li>
  <li class="number">At Holmedon met,</li>
  <li>Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,</li>
  <li>As by discharge of their artillery,</li>
  <li>And shape of likelihood, the news was told;</li>
  <li>For he that brought them, in the very heat</li>
  <li class="number">And pride of their contention did take horse,</li>
  <li>Uncertain of the issue any way.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY IV</li>
  <li>Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,</li>
  <li>Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse.</li>
  <li>Stain'd with the variation of each soil</li>
  <li class="number">Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;</li>
  <li>And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.</li>
  <li>The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:</li>
  <li>Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,</li>
  <li>Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see</li>
  <li class="number">On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took</li>
  <li>Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son</li>
  <li>To beaten Douglas; and the Earl of Athol,</li>
  <li>Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith:</li>
  <li>And is not this an honourable spoil?</li>
  <li class="number">A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</li>
  <li>In faith,</li>
  <li>It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY IV</li>
  <li>Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin</li>
  <li>In envy that my Lord Northumberland</li>
  <li class="number">Should be the father to so blest a son,</li>
  <li>A son who is the theme of honour's tongue;</li>
  <li>Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant;</li>
  <li>Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:</li>
  <li>Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,</li>
  <li class="number">See riot and dishonour stain the brow</li>
  <li>Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved</li>
  <li>That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged</li>
  <li>In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,</li>
  <li>And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!</li>
  <li class="number">Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.</li>
  <li>But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,</li>
  <li>Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,</li>
  <li>Which he in this adventure hath surprised,</li>
  <li>To his own use he keeps; and sends me word,</li>
  <li class="number">I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</li>
  <li>This is his uncle's teaching; this is Worcester,</li>
  <li>Malevolent to you in all aspects;</li>
  <li>Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up</li>
  <li>The crest of youth against your dignity.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY IV</li>
  <li class="number">But I have sent for him to answer this;</li>
  <li>And for this cause awhile we must neglect</li>
  <li>Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.</li>
  <li>Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we</li>
  <li>Will hold at Windsor; so inform the lords:</li>
  <li class="number">But come yourself with speed to us again;</li>
  <li>For more is to be said and to be done</li>
  <li>Than out of anger can be uttered.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</li>
  <li>I will, my liege.</li>

<h3>SCENE II.  London. An apartment of the Prince's.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter the PRINCE OF WALES and FALSTAFF</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack</li>
  <li>and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon</li>
  <li>benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to</li>
  <li class="number">demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know.</li>
  <li>What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the</li>
  <li>day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes</li>
  <li>capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the</li>
  <li>signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself</li>
  <li class="number">a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no</li>
  <li>reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand</li>
  <li>the time of the day.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>Indeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that take</li>
  <li>purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not</li>
  <li class="number">by Phoebus, he,'that wandering knight so fair.' And,</li>
  <li>I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God</li>
  <li>save thy grace —  majesty I should say, for grace</li>
  <li>thou wilt have none —  </li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>What, none?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li class="number">No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to</li>
  <li>prologue to an egg and butter.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not</li>
  <li>us that are squires of the night's body be called</li>
  <li class="number">thieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's</li>
  <li>foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the</li>
  <li>moon; and let men say we be men of good government,</li>
  <li>being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and</li>
  <li>chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li class="number">Thou sayest well, and it holds well too; for the</li>
  <li>fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and</li>
  <li>flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is,</li>
  <li>by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold</li>
  <li>most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most</li>
  <li class="number">dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with</li>
  <li>swearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in;'</li>
  <li>now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder</li>
  <li>and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not my</li>
  <li class="number">hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And</li>
  <li>is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and</li>
  <li>thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a</li>
  <li class="number">buff jerkin?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a</li>
  <li>time and oft.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li class="number">No; I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch;</li>
  <li>and where it would not, I have used my credit.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent</li>
  <li>that thou art heir apparent — But, I prithee, sweet</li>
  <li class="number">wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when</li>
  <li>thou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is</li>
  <li>with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do</li>
  <li>not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>No; thou shalt.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li class="number">Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>Thou judgest false already: I mean, thou shalt have</li>
  <li>the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my</li>
  <li>humour as well as waiting in the court, I can tell</li>
  <li class="number">you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>For obtaining of suits?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman</li>
  <li>hath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy</li>
  <li>as a gib cat or a lugged bear.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li class="number">Or an old lion, or a lover's lute.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of</li>
  <li>Moor-ditch?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed</li>
  <li class="number">the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young</li>
  <li>prince. But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more</li>
  <li>with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a</li>
  <li>commodity of good names were to be bought. An old</li>
  <li>lord of the council rated me the other day in the</li>
  <li class="number">street about you, sir, but I marked him not; and yet</li>
  <li>he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not; and</li>
  <li>yet he talked wisely, and in the street too.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the</li>
  <li>streets, and no man regards it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li class="number">O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able</li>
  <li>to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon</li>
  <li>me, Hal; God forgive thee for it! Before I knew</li>
  <li>thee, Hal, I knew nothing; and now am I, if a man</li>
  <li>should speak truly, little better than one of the</li>
  <li class="number">wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give</li>
  <li>it over: by the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain:</li>
  <li>I'll be damned for never a king's son in</li>
  <li>Christendom.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li class="number">'Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I'll make one; an I</li>
  <li>do not, call me villain and baffle me.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>I see a good amendment of life in thee; from praying</li>
  <li>to purse-taking.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal; 'tis no sin for a</li>
  <li class="number">man to labour in his vocation.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter POINS</li>
  <li>Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a</li>
  <li>match. O, if men were to be saved by merit, what</li>
  <li>hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the</li>
  <li>most omnipotent villain that ever cried 'Stand' to</li>
  <li class="number">a true man.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>Good morrow, Ned.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POINS</li>
  <li>Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse?</li>
  <li>what says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack! how</li>
  <li>agrees the devil and thee about thy soul, that thou</li>
  <li class="number">soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira</li>
  <li>and a cold capon's leg?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have</li>
  <li>his bargain; for he was never yet a breaker of</li>
  <li>proverbs: he will give the devil his due.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POINS</li>
  <li class="number">Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>Else he had been damned for cozening the devil.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POINS</li>
  <li>But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four</li>
  <li>o'clock, early at Gadshill! there are pilgrims going</li>
  <li>to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders</li>
  <li class="number">riding to London with fat purses: I have vizards</li>
  <li>for you all; you have horses for yourselves:</li>
  <li>Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester: I have bespoke</li>
  <li>supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we may do it</li>
  <li>as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff</li>
  <li class="number">your purses full of crowns; if you will not, tarry</li>
  <li>at home and be hanged.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>Hear ye, Yedward; if I tarry at home and go not,</li>
  <li>I'll hang you for going.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POINS</li>
  <li>You will, chops?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li class="number">Hal, wilt thou make one?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good</li>
  <li>fellowship in thee, nor thou camest not of the blood</li>
  <li>royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li class="number">Well then, once in my days I'll be a madcap.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>Why, that's well said.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>Well, come what will, I'll tarry at home.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>By the Lord, I'll be a traitor then, when thou art king.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>I care not.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POINS</li>
  <li class="number">Sir John, I prithee, leave the prince and me alone:</li>
  <li>I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure</li>
  <li>that he shall go.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him</li>
  <li>the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may</li>
  <li class="number">move and what he hears may be believed, that the</li>
  <li>true prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false</li>
  <li>thief; for the poor abuses of the time want</li>
  <li>countenance. Farewell: you shall find me in Eastcheap.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>Farewell, thou latter spring! farewell, All-hallown summer!</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit Falstaff</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POINS</li>
  <li class="number">Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us</li>
  <li>to-morrow: I have a jest to execute that I cannot</li>
  <li>manage alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto and Gadshill</li>
  <li>shall rob those men that we have already waylaid:</li>
  <li>yourself and I will not be there; and when they</li>
  <li class="number">have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut</li>
  <li>this head off from my shoulders.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>How shall we part with them in setting forth?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POINS</li>
  <li>Why, we will set forth before or after them, and</li>
  <li>appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at</li>
  <li class="number">our pleasure to fail, and then will they adventure</li>
  <li>upon the exploit themselves; which they shall have</li>
  <li>no sooner achieved, but we'll set upon them.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>Yea, but 'tis like that they will know us by our</li>
  <li>horses, by our habits and by every other</li>
  <li class="number">appointment, to be ourselves.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">POINS</li>
  <li>Tut! our horses they shall not see: I'll tie them</li>
  <li>in the wood; our vizards we will change after we</li>
  <li>leave them: and, sirrah, I have cases of buckram</li>

  <li>The moody frontier of a servant brow.</li>
  <li class="number">You have good leave to leave us: when we need</li>

  <li>Yea, my good lord.</li>
  <li>Those prisoners in your highness' name demanded,</li>
  <li class="number">Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,</li>
  <li>Were, as he says, not with such strength denied</li>
  <li>As is deliver'd to your majesty:</li>
  <li>Either envy, therefore, or misprison</li>
  <li>Is guilty of this fault and not my son.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HOTSPUR</li>
  <li class="number">My liege, I did deny no prisoners.</li>
  <li>But I remember, when the fight was done,</li>
  <li>When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,</li>
  <li>Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,</li>
  <li>Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress'd,</li>
  <li class="number">Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin new reap'd</li>
  <li>Show'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home;</li>
  <li>He was perfumed like a milliner;</li>
  <li>And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held</li>
  <li>A pouncet-box, which ever and anon</li>
  <li class="number">He gave his nose and took't away again;</li>
  <li>Who therewith angry, when it next came there,</li>
  <li>Took it in snuff; and still he smiled and talk'd,</li>
  <li>And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,</li>
  <li>He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,</li>
  <li class="number">To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse</li>
  <li>Betwixt the wind and his nobility.</li>
  <li>With many holiday and lady terms</li>
  <li>He question'd me; amongst the rest, demanded</li>
  <li>My prisoners in your majesty's behalf.</li>
  <li class="number">I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,</li>
  <li>To be so pester'd with a popinjay,</li>
  <li>Out of my grief and my impatience,</li>
  <li>Answer'd neglectingly I know not what,</li>
  <li>He should or he should not; for he made me mad</li>
  <li class="number">To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet</li>
  <li>And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman</li>
  <li>Of guns and drums and wounds —  God save the mark! — </li>
  <li>And telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth</li>
  <li>Was parmaceti for an inward bruise;</li>
  <li class="number">And that it was great pity, so it was,</li>
  <li>This villanous salt-petre should be digg'd</li>
  <li>Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,</li>
  <li>Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd</li>
  <li>So cowardly; and but for these vile guns,</li>
  <li class="number">He would himself have been a soldier.</li>
  <li>This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,</li>
  <li>I answer'd indirectly, as I said;</li>
  <li>And I beseech you, let not his report</li>
  <li>Come current for an accusation</li>
  <li class="number">Betwixt my love and your high majesty.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SIR WALTER BLUNT</li>
  <li>The circumstance consider'd, good my lord,</li>
  <li>Whate'er Lord Harry Percy then had said</li>
  <li>To such a person and in such a place,</li>
  <li>At such a time, with all the rest retold,</li>
  <li class="number">May reasonably die and never rise</li>
  <li>To do him wrong or any way impeach</li>
  <li>What then he said, so he unsay it now.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY IV</li>
  <li>Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,</li>
  <li>But with proviso and exception,</li>
  <li class="number">That we at our own charge shall ransom straight</li>
  <li>His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer;</li>
  <li>Who, on my soul, hath wilfully betray'd</li>
  <li>The lives of those that he did lead to fight</li>
  <li>Against that great magician, damn'd Glendower,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March</li>
  <li>Hath lately married. Shall our coffers, then,</li>
  <li>Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?</li>
  <li>Shall we but treason? and indent with fears,</li>
  <li>When they have lost and forfeited themselves?</li>
  <li class="number">No, on the barren mountains let him starve;</li>
  <li>For I shall never hold that man my friend</li>
  <li>Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost</li>
  <li>To ransom home revolted Mortimer.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HOTSPUR</li>
  <li>Revolted Mortimer!</li>
  <li class="number">He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,</li>
  <li>But by the chance of war; to prove that true</li>
  <li>Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,</li>
  <li>Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took</li>
  <li>When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,</li>
  <li class="number">In single opposition, hand to hand,</li>
  <li>He did confound the best part of an hour</li>
  <li>In changing hardiment with great Glendower:</li>
  <li>Three times they breathed and three times did</li>
  <li>they drink,</li>
  <li class="number">Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;</li>
  <li>Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,</li>
  <li>Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,</li>
  <li>And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,</li>
  <li>Bloodstained with these valiant combatants.</li>
  <li class="number">Never did base and rotten policy</li>
  <li>Colour her working with such deadly wounds;</li>
  <li>Nor could the noble Mortimer</li>
  <li>Receive so many, and all willingly:</li>
  <li>Then let not him be slander'd with revolt.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY IV</li>
  <li class="number">Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him;</li>
  <li>He never did encounter with Glendower:</li>
  <li>I tell thee,</li>
  <li>He durst as well have met the devil alone</li>
  <li>As Owen Glendower for an enemy.</li>
  <li class="number">Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth</li>

  <li>Or you shall hear in such a kind from me</li>
  <li>As will displease you. My Lord Northumberland,</li>
  <li class="number">We licence your departure with your son.</li>

  <li>Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,</li>

  <li>As high in the air as this unthankful king,</li>

  <li class="speaker">EARL OF WORCESTER</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</li>
  <li class="number">He was; I heard the proclamation:</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</li>

  <li>Good morrow, Master Gadshill. It holds current that</li>

  <li>him in gold: I heard him tell it to one of his</li>

  <li>strike sooner than speak, and speak sooner than</li>
  <li class="number">drink, and drink sooner than pray: and yet, zounds,</li>
  <li>I lie; for they pray continually to their saint, the</li>

  <li>Ned, prithee, come out of that fat room, and lend me</li>
  <li>thy hand to laugh a little.</li>

  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>With three or four loggerheads amongst three or four</li>
  <li class="number">score hogsheads. I have sounded the very</li>
  <li>base-string of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother</li>
  <li>to a leash of drawers; and can call them all by</li>
  <li>their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis.</li>
  <li>They take it already upon their salvation, that</li>
  <li class="number">though I be but the prince of Wales, yet I am king</li>
  <li>of courtesy; and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack,</li>
  <li>like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a</li>
  <li>good boy, by the Lord, so they call me, and when I</li>
  <li>am king of England, I shall command all the good</li>
  <li class="number">lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dyeing</li>
  <li>scarlet; and when you breathe in your watering, they</li>
  <li>cry  'hem!' and bid you play it off. To conclude, I</li>
  <li>am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour,</li>
  <li>that I can drink with any tinker in his own language</li>
  <li class="number">during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost</li>
  <li>much honour, that thou wert not with me in this sweet</li>
  <li>action. But, sweet Ned —  to sweeten which name of</li>
  <li>Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapped</li>
  <li>even now into my hand by an under-skinker, one that</li>
  <li class="number">never spake other English in his life than 'Eight</li>
  <li>shillings and sixpence' and 'You are welcome,' with</li>
  <li>this shrill addition, 'Anon, anon, sir! Score a pint</li>
  <li>of bastard in the Half-Moon,' or so. But, Ned, to</li>
  <li>drive away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee,</li>
  <li class="number">do thou stand in some by-room, while I question my</li>
  <li>puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar; and do</li>
  <li>thou never leave calling 'Francis,' that his tale</li>

  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>

  <li>away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roared</li>
  <li>for mercy and still run and roared, as ever I heard</li>

  <li>Yes, Jack, upon instinct.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li class="number">I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there too,</li>

  <li>For God's sake, lords, convey my tristful queen;</li>
  <li>For tears do stop the flood-gates of her eyes.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Hostess</li>
  <li>O Jesu, he doth it as like one of these harlotry</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li class="number">Peace, good pint-pot; peace, good tickle-brain.</li>
  <li>Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy</li>
  <li>time, but also how thou art accompanied: for though</li>
  <li>the camomile, the more it is trodden on the faster</li>
  <li>it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted the</li>
  <li class="number">sooner it wears. That thou art my son, I have</li>
  <li>partly thy mother's word, partly my own opinion,</li>
  <li>but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a</li>
  <li>foolish-hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant</li>
  <li>me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point;</li>
  <li class="number">why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall</li>
  <li>the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat</li>
  <li>blackberries? a question not to be asked. Shall</li>
  <li>the sun of England prove a thief and take purses? a</li>
  <li>question to be asked. There is a thing, Harry,</li>
  <li class="number">which thou hast often heard of and it is known to</li>
  <li>many in our land by the name of pitch: this pitch,</li>
  <li>as ancient writers do report, doth defile; so doth</li>
  <li>the company thou keepest: for, Harry, now I do not</li>
  <li>speak to thee in drink but in tears, not in</li>
  <li class="number">pleasure but in passion, not in words only, but in</li>
  <li>woes also: and yet there is a virtuous man whom I</li>
  <li>have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>What manner of man, an it like your majesty?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>A goodly portly man, i' faith, and a corpulent; of a</li>
  <li class="number">cheerful look, a pleasing eye and a most noble</li>
  <li>carriage; and, as I think, his age some fifty, or,</li>
  <li>by'r lady, inclining to three score; and now I</li>
  <li>remember me, his name is Falstaff: if that man</li>
  <li>should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me; for, Harry,</li>
  <li class="number">I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be</li>
  <li>known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then,</li>
  <li>peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that</li>
  <li>Falstaff: him keep with, the rest banish. And tell</li>
  <li>me now, thou naughty varlet, tell me, where hast</li>
  <li class="number">thou been this month?</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>Well, here I am set.</li>

  <li>of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed</li>
  <li class="number">cloak-bag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with</li>
  <li>the pudding in his belly, that reverend vice, that</li>
  <li>grey iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity in</li>
  <li>years? Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and</li>
  <li>drink it? wherein neat and cleanly, but to carve a</li>
  <li class="number">capon and eat it? wherein cunning, but in craft?</li>
  <li>wherein crafty, but in villany? wherein villanous,</li>
  <li>but in all things? wherein worthy, but in nothing?</li>

  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>Dost thou hear, Hal? never call a true piece of</li>

<h3>SCENE I.  Bangor. The Archdeacon's house.</h3>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, MORTIMER, and GLENDOWER</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MORTIMER</li>
  <li>These promises are fair, the parties sure,</li>
  <li>And our induction full of prosperous hope.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HOTSPUR</li>
  <li>Lord Mortimer, and cousin Glendower,</li>
  <li>Will you sit down?</li>
  <li class="number">And uncle Worcester: a plague upon it!</li>
  <li>I have forgot the map.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLENDOWER</li>
  <li>No, here it is.</li>
  <li>Sit, cousin Percy; sit, good cousin Hotspur,</li>
  <li>For by that name as oft as Lancaster</li>
  <li class="number">Doth speak of you, his cheek looks pale and with</li>
  <li>A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HOTSPUR</li>
  <li>And you in hell, as oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLENDOWER</li>
  <li>I cannot blame him: at my nativity</li>
  <li>The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,</li>
  <li class="number">Of burning cressets; and at my birth</li>
  <li>The frame and huge foundation of the earth</li>
  <li>Shaked like a coward.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HOTSPUR</li>
  <li>Why, so it would have done at the same season, if</li>
  <li>your mother's cat had but kittened, though yourself</li>
  <li class="number">had never been born.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLENDOWER</li>
  <li>I say the earth did shake when I was born.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HOTSPUR</li>
  <li>And I say the earth was not of my mind,</li>
  <li>If you suppose as fearing you it shook.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLENDOWER</li>
  <li>The heavens were all on fire, the earth did tremble.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HOTSPUR</li>
  <li class="number">O, then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire,</li>
  <li>And not in fear of your nativity.</li>
  <li>Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth</li>
  <li>In strange eruptions; oft the teeming earth</li>
  <li>Is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd</li>
  <li class="number">By the imprisoning of unruly wind</li>
  <li>Within her womb; which, for enlargement striving,</li>
  <li>Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down</li>
  <li>Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth</li>
  <li>Our grandam earth, having this distemperature,</li>
  <li class="number">In passion shook.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLENDOWER</li>
  <li>Cousin, of many men</li>
  <li>I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave</li>
  <li>To tell you once again that at my birth</li>
  <li>The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,</li>
  <li class="number">The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds</li>
  <li>Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields.</li>
  <li>These signs have mark'd me extraordinary;</li>
  <li>And all the courses of my life do show</li>
  <li>I am not in the roll of common men.</li>
  <li class="number">Where is he living, clipp'd in with the sea</li>
  <li>That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,</li>
  <li>Which calls me pupil, or hath read to me?</li>
  <li>And bring him out that is but woman's son</li>
  <li>Can trace me in the tedious ways of art</li>
  <li class="number">And hold me pace in deep experiments.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HOTSPUR</li>
  <li>I think there's no man speaks better Welsh.</li>
  <li>I'll to dinner.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MORTIMER</li>
  <li>Peace, cousin Percy; you will make him mad.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLENDOWER</li>
  <li>I can call spirits from the vasty deep.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HOTSPUR</li>
  <li class="number">Why, so can I, or so can any man;</li>
  <li>But will they come when you do call for them?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLENDOWER</li>
  <li>Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command</li>
  <li>The devil.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HOTSPUR</li>
  <li>And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil</li>
  <li class="number">By telling truth: tell truth and shame the devil.</li>
  <li>If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,</li>
  <li>And I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence.</li>
  <li>O, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MORTIMER</li>
  <li>Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLENDOWER</li>
  <li class="number">Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head</li>
  <li>Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye</li>
  <li>And sandy-bottom'd Severn have I sent him</li>
  <li>Bootless home and weather-beaten back.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HOTSPUR</li>
  <li>Home without boots, and in foul weather too!</li>
  <li class="number">How 'scapes he agues, in the devil's name?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLENDOWER</li>
  <li>Come, here's the map: shall we divide our right</li>
  <li>According to our threefold order ta'en?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MORTIMER</li>
  <li>The archdeacon hath divided it</li>
  <li>Into three limits very equally:</li>
  <li class="number">England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,</li>
  <li>By south and east is to my part assign'd:</li>
  <li>All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore,</li>
  <li>And all the fertile land within that bound,</li>
  <li>To Owen Glendower: and, dear coz, to you</li>
  <li class="number">The remnant northward, lying off from Trent.</li>
  <li>And our indentures tripartite are drawn;</li>
  <li>Which being sealed interchangeably,</li>
  <li>A business that this night may execute,</li>
  <li>To-morrow, cousin Percy, you and I</li>
  <li class="number">And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth</li>
  <li>To meet your father and the Scottish power,</li>
  <li>As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury.</li>
  <li>My father Glendower is not ready yet,</li>
  <li>Not shall we need his help these fourteen days.</li>
  <li class="number">Within that space you may have drawn together</li>
  <li>Your tenants, friends and neighbouring gentlemen.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLENDOWER</li>
  <li>A shorter time shall send me to you, lords:</li>
  <li>And in my conduct shall your ladies come;</li>
  <li>From whom you now must steal and take no leave,</li>
  <li class="number">For there will be a world of water shed</li>
  <li>Upon the parting of your wives and you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HOTSPUR</li>
  <li>Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here,</li>
  <li>In quantity equals not one of yours:</li>
  <li>See how this river comes me cranking in,</li>
  <li class="number">And cuts me from the best of all my land</li>
  <li>A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.</li>
  <li>I'll have the current in this place damm'd up;</li>
  <li>And here the smug and silver Trent shall run</li>
  <li>In a new channel, fair and evenly;</li>
  <li class="number">It shall not wind with such a deep indent,</li>
  <li>To rob me of so rich a bottom here.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLENDOWER</li>
  <li>Not wind? it shall, it must; you see it doth.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MORTIMER</li>
  <li>Yea, but</li>
  <li>Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up</li>
  <li class="number">With like advantage on the other side;</li>
  <li>Gelding the opposed continent as much</li>
  <li>As on the other side it takes from you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EARL OF WORCESTER</li>
  <li>Yea, but a little charge will trench him here</li>
  <li>And on this north side win this cape of land;</li>
  <li class="number">And then he runs straight and even.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HOTSPUR</li>
  <li>I'll have it so: a little charge will do it.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLENDOWER</li>
  <li>I'll not have it alter'd.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HOTSPUR</li>
  <li>Will not you?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLENDOWER</li>
  <li>No, nor you shall not.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HOTSPUR</li>
  <li class="number">Who shall say me nay?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLENDOWER</li>
  <li>Why, that will I.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HOTSPUR</li>
  <li>Let me not understand you, then; speak it in Welsh.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLENDOWER</li>
  <li>I can speak English, lord, as well as you;</li>
  <li>For I was train'd up in the English court;</li>
  <li class="number">Where, being but young, I framed to the harp</li>
  <li>Many an English ditty lovely well</li>
  <li>And gave the tongue a helpful ornament,</li>
  <li>A virtue that was never seen in you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HOTSPUR</li>
  <li>Marry,</li>
  <li class="number">And I am glad of it with all my heart:</li>
  <li>I had rather be a kitten and cry mew</li>
  <li>Than one of these same metre ballad-mongers;</li>
  <li>I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd,</li>
  <li>Or a dry wheel grate on the axle-tree;</li>
  <li class="number">And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,</li>
  <li>Nothing so much as mincing poetry:</li>
  <li>'Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLENDOWER</li>
  <li>Come, you shall have Trent turn'd.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HOTSPUR</li>
  <li>I do not care: I'll give thrice so much land</li>
  <li class="number">To any well-deserving friend;</li>
  <li>But in the way of bargain, mark ye me,</li>
  <li>I'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair.</li>
  <li>Are the indentures drawn? shall we be gone?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">GLENDOWER</li>
  <li>The moon shines fair; you may away by night:</li>
  <li class="number">I'll haste the writer and withal</li>
  <li>Break with your wives of your departure hence:</li>
  <li>I am afraid my daughter will run mad,</li>
  <li>So much she doteth on her Mortimer.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">Exit GLENDOWER</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MORTIMER</li>
  <li>Fie, cousin Percy! how you cross my father!</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HOTSPUR</li>
  <li class="number">I cannot choose: sometime he angers me</li>
  <li>With telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant,</li>
  <li>Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies,</li>
  <li>And of a dragon and a finless fish,</li>
  <li>A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven,</li>
  <li class="number">A couching lion and a ramping cat,</li>
  <li>And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff</li>
  <li>As puts me from my faith. I tell you what;</li>
  <li>He held me last night at least nine hours</li>
  <li>In reckoning up the several devils' names</li>
  <li class="number">That were his lackeys: I cried 'hum,' and 'well, go to,'</li>
  <li>But mark'd him not a word. O, he is as tedious</li>
  <li>As a tired horse, a railing wife;</li>
  <li>Worse than a smoky house: I had rather live</li>
  <li>With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far,</li>
  <li class="number">Than feed on cates and have him talk to me</li>
  <li>In any summer-house in Christendom.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">MORTIMER</li>
  <li>In faith, he is a worthy gentleman,</li>
  <li>Exceedingly well read, and profited</li>
  <li>In strange concealments, valiant as a lion</li>
  <li class="number">And as wondrous affable and as bountiful</li>
  <li>As mines of India. Shall I tell you, cousin?</li>
  <li>He holds your temper in a high respect</li>
  <li>And curbs himself even of his natural scope</li>
  <li>When you come 'cross his humour; faith, he does:</li>
  <li class="number">I warrant you, that man is not alive</li>
  <li>Might so have tempted him as you have done,</li>
  <li>Without the taste of danger and reproof:</li>
  <li>But do not use it oft, let me entreat you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EARL OF WORCESTER</li>
  <li>In faith, my lord, you are too wilful-blame;</li>
  <li class="number">And since your coming hither have done enough</li>
  <li>To put him quite beside his patience.</li>
  <li>You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault:</li>
  <li>Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood —  </li>
  <li>And that's the dearest grace it renders you —  </li>
  <li class="number">Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,</li>
  <li>Defect of manners, want of government,</li>
  <li>Pride, haughtiness, opinion and disdain:</li>
  <li>The least of which haunting a nobleman</li>
  <li>Loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain</li>
  <li class="number">Upon the beauty of all parts besides,</li>
  <li>Beguiling them of commendation.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HOTSPUR</li>
  <li>Well, I am school'd: good manners be your speed!</li>
  <li>Here come our wives, and let us take our leave.</li>

  <li>I understand thy kisses and thou mine,</li>

<div class="stage-direction">Enter KING HENRY IV, PRINCE HENRY, and others</div>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY IV</li>
  <li>Lords, give us leave; the Prince of Wales and I</li>
  <li>Must have some private conference; but be near at hand,</li>
  <li>For we shall presently have need of you.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Exeunt Lords</li>
  <li>I know not whether God will have it so,</li>
  <li class="number">For some displeasing service I have done,</li>
  <li>That, in his secret doom, out of my blood</li>
  <li>He'll breed revengement and a scourge for me;</li>
  <li>But thou dost in thy passages of life</li>
  <li>Make me believe that thou art only mark'd</li>
  <li class="number">For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven</li>
  <li>To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else,</li>
  <li>Could such inordinate and low desires,</li>
  <li>Such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts,</li>
  <li>Such barren pleasures, rude society,</li>
  <li class="number">As thou art match'd withal and grafted to,</li>
  <li>Accompany the greatness of thy blood</li>
  <li>And hold their level with thy princely heart?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>So please your majesty, I would I could</li>
  <li>Quit all offences with as clear excuse</li>
  <li class="number">As well as I am doubtless I can purge</li>
  <li>Myself of many I am charged withal:</li>
  <li>Yet such extenuation let me beg,</li>
  <li>As, in reproof of many tales devised,</li>
  <li>which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear,</li>
  <li class="number">By smiling pick-thanks and base news-mongers,</li>
  <li>I may, for some things true, wherein my youth</li>
  <li>Hath faulty wander'd and irregular,</li>
  <li>Find pardon on my true submission.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">KING HENRY IV</li>
  <li>God pardon thee! yet let me wonder, Harry,</li>
  <li class="number">At thy affections, which do hold a wing</li>
  <li>Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.</li>
  <li>Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost.</li>
  <li>Which by thy younger brother is supplied,</li>
  <li>And art almost an alien to the hearts</li>
  <li class="number">Of all the court and princes of my blood:</li>
  <li>The hope and expectation of thy time</li>
  <li>Is ruin'd, and the soul of every man</li>
  <li>Prophetically doth forethink thy fall.</li>
  <li>Had I so lavish of my presence been,</li>
  <li class="number">So common-hackney'd in the eyes of men,</li>
  <li>So stale and cheap to vulgar company,</li>
  <li>Opinion, that did help me to the crown,</li>
  <li>Had still kept loyal to possession</li>
  <li>And left me in reputeless banishment,</li>
  <li class="number">A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.</li>
  <li>By being seldom seen, I could not stir</li>
  <li>But like a comet I was wonder'd at;</li>
  <li>That men would tell their children 'This is he;'</li>
  <li>Others would say 'Where, which is Bolingbroke?'</li>
  <li class="number">And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,</li>
  <li>And dress'd myself in such humility</li>
  <li>That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,</li>
  <li>Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,</li>
  <li>Even in the presence of the crowned king.</li>
  <li class="number">Thus did I keep my person fresh and new;</li>
  <li>My presence, like a robe pontifical,</li>
  <li>Ne'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state,</li>
  <li>Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast</li>
  <li>And won by rareness such solemnity.</li>
  <li class="number">The skipping king, he ambled up and down</li>
  <li>With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,</li>
  <li>Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,</li>
  <li>Mingled his royalty with capering fools,</li>
  <li>Had his great name profaned with their scorns</li>
  <li class="number">And gave his countenance, against his name,</li>
  <li>To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push</li>
  <li>Of every beardless vain comparative,</li>
  <li>Grew a companion to the common streets,</li>
  <li>Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;</li>
  <li class="number">That, being daily swallow'd by men's eyes,</li>
  <li>They surfeited with honey and began</li>
  <li>To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little</li>
  <li>More than a little is by much too much.</li>
  <li>So when he had occasion to be seen,</li>
  <li class="number">He was but as the cuckoo is in June,</li>
  <li>Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes</li>
  <li>As, sick and blunted with community,</li>
  <li>Afford no extraordinary gaze,</li>
  <li>Such as is bent on sun-like majesty</li>
  <li class="number">When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;</li>
  <li>But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down,</li>
  <li>Slept in his face and render'd such aspect</li>
  <li>As cloudy men use to their adversaries,</li>
  <li>Being with his presence glutted, gorged and full.</li>
  <li class="number">And in that very line, Harry, standest thou;</li>
  <li>For thou has lost thy princely privilege</li>
  <li>With vile participation: not an eye</li>
  <li>But is a-weary of thy common sight,</li>
  <li>Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more;</li>
  <li class="number">Which now doth that I would not have it do,</li>
  <li>Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>

  <li>He hath more worthy interest to the state</li>
  <li class="number">Than thou the shadow of succession;</li>
  <li>For of no right, nor colour like to right,</li>
  <li>He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,</li>
  <li>Turns head against the lion's armed jaws,</li>
  <li>And, being no more in debt to years than thou,</li>
  <li class="number">Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on</li>
  <li>To bloody battles and to bruising arms.</li>
  <li>What never-dying honour hath he got</li>
  <li>Against renowned Douglas! whose high deeds,</li>
  <li>Whose hot incursions and great name in arms</li>
  <li class="number">Holds from all soldiers chief majority</li>
  <li>And military title capital</li>
  <li>Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ:</li>
  <li>Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,</li>
  <li>This infant warrior, in his enterprises</li>
  <li class="number">Discomfited great Douglas, ta'en him once,</li>
  <li>Enlarged him and made a friend of him,</li>
  <li>To fill the mouth of deep defiance up</li>
  <li>And shake the peace and safety of our throne.</li>
  <li>And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,</li>
  <li class="number">The Archbishop's grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer,</li>
  <li>Capitulate against us and are up.</li>
  <li>But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?</li>
  <li>Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,</li>
  <li>Which art my near'st and dearest enemy?</li>
  <li class="number">Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,</li>
  <li>Base inclination and the start of spleen</li>
  <li>To fight against me under Percy's pay,</li>
  <li>To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,</li>
  <li>To show how much thou art degenerate.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>

  <li>And God forgive them that so much have sway'd</li>
  <li>Your majesty's good thoughts away from me!</li>
  <li>I will redeem all this on Percy's head</li>
  <li>And in the closing of some glorious day</li>
  <li class="number">Be bold to tell you that I am your son;</li>
  <li>When I will wear a garment all of blood</li>

  <li class="number">My shames redoubled! for the time will come,</li>
  <li>That I shall make this northern youth exchange</li>
  <li>His glorious deeds for my indignities.</li>
  <li>Percy is but my factor, good my lord,</li>
  <li>To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf;</li>
  <li class="number">And I will call him to so strict account,</li>
  <li>That he shall render every glory up,</li>
  <li>Yea, even the slightest worship of his time,</li>
  <li>Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart.</li>
  <li>This, in the name of God, I promise here:</li>
  <li class="number">The which if He be pleased I shall perform,</li>
  <li>I do beseech your majesty may salve</li>
  <li>The long-grown wounds of my intemperance:</li>
  <li>If not, the end of life cancels all bands;</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>Why, Hal, thou knowest, as thou art but man, I dare:</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy</li>
  <li>knees! But, sirrah, there's no room for faith,</li>
  <li>truth, nor honesty in this bosom of thine; it is all</li>
  <li>filled up with guts and midriff. Charge an honest</li>
  <li class="number">woman with picking thy pocket! why, thou whoreson,</li>
  <li>impudent, embossed rascal, if there were anything in</li>
  <li>thy pocket but tavern-reckonings, memorandums of</li>
  <li>bawdy-houses, and one poor penny-worth of</li>
  <li>sugar-candy to make thee long-winded, if thy pocket</li>
  <li class="number">were enriched with any other injuries but these, I</li>
  <li>am a villain: and yet you will stand to if; you will</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>Dost thou hear, Hal? thou knowest in the state of</li>

  <li class="number">Falstaff do in the days of villany? Thou seest I</li>
  <li>have more flesh than another man, and therefore more</li>
  <li>frailty. You confess then, you picked my pocket?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>It appears so by the story.</li>

  <li class="speaker">EARL OF DOUGLAS</li>

  <li>Do so, and 'tis well.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Enter a Messenger with letters</li>
  <li>What letters hast thou there? — I can but thank you.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Messenger</li>
  <li class="number">These letters come from your father.</li>

<ol class="speech">

  <li>Letters from him! why comes he not himself?</li>

  <li>He cannot come, my lord; he is grievous sick.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HOTSPUR</li>
  <li>'Zounds! how has he the leisure to be sick</li>
  <li>In such a rustling time? Who leads his power?</li>

  <li>I prithee, tell me, doth he keep his bed?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">Messenger</li>
  <li>He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth;</li>
  <li>And at the time of my departure thence</li>
  <li class="number">He was much fear'd by his physicians.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">

  <li>I would the state of time had first been whole</li>

  <li class="speaker">HOTSPUR</li>
  <li>Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth infect</li>
  <li class="number">The very life-blood of our enterprise;</li>
  <li>'Tis catching hither, even to our camp.</li>
  <li>He writes me here, that inward sickness — </li>
  <li>And that his friends by deputation could not</li>
  <li>So soon be drawn, nor did he think it meet</li>
  <li class="number">To lay so dangerous and dear a trust</li>
  <li>On any soul removed but on his own.</li>
  <li>Yet doth he give us bold advertisement,</li>
  <li>That with our small conjunction we should on,</li>
  <li>To see how fortune is disposed to us;</li>
  <li class="number">For, as he writes, there is no quailing now.</li>
  <li>Because the king is certainly possess'd</li>
  <li>Of all our purposes. What say you to it?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EARL OF WORCESTER</li>
  <li>Your father's sickness is a maim to us.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HOTSPUR</li>
  <li>A perilous gash, a very limb lopp'd off:</li>
  <li class="number">And yet, in faith, it is not; his present want</li>
  <li>Seems more than we shall find it: were it good</li>
  <li>To set the exact wealth of all our states</li>
  <li>All at one cast? to set so rich a main</li>
  <li>On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?</li>
  <li class="number">It were not good; for therein should we read</li>
  <li>The very bottom and the soul of hope,</li>
  <li>The very list, the very utmost bound</li>
  <li>Of all our fortunes.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EARL OF DOUGLAS</li>
  <li>'Faith, and so we should;</li>
  <li class="number">Where now remains a sweet reversion:</li>
  <li>We may boldly spend upon the hope of what</li>
  <li>Is to come in:</li>
  <li>A comfort of retirement lives in this.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HOTSPUR</li>
  <li>A rendezvous, a home to fly unto.</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EARL OF WORCESTER</li>
  <li>But yet I would your father had been here.</li>
  <li>The quality and hair of our attempt</li>
  <li>Brooks no division: it will be thought</li>
  <li class="number">By some, that know not why he is away,</li>
  <li>That wisdom, loyalty and mere dislike</li>
  <li>Of our proceedings kept the earl from hence:</li>
  <li>And think how such an apprehension</li>
  <li>May turn the tide of fearful faction</li>
  <li class="number">And breed a kind of question in our cause;</li>
  <li>For well you know we of the offering side</li>
  <li>Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement,</li>
  <li>And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence</li>
  <li>The eye of reason may pry in upon us:</li>
  <li class="number">This absence of your father's draws a curtain,</li>
  <li>That shows the ignorant a kind of fear</li>
  <li>Before not dreamt of.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HOTSPUR</li>
  <li>You strain too far.</li>
  <li>I rather of his absence make this use:</li>
  <li class="number">It lends a lustre and more great opinion,</li>
  <li>A larger dare to our great enterprise,</li>
  <li>Than if the earl were here; for men must think,</li>
  <li>If we without his help can make a head</li>
  <li>To push against a kingdom, with his help</li>
  <li class="number">We shall o'erturn it topsy-turvy down.</li>
  <li>Yet all goes well, yet all our joints are whole.</li>

  <li class="number">All hot and bleeding will we offer them:</li>

  <li>I have got, in exchange of a hundred and fifty</li>
  <li>soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I press me</li>
  <li class="number">none but good house-holders, yeoman's sons; inquire</li>
  <li>me out contracted bachelors, such as had been asked</li>
  <li>twice on the banns; such a commodity of warm slaves,</li>
  <li>as had as lieve hear the devil as a drum; such as</li>
  <li>fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck</li>
  <li class="number">fowl or a hurt wild-duck. I pressed me none but such</li>
  <li>toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no</li>
  <li>bigger than pins' heads, and they have bought out</li>
  <li>their services; and now my whole charge consists of</li>
  <li>ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of</li>
  <li class="number">companies, slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the</li>

  <li>What, Hal! how now, mad wag! what a devil dost thou</li>
  <li>in Warwickshire? My good Lord of Westmoreland, I</li>

  <li>at Shrewsbury.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</li>
  <li class="number">Faith, Sir John,'tis more than time that I were</li>
  <li>there, and you too; but my powers are there already.</li>
  <li>The king, I can tell you, looks for us all: we must</li>
  <li>away all night.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>Tut, never fear me: I am as vigilant as a cat to</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>I think, to steal cream indeed, for thy theft hath</li>

  <li>Tut, tut; good enough to toss; food for powder, food</li>
  <li>for powder; they'll fill a pit as well as better:</li>
  <li>tush, man, mortal men, mortal men.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</li>
  <li>Ay, but, Sir John, methinks they are exceeding poor</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>'Faith, for their poverty, I know not where they had</li>

  <li>Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt; and would to God</li>
  <li>You were of our determination!</li>
  <li class="number">Some of us love you well; and even those some</li>

  <li>And God defend but still I should stand so,</li>
  <li class="number">So long as out of limit and true rule</li>
  <li>You stand against anointed majesty.</li>
  <li>But to my charge. The king hath sent to know</li>
  <li>The nature of your griefs, and whereupon</li>
  <li>You conjure from the breast of civil peace</li>
  <li class="number">Such bold hostility, teaching his duteous land</li>
  <li>Audacious cruelty. If that the king</li>
  <li>Have any way your good deserts forgot,</li>
  <li>Which he confesseth to be manifold,</li>
  <li>He bids you name your griefs; and with all speed</li>
  <li class="number">You shall have your desires with interest</li>
  <li>And pardon absolute for yourself and these</li>
  <li>Herein misled by your suggestion.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HOTSPUR</li>
  <li>The king is kind; and well we know the king</li>
  <li>Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.</li>
  <li class="number">My father and my uncle and myself</li>
  <li>Did give him that same royalty he wears;</li>
  <li>And when he was not six and twenty strong,</li>
  <li>Sick in the world's regard, wretched and low,</li>
  <li>A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,</li>
  <li class="number">My father gave him welcome to the shore;</li>
  <li>And when he heard him swear and vow to God</li>
  <li>He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,</li>
  <li>To sue his livery and beg his peace,</li>
  <li>With tears of innocency and terms of zeal,</li>
  <li class="number">My father, in kind heart and pity moved,</li>
  <li>Swore him assistance and perform'd it too.</li>
  <li>Now when the lords and barons of the realm</li>
  <li>Perceived Northumberland did lean to him,</li>
  <li>The more and less came in with cap and knee;</li>
  <li class="number">Met him in boroughs, cities, villages,</li>
  <li>Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,</li>
  <li>Laid gifts before him, proffer'd him their oaths,</li>
  <li>Gave him their heirs, as pages follow'd him</li>
  <li>Even at the heels in golden multitudes.</li>
  <li class="number">He presently, as greatness knows itself,</li>
  <li>Steps me a little higher than his vow</li>
  <li>Made to my father, while his blood was poor,</li>
  <li>Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh;</li>
  <li>And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform</li>
  <li class="number">Some certain edicts and some strait decrees</li>
  <li>That lie too heavy on the commonwealth,</li>
  <li>Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep</li>
  <li>Over his country's wrongs; and by this face,</li>
  <li>This seeming brow of justice, did he win</li>
  <li class="number">The hearts of all that he did angle for;</li>
  <li>Proceeded further; cut me off the heads</li>
  <li>Of all the favourites that the absent king</li>
  <li>In deputation left behind him here,</li>
  <li>When he was personal in the Irish war.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SIR WALTER BLUNT</li>
  <li class="number">Tut, I came not to hear this.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HOTSPUR</li>
  <li>Then to the point.</li>
  <li>In short time after, he deposed the king;</li>
  <li>Soon after that, deprived him of his life;</li>
  <li>And in the neck of that, task'd the whole state:</li>
  <li class="number">To make that worse, suffer'd his kinsman March,</li>
  <li>Who is, if every owner were well placed,</li>
  <li>Indeed his king, to be engaged in Wales,</li>
  <li>There without ransom to lie forfeited;</li>
  <li>Disgraced me in my happy victories,</li>
  <li class="number">Sought to entrap me by intelligence;</li>
  <li>Rated mine uncle from the council-board;</li>
  <li>In rage dismiss'd my father from the court;</li>
  <li>Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong,</li>
  <li>And in conclusion drove us to seek out</li>
  <li class="number">This head of safety; and withal to pry</li>
  <li>Into his title, the which we find</li>
  <li>Too indirect for long continuance.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SIR WALTER BLUNT</li>
  <li>Shall I return this answer to the king?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">HOTSPUR</li>
  <li>Not so, Sir Walter: we'll withdraw awhile.</li>
  <li class="number">Go to the king; and let there be impawn'd</li>
  <li>Some surety for a safe return again,</li>
  <li>And in the morning early shall my uncle</li>
  <li>Bring him our purposes: and so farewell.</li>

  <li>My good lord,</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</li>
  <li>Like enough you do.</li>
  <li>To-morrow, good Sir Michael, is a day</li>
  <li class="number">Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men</li>
  <li>Must bide the touch; for, sir, at Shrewsbury,</li>
  <li>As I am truly given to understand,</li>
  <li>The king with mighty and quick-raised power</li>
  <li>Meets with Lord Harry: and, I fear, Sir Michael,</li>
  <li class="number">What with the sickness of Northumberland,</li>
  <li>Whose power was in the first proportion,</li>
  <li>And what with Owen Glendower's absence thence,</li>
  <li>Who with them was a rated sinew too</li>
  <li>And comes not in, o'er-ruled by prophecies,</li>
  <li class="number">I fear the power of Percy is too weak</li>
  <li>To wage an instant trial with the king.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">SIR MICHAEL</li>
  <li>Why, my good lord, you need not fear;</li>
  <li>There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer.</li>

  <li>No, Mortimer is not there.</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</li>
  <li>And so there is: but yet the king hath drawn</li>

  <li class="number">How now, my Lord of Worcester! 'tis not well</li>
  <li>That you and I should meet upon such terms</li>
  <li>As now we meet. You have deceived our trust,</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">EARL OF WORCESTER</li>
  <li>It pleased your majesty to turn your looks</li>

  <li>And yet I must remember you, my lord,</li>
  <li>We were the first and dearest of your friends.</li>

  <li>When yet you were in place and in account</li>
  <li>Nothing so strong and fortunate as I.</li>
  <li class="number">It was myself, my brother and his son,</li>
  <li>That brought you home and boldly did outdare</li>
  <li>The dangers of the time. You swore to us,</li>
  <li>And you did swear that oath at Doncaster,</li>
  <li>That you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state;</li>
  <li class="number">Nor claim no further than your new-fall'n right,</li>
  <li>The seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster:</li>
  <li>To this we swore our aid. But in short space</li>
  <li>It rain'd down fortune showering on your head;</li>
  <li>And such a flood of greatness fell on you,</li>
  <li class="number">What with our help, what with the absent king,</li>
  <li>What with the injuries of a wanton time,</li>
  <li>The seeming sufferances that you had borne,</li>
  <li>And the contrarious winds that held the king</li>
  <li>So long in his unlucky Irish wars</li>
  <li class="number">That all in England did repute him dead:</li>
  <li>And from this swarm of fair advantages</li>
  <li>You took occasion to be quickly woo'd</li>
  <li>To gripe the general sway into your hand;</li>
  <li>Forget your oath to us at Doncaster;</li>
  <li class="number">And being fed by us you used us so</li>
  <li>As that ungentle hull, the cuckoo's bird,</li>
  <li>Useth the sparrow; did oppress our nest;</li>
  <li>Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk</li>
  <li>That even our love durst not come near your sight</li>
  <li class="number">For fear of swallowing; but with nimble wing</li>
  <li>We were enforced, for safety sake, to fly</li>
  <li>Out of sight and raise this present head;</li>
  <li>Whereby we stand opposed by such means</li>
  <li>As you yourself have forged against yourself</li>
  <li class="number">By unkind usage, dangerous countenance,</li>

  <li>Sworn to us in your younger enterprise.</li>

  <li>With some fine colour that may please the eye</li>
  <li>Of fickle changelings and poor discontents,</li>
  <li>Which gape and rub the elbow at the news</li>
  <li>Of hurlyburly innovation:</li>
  <li class="number">And never yet did insurrection want</li>

  <li>In praise of Henry Percy: by my hopes,</li>
  <li>This present enterprise set off his head,</li>
  <li class="number">I do not think a braver gentleman,</li>
  <li>More active-valiant or more valiant-young,</li>
  <li>More daring or more bold, is now alive</li>

  <li>For my part, I may speak it to my shame,</li>
  <li class="number">I have a truant been to chivalry;</li>
  <li>And so I hear he doth account me too;</li>
  <li>Yet this before my father's majesty — </li>

  <li>Rising up  Embowelled! if thou embowel me to-day,</li>
  <li>I'll give you leave to powder me and eat me too</li>
  <li class="number">to-morrow. 'Sblood,'twas time to counterfeit, or</li>
  <li>that hot termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot too.</li>
  <li>Counterfeit? I lie, I am no counterfeit: to die,</li>
  <li>is to be a counterfeit; for he is but the</li>
  <li>counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man:</li>
  <li class="number">but to counterfeit dying, when a man thereby</li>
  <li>liveth, is to be no counterfeit, but the true and</li>
  <li>perfect image of life indeed. The better part of</li>
  <li>valour is discretion; in the which better part I</li>
  <li>have saved my life.'Zounds, I am afraid of this</li>
  <li class="number">gunpowder Percy, though he be dead: how, if he</li>
  <li>should counterfeit too and rise? by my faith, I am</li>
  <li>afraid he would prove the better counterfeit.</li>
  <li>Therefore I'll make him sure; yea, and I'll swear I</li>
  <li>killed him. Why may not he rise as well as I?</li>
  <li class="number">Nothing confutes me but eyes, and nobody sees me.</li>

  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>Come, brother John; full bravely hast thou flesh'd</li>

</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">LANCASTER</li>
  <li class="number">But, soft! whom have we here?</li>
  <li>Did you not tell me this fat man was dead?</li>
</ol>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>I did; I saw him dead,</li>
  <li>Breathless and bleeding on the ground. Art</li>
  <li>thou alive?</li>
  <li class="number">Or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight?</li>
  <li>I prithee, speak; we will not trust our eyes</li>
  <li>Without our ears: thou art not what thou seem'st.</li>

<ol class="speech">
  <li class="speaker">FALSTAFF</li>
  <li>No, that's certain; I am not a double man: but if I</li>
  <li>be not Jack Falstaff, then am I a Jack. There is Percy:</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">Throwing the body down</li>
  <li class="number">if your father will do me any honour, so; if not, let</li>
  <li>him kill the next Percy himself. I look to be either</li>

  <li class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</li>
  <li>Why, Percy I killed myself and saw thee dead.</li>

  <li>Didst thou? Lord, Lord, how this world is given to</li>
  <li class="number">lying! I grant you I was down and out of breath;</li>
  <li>and so was he: but we rose both at an instant and</li>
  <li>fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock. If I may be</li>
  <li>believed, so; if not, let them that should reward</li>
  <li>valour bear the sin upon their own heads. I'll take</li>
  <li class="number">it upon my death, I gave him this wound in the</li>
  <li>thigh: if the man were alive and would deny it,</li>
  <li>'zounds, I would make him eat a piece of my sword.</li>
