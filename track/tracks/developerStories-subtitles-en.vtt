The Web is always changing

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.300
and the way we access it is changing

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The source of that change is <c.highlight>you</c>

4
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.000
Developers all around the world who are using our tools to create great new things

5
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.200
and with so many tools, the sky is the limit

6
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.500
But it cant happen without you and your ideas

7
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.700
We want to know you better

8
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.000 
so we created a new place just for that

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000 
to hear from <u>you</u>

10
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.000 
We want to hear what inspires you as a developer

11
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.000 
and how we can help.

12
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.800 
Here you can record a video, share stories with us and more

13
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000 
Let us know what being a Google developer means to you

14
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.200 
and you can talk to us in person at Google Developer events all over the world.

15
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.000 
so we can learn how to support you better.

16
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.600 
Oh, btw, we also started rolling a new site for Google Developers

17
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.400 
Not just code but community, news, tools and other resources

18
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.000 
and cake

19
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.000 
Like any open source project it's a work in progress

20
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.000 
with your help it can be great
