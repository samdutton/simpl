<h3>Scene 1</h3>

<h4>Rome. A street.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter a company of mutinous Roman Citizens with staves, clubs, and other weapons.
	
		ALL. ROM. CIT.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="1. ROM. CIT.">
  <li>Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALL. ROM. CIT.">
  <li>Speak, speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. ROM. CIT.">
  <li>You are all resolv’d rather to die than to famish?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALL. ROM. CIT.">
  <li>Resolv’d, resolv’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. ROM. CIT.">
  <li data-number="5">First, you know Caius Martius is chief enemy to the people.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALL. ROM. CIT.">
  <li>We know’t, we know’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. ROM. CIT.">
  <li>Let us kill him, and we’ll have corn at our own price. Is’t a verdict?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALL. ROM. CIT.">
  <li>No more talking on’t; let it be done. Away, away!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. ROM. CIT.">
  <li>One word, good citizens.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. ROM. CIT.">
  <li data-number="10">We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good. What authority surfeits on would relieve us. If they would yield us but the superfluity while it were wholesome, we might guess they reliev’d us humanely; but they think we are too dear. The leanness that afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an inventory to particularize their abundance; our sufferance is a gain to them. Let us revenge this with our pikes, ere we become rakes; for the gods know I speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. ROM. CIT.">
  <li>Would you proceed especially against Caius Martius?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. ROM. CIT.">
  <li>Against him first; he’s a very dog to the commonalty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. ROM. CIT.">
  <li>Consider you what services he has done for his country?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. ROM. CIT.">
  <li>Very well, and could be content to give him good report for’t, but that he pays himself with being proud.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. ROM. CIT.">
  <li data-number="15">Nay, but speak not maliciously.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. ROM. CIT.">
  <li>I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did it to that end. Though soft-conscienc’d men can be content to say it was for his country, he did it to please his mother, and to be partly proud, which he is, even to the altitude of his virtue.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. ROM. CIT.">
  <li>What he cannot help in his nature, you account a vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. ROM. CIT.">
  <li>If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations; he hath faults (with surplus) to tire in repetition.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Shouts within.
	
	
</li>
  <li>What shouts are these? The other side a’ th’ city is risen; why stay we prating here? To th’ Capitol!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALL. ROM. CIT.">
  <li data-number="20">Come, come.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. ROM. CIT.">
  <li>Soft, who comes here?</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Menenius Agrippa.
	
		MEN.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="2. ROM. CIT.">
  <li>Worthy Menenius Agrippa, one that hath always lov’d the people.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. ROM. CIT.">
  <li>He’s one honest enough; would all the rest were so!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MEN.">
  <li>What work’s, my countrymen, in hand? Where go you</li>
  <li data-number="25">With bats and clubs? The matter? Speak, I pray you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. ROM. CIT.">
  <li>Our business is not unknown to th’ Senate; they have had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do, which now we’ll show ’em in deeds. They say poor suitors have strong breaths; they shall know we have strong arms too.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MEN.">
  <li>Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbors,</li>
  <li>Will you undo yourselves?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. ROM. CIT.">
  <li>We cannot, sir, we are undone already.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MEN.">
  <li data-number="30">I tell you, friends, most charitable care</li>
  <li>Have the patricians of you. For your wants,</li>
  <li>Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well</li>
  <li>Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them</li>
  <li>Against the Roman state, whose course will on</li>
  <li data-number="35">The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs</li>
  <li>Of more strong link asunder than can ever</li>
  <li>Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,</li>
  <li>The gods, not the patricians, make it, and</li>
  <li>Your knees to them (not arms) must help. Alack,</li>
  <li data-number="40">You are transported by calamity</li>
  <li>Thither where more attends you, and you slander</li>
  <li>The helms o’ th’ state, who care for you like fathers,</li>
  <li>When you curse them as enemies.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. ROM. CIT.">
  <li>Care for us? True indeed! They ne’er car’d for us yet. Suffer us to famish, and their store-houses cramm’d with grain; make edicts for usury, to support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act establish’d against the rich, and provide more piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and there’s all the love they bear us.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MEN.">
  <li data-number="45">Either you must</li>
  <li>Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,</li>
  <li>Or be accus’d of folly. I shall tell you</li>
  <li>A pretty tale. It may be you have heard it,</li>
  <li>But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture</li>
  <li data-number="50">To stale ’t a little more.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. ROM. CIT.">
  <li>Well, I’ll hear it, sir; yet you must not think to fob off our disgrace with a tale. But and’t please you, deliver.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MEN.">
  <li>There was a time when all the body’s members</li>
  <li>Rebell’d against the belly; thus accus’d it:</li>
  <li>That only like a gulf it did remain</li>
  <li data-number="55">I’ th’ midst a’ th’ body, idle and unactive,</li>
  <li>Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing</li>
  <li>Like labor with the rest, where th’ other instruments</li>
  <li>Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,</li>
  <li>And, mutually participate, did minister</li>
  <li data-number="60">Unto the appetite and affection common</li>
  <li>Of the whole body. The belly answer’d—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. ROM. CIT.">
  <li>Well, sir, what answer made the belly?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MEN.">
  <li>Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,</li>
  <li>Which ne’er came from the lungs, but even thus—</li>
  <li data-number="65">For, look you, I may make the belly smile</li>
  <li>As well as speak—it tauntingly replied</li>
  <li>To th’ discontented members, the mutinous parts</li>
  <li>That envied his receipt; even so most fitly</li>
  <li>As you malign our senators for that</li>
  <li>They are not such as you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. ROM. CIT.">
  <li data-number="70" data-offset="5">Your belly’s answer—what?</li>
  <li>The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,</li>
  <li>The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,</li>
  <li>Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter,</li>
  <li>With other muniments and petty helps</li>
  <li>In this our fabric, if that they—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MEN.">
  <li data-number="75" data-offset="7">What then?</li>
  <li>’Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? What then?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. ROM. CIT.">
  <li>Should by the cormorant belly be restrain’d,</li>
  <li>Who is the sink a’ th’ body—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MEN.">
  <li data-offset="6">Well, what then?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. ROM. CIT.">
  <li>The former agents, if they did complain,</li>
  <li>What could the belly answer?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MEN.">
  <li data-number="80" data-offset="6">I will tell you;</li>
  <li>If you’ll bestow a small (of what you have little)</li>
  <li>Patience awhile, you’st hear the belly’s answer.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. ROM. CIT.">
  <li>Y’ are long about it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MEN.">
  <li data-offset="4">Note me this, good friend:</li>
  <li>Your most grave belly was deliberate,</li>
  <li data-number="85">Not rash like his accusers, and thus answered:</li>
  <li>“True is it, my incorporate friends,” quoth he,</li>
  <li>“That I receive the general food at first</li>
  <li>Which you do live upon; and fit it is,</li>
  <li>Because I am the store-house and the shop</li>
  <li data-number="90">Of the whole body. But, if you do remember,</li>
  <li>I send it through the rivers of your blood,</li>
  <li>Even to the court, the heart, to th’ seat o’ th’ brain,</li>
  <li>And, through the cranks and offices of man,</li>
  <li>The strongest nerves and small inferior veins</li>
  <li data-number="95">From me receive that natural competency</li>
  <li>Whereby they live. And though that all at once”—</li>
  <li>You, my good friends, this says the belly, mark me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. ROM. CIT.">
  <li>Ay, sir, well, well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MEN.">
  <li data-offset="4">“Though all at once cannot</li>
  <li>See what I do deliver out to each,</li>
  <li data-number="100">Yet I can make my audit up, that all</li>
  <li>From me do back receive the flour of all,</li>
  <li>And leave me but the bran.” What say you to’t?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. ROM. CIT.">
  <li>It was an answer. How apply you this?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MEN.">
  <li>The senators of Rome are this good belly,</li>
  <li data-number="105">And you the mutinous members: for examine</li>
  <li>Their counsels and their cares; digest things rightly</li>
  <li>Touching the weal a’ th’ common, you shall find</li>
  <li>No public benefit which you receive</li>
  <li>But it proceeds or comes from them to you,</li>
  <li data-number="110">And no way from yourselves. What do you think,</li>
  <li>You, the great toe of this assembly?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. ROM. CIT.">
  <li>I the great toe? Why the great toe?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MEN.">
  <li>For that, being one o’ th’ lowest, basest, poorest</li>
  <li>Of this most wise rebellion, thou goest foremost;</li>
  <li data-number="115">Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,</li>
  <li>Lead’st first to win some vantage.</li>
  <li>But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs,</li>
  <li>Rome and her rats are at the point of battle,</li>
  <li>The one side must have bale.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Enter Caius Martius.
	
		MAR.
	
</li>
  <li data-offset="6">Hail, noble Martius!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAR.">
  <li data-number="120">Thanks. What’s the matter, you dissentious rogues,</li>
  <li>That rubbing the poor itch of your opinion</li>
  <li>Make yourselves scabs?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. ROM. CIT.">
  <li>We have ever your good word.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAR.">
  <li>He that will give good words to thee will flatter</li>
  <li data-number="125">Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,</li>
  <li>That like nor peace nor war? The one affrights you,</li>
  <li>The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,</li>
  <li>Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;</li>
  <li>Where foxes, geese. You are no surer, no,</li>
  <li data-number="130">Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,</li>
  <li>Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is</li>
  <li>To make him worthy whose offense subdues him,</li>
  <li>And curse that justice did it. Who deserves greatness</li>
  <li>Deserves your hate; and your affections are</li>
  <li data-number="135">A sick man’s appetite, who desires most that</li>
  <li>Which would increase his evil. He that depends</li>
  <li>Upon your favors swims with fins of lead,</li>
  <li>And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust ye?</li>
  <li>With every minute you do change a mind,</li>
  <li data-number="140">And call him noble, that was now your hate;</li>
  <li>Him vile, that was your garland. What’s the matter,</li>
  <li>That in these several places of the city</li>
  <li>You cry against the noble Senate, who</li>
  <li>(Under the gods) keep you in awe, which else</li>
  <li data-number="145">Would feed on one another? What’s their seeking?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MEN.">
  <li>For corn at their own rates, whereof they say</li>
  <li>The city is well stor’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAR.">
  <li data-offset="5">Hang ’em! They say?</li>
  <li>They’ll sit by th’ fire, and presume to know</li>
  <li>What’s done i’ th’ Capitol; who’s like to rise,</li>
  <li data-number="150">Who thrives, and who declines; side factions, and give out</li>
  <li>Conjectural marriages, making parties strong,</li>
  <li>And feebling such as stand not in their liking</li>
  <li>Below their cobbled shoes. They say there’s grain enough?</li>
  <li>Would the nobility lay aside their ruth</li>
  <li data-number="155">And let me use my sword, I’d make a quarry</li>
  <li>With thousands of these quarter’d slaves, as high</li>
  <li>As I could pick my lance.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MEN.">
  <li>Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;</li>
  <li>For though abundantly they lack discretion,</li>
  <li>Yet are they passing cowardly. But I beseech you,</li>
  <li>What says the other troop?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAR.">
  <li data-offset="5">They are dissolv’d. Hang ’em!</li>
  <li>They said they were an-hungry; sigh’d forth proverbs—</li>
  <li>That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,</li>
  <li>That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not</li>
  <li data-number="165">Corn for the rich men only. With these shreds</li>
  <li>They vented their complainings, which being answer’d,</li>
  <li>And a petition granted them—a strange one,</li>
  <li>To break the heart of generosity</li>
  <li>And make bold power look pale—they threw their caps</li>
  <li>As they would hang them on the horns a’ th’ moon,</li>
  <li>Shouting their emulation.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MEN.">
  <li data-offset="5">What is granted them?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAR.">
  <li>Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,</li>
  <li>Of their own choice. One’s Junius Brutus,</li>
  <li>Sicinius Velutus, and I know not—’sdeath,</li>
  <li data-number="175">The rabble should have first unroof’d the city</li>
  <li>Ere so prevail’d with me; it will in time</li>
  <li>Win upon power, and throw forth greater themes</li>
  <li>For insurrection’s arguing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VOL.">
  <li>I pray you, daughter, sing, or express yourself in a more comfortable sort. If my son were my husband, I should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he won honor than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love. When yet he was but tender-bodied and the only son of my womb; when youth with comeliness pluck’d all gaze his way; when for a day of kings’ entreaties a mother should not sell him an hour from her beholding; I, considering how honor would become such a person, that it was no better than picture-like to hang by th’ wall, if renown made it not stir, was pleas’d to let him seek danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel war I sent him, from whence he return’d, his brows bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child than now in first seeing he had prov’d himself a man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VIR.">
  <li>But had he died in the business, madam, how then?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VOL.">
  <li>Then his good report should have been my son; I therein would have found issue. Hear me profess sincerely; had I a dozen sons, each in my love alike, and none less dear than thine and my good Martius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.</li>

  <li data-number="10">Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:</li>
  <li>“Come on, you cowards, you were got in fear,</li>
  <li>Though you were born in Rome!” His bloody brow</li>
  <li>With his mail’d hand then wiping, forth he goes,</li>

  <li>His bloody brow? O Jupiter, no blood!</li>

  <li>Away, you fool! It more becomes a man</li>

  <li>A’ my word, the father’s son. I’ll swear ’tis a very pretty boy. A’ my troth, I look’d upon him a’ We’n’sday half an hour together; h’as such a confirm’d countenance. I saw him run after a gilded butterfly, and when he caught it, he let it go again, and after it again, and over and over he comes, and up again; catch’d it again: or whether his fallen rag’d him, or how ’twas, he did so set his teeth and tear it.

<ol data-speaker="VIR.">
  <li data-number="50">Indeed, madam?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VAL.">
  <li>In earnest, it’s true; I heard a senator speak it. Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; against whom Cominius the general is gone, with one part of our Roman power. Your lord and Titus Lartius are set down before their city Corioles; they nothing doubt prevailing, and to make it brief wars. This is true, on mine honor, and so I pray go with us.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VIR.">
  <li>Give me excuse, good madam, I will obey you in every thing hereafter.</li>

When you are hearing a matter between party and party, if you chance to be pinch’d with the colic, you make faces like mummers, set up the bloody flag against all patience, and in roaring for a chamber-pot, dismiss the controversy bleeding, the more entangled by your hearing. All the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties knaves. You are a pair of strange ones.</li>

  <li>Three, they say; but ’tis thought of every one Coriolanus will carry it.</li>

<ol data-speaker="2. OFF.">
  <li>Faith, there hath been many great men that have flatter’d the people, who ne’er lov’d them; and there be many that they have lov’d, they know not wherefore; so that, if they love they know not why, they hate upon no better a ground. Therefore, for Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition, and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly see’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. OFF.">
  <li data-number="5">If he did not care whether he had their love or no, he wav’d indifferently ’twixt doing them neither good nor harm; but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can render it him, and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover him their opposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes, to flatter them for their love.</li>

  <li>He hath deserv’d worthily of his country, and his ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who, having been supple and courteous to the people, bonneted, without any further deed to have them at all into their estimation and report. But he hath so planted his honors in their eyes and his actions in their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confess so much were a kind of ingrateful injury; to report otherwise were a malice that, giving itself the lie, would pluck reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.</li>

  <li>An o’erpress’d Roman, and i’ th’ consul’s view</li>
  <li data-number="65">Slew three opposers. Tarquin’s self he met,</li>
  <li>And struck him on his knee. In that day’s feats,</li>
  <li>When he might act the woman in the scene,</li>
  <li>He prov’d best man i’ th’ field, and for his meed</li>
  <li>Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age</li>
  <li data-number="70">Man-ent’red thus, he waxed like a sea,</li>
  <li>And in the brunt of seventeen battles since</li>
  <li>He lurch’d all swords of the garland. For this last,</li>
  <li>Before and in Corioles, let me say,</li>
  <li>I cannot speak him home. He stopp’d the fliers,</li>
  <li data-number="75">And by his rare example made the coward</li>
  <li>Turn terror into sport; as weeds before</li>
  <li>A vessel under sail, so men obey’d</li>
  <li>And fell below his stem. His sword, death’s stamp,</li>
  <li>Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot</li>
  <li data-number="80">He was a thing of blood, whose every motion</li>
  <li>Was tim’d with dying cries. Alone he ent’red</li>
  <li>The mortal gate of th’ city, which he painted</li>
  <li>With shunless destiny; aidless came off,</li>
  <li>And with a sudden reinforcement struck</li>
  <li data-number="85">Corioles like a planet. Now all’s his,</li>
  <li>When by and by the din of war ’gan pierce</li>
  <li>His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit</li>
  <li>Requick’ned what in flesh was fatigate,</li>
  <li>And to the battle came he, where he did</li>
  <li data-number="90">Run reeking o’er the lives of men, as if</li>
  <li>’Twere a perpetual spoil; and till we call’d</li>
  <li>Both field and city ours, he never stood</li>

  <li>We may, sir, if we will.</li>

<ol data-speaker="3. ROM. CIT.">
  <li>We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a power that we have no power to do; for if he show us his wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our tongues into those wounds and speak for them; so, if he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude
 is monstrous, and for the multitude to be 
ingrateful were to make a monster of the multitude; of the which we being members, should bring ourselves to be monstrous members.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. ROM. CIT.">

  <li data-number="95">The horn and noise o’ th’ monster’s, wants not spirit</li>
  <li>To say he’ll turn your current in a ditch,</li>

  <li>Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn’d,</li>
  <li data-number="100">Be not as common fools; if you are not,</li>

  <li>Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,</li>
  <li data-number="105">And such a one as he, who puts his ’shall,’</li>
  <li>His popular ‘shall,’ against a graver bench</li>
  <li>Than ever frown’d in Greece. By Jove himself,</li>

<ol data-speaker="COR.">
  <li data-offset="7">I’ll give my reasons,</li>
  <li data-number="120">More worthier than their voices. They know the corn</li>
  <li>Was not our recompense, resting well assur’d</li>
  <li>They ne’er did service for’t; being press’d to th’ war,</li>
  <li>Even when the navel of the state was touch’d,</li>
  <li>They would not thread the gates. This kind of service</li>
  <li data-number="125">Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i’ th’ war,</li>
  <li>Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show’d</li>
  <li>Most valor, spoke not for them. Th’ accusation</li>
  <li>Which they have often made against the Senate,</li>
  <li>All cause unborn, could never be the native</li>
  <li data-number="130">Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?</li>
  <li>How shall this bosom multiplied digest</li>
  <li>The Senate’s courtesy? Let deeds express</li>
  <li>What’s like to be their words: “We did request it,</li>
  <li>We are the greater poll, and in true fear</li>
  <li data-number="135">They gave us our demands.” Thus we debase</li>
  <li>The nature of our seats and make the rabble</li>
  <li>Call our cares fears; which will in time</li>
  <li>Break ope the locks a’ th’ Senate, and bring in</li>
  <li>The crows to peck the eagles.</li>

  <li>Where one part does disdain with cause, the other</li>
  <li>Insult without all reason; where gentry, title, wisdom,</li>
  <li data-number="145">Cannot conclude but by the yea and no</li>
  <li>Of general ignorance—it must omit</li>
  <li>Real necessities, and give way the while</li>

  <li>Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore beseech you—</li>
  <li data-number="150">You that will be less fearful than discreet;</li>
  <li>That love the fundamental part of state</li>

  <li data-number="155">That’s sure of death without it—at once pluck out</li>

  <li>It is so, sir. Truly, I have forgot you.</li>

  <li data-number="5">The same, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ADR.">
  <li>You had more beard when I last saw you, but your favor is well appear’d by your tongue. What’s the news in Rome? I have a note from the Volscian state to find you out there. You have well sav’d me a day’s journey.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NIC.">
  <li>There hath been in Rome strange insurrections; the people against the senators, patricians, and nobles.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ADR.">
  <li>Hath been! Is it ended then? Our state thinks not so; they are in a most warlike preparation, and hope to come upon them in the heat of their division.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NIC.">
  <li>The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing would make it flame again; for the nobles receive so to heart the banishment of that worthy Coriolanus, that they are in a ripe aptness to take all power from the people, and to pluck from them their tribunes forever. This lies glowing, I can tell you, and is almost mature for the violent breaking out.</li>

  <li>You will be welcome with this intelligence, Nicanor.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NIC.">
  <li>The day serves well for them now. I have heard it said, the fittest time to corrupt a man’s wife is when she’s fall’n out with her husband. Your noble Tullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars, his great opposer Coriolanus being now in no request of his country.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ADR.">
  <li>He cannot choose. I am most fortunate thus accidentally to encounter you. You have ended my business, and I will merrily accompany you home.</li>

  <li>A most royal one: the centurions and their charges, distinctly billeted, already in th’ entertainment, and to be on foot at an hour’s warning.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NIC.">
  <li>I am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am the man, I think, that shall set them in present action. So, sir, heartily well met, and most glad of your company.</li>

  <li>I do not say “thwack our general,” but he was always good enough for him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. SERV.">
  <li>Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too hard for him; I have heard him say so himself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. SERV.">
  <li data-number="155">He was too hard for him, directly to say the troth on’t,
before Corioles; he scotch’d him and notch’d him like a carbonado.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. SERV.">
  <li>And he had been cannibally given, he might have boil’d and eaten him too.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. SERV.">
  <li>But more of thy news.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="3. SERV.">
  <li>Why, he is so made on here within as if he were son and heir to Mars; set at upper end o’ th’ table; no question ask’d him by any of the senators but they stand bald before him. Our general himself makes a mistress of him, sanctifies himself with ’s hand, and turns up the white o’ th’ eye to his discourse. But the bottom of the news is, our general is cut i’ th’ middle, and but one half of what he was yesterday; for the other has half by the entreaty and grant of the whole table. He’ll go, he says, and sowl the porter of Rome gates by th’ ears. He will mow all down before him, and leave his passage poll’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. SERV.">
  <li>And he’s as like to do’t as any man I can imagine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="3. SERV.">
  <li data-number="160">Do’t? He will do’t; for look you, sir, he has as many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it were, durst not (look you, sir) show themselves (as we term it) his friends whilest he’s in directitude.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. SERV.">
  <li>Directitude? What’s that?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="3. SERV.">
  <li>But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again and the man in blood, they will out of their burrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. SERV.">
  <li>But when goes this forward?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="3. SERV.">
  <li>Tomorrow, today, presently; you shall have the drum struck up this afternoon. ’Tis, as it were, a parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they wipe their lips.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. SERV.">
  <li data-number="165">Why then we shall have a stirring world again. This peace is nothing but to rust iron, increase tailors, and breed ballad-makers.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. SERV.">
  <li>Let me have war, say I, it exceeds peace as far as day does night; it’s sprightly, waking, audible, and full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy, mull’d, deaf, sleepy, insensible, a getter of more bastard children than war’s a destroyer of men.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. SERV.">
  <li>’Tis so, and as wars, in some sort, may be said to be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a great maker of cuckolds.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. SERV.">
  <li>Ay, and it makes men hate one another.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="3. SERV.">
  <li>Reason: because they then less need one another. The wars for my money! I hope to see Romans as cheap as Volscians.—They are rising, they are rising.</li>

Can you think to blow out the intended fire your city is ready to flame in, with such weak breath as this? No, you are deceiv’d; therefore back to Rome, and prepare for your execution.
